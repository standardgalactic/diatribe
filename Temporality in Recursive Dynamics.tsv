0	2780	Have you ever just felt completely swamped?
3120	7020	You know, the feeling of information overload, like you're just wading through data,
7200	10620	wishing you could cut through it all, and well, actually get what's important.
10940	14080	If that sounds familiar, you are definitely in the right place.
15100	16480	Welcome to the Deep Dive.
16560	20720	Today we are diving headfirst into something truly mind-bending,
20960	22520	temporality and recursive dynamics.
22660	25940	This stuff comes from a really fascinating collection of sources we've been digging into,
26580	29340	collectively, called the Diatribe Repository.
29340	32620	And our mission today, it's unpacked this pretty radical idea.
33160	35060	What if time isn't just this fixed backdrop?
35580	38980	What if it's something that actually emerges, shaped by recursive processes?
39540	41840	And crucially, how understanding that changes?
42540	46440	Well, pretty much everything, from our own thoughts to how the universe itself might evolve.
46700	47520	It really is remarkable.
47620	51320	And what's fascinating here is how these concepts, they move beyond just abstract theory.
51400	57240	They actually offer practical insights into things like control, learning, even how we tell stories.
57340	59240	This deep dive, I think, will show how...
59340	63620	the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum, let's call it RSVP and its partner,
63880	66360	this recursive tiling system called Tartan,
66660	72020	how they give us a unified way to look at these dynamics across fields that seem, you know, totally separate on the surface.
72120	74340	OK, let's jump right into that central idea then.
74380	76320	Time, not a clock.
76500	76740	Yeah.
76960	77860	What does that actually mean?
78060	81240	You mentioned the Aletheos canonical form, ACF and RSVP.
81580	82700	How did they define this?
82960	86960	Right. So in ACF, one of these key repository texts,
87360	89200	time is explicitly defined as n.
89200	92540	Time is an emergent property, and crucially, it's scale dependent.
92620	93700	It's not just a given.
93740	100800	It's something that arises from the interplay of entropy, think disorder scale, and these things called causal constraints within a system.
101460	104180	The Dirac delta function is actually pretty central here.
104200	105640	It helps model locality.
106120	111040	Instead of time flowing smoothly everywhere, it lets the system focus dynamics at specific points.
111080	114880	Think of them like hotspots of information processing density.
115160	117040	That's where time really makes itself felt.
117340	117920	Wow. OK.
117940	119180	So time, literally,
119240	120640	sort of pops out of the system.
120680	122700	It's not just an external constant ticking away.
123220	125280	And how does RSVP connect with that idea?
125320	126720	How does it see emergent time?
127060	136020	RSVP, well, if we connect this to the bigger picture, it derives temporal flow, that feeling of time moving forward directly from entropic gradients and vector flux.
136400	137600	Imagine a river, right?
137620	139260	The flow isn't some external force.
139320	141840	It emerges from the landscape, the water's properties.
141880	142380	OK.
142380	148560	So entropic gradients are like differences in order versus disorder, and vector flux is the directed flow.
148560	156100	Like information moving with purpose, it's these imbalances and flows that create the progression of time, which, of course, raises a really big question.
156700	160860	If time emerges, what actually makes it flow in the direction we experience?
160880	161520	Yeah, exactly.
161760	163740	And this is where I think it gets really interesting.
164060	173220	If time emerges from these dynamics, how do recursive processes, processes that loop back on themselves, actually build structure, build meaning within that emergent time?
173600	176320	You mentioned universal emergence theory, UIT, and Tartan.
176640	177400	How do they fit in?
177640	177940	OK.
177940	181820	So UIT introduces this idea called a scalar recursion law.
182280	186500	Basically, distinctions or bits of information accumulate over time, and that drives expansion.
187040	193120	RSVP takes this idea and generalizes it, embedding recursion right into these spatio-temporal fields we talked about.
193480	198880	And Tartan, Tartan is the infrastructure that lets RSVP actually do this.
198880	200860	Think of it like a system of recursive tiles.
201240	207920	It breaks down scale and assigns each tile its own localized recursion, its own entropy level, even its own speed of causation.
207940	212180	It makes the whole theoretical recursion sort of tangible, manageable.
212220	212560	Got it.
212880	214160	So Tartan makes it concrete.
215320	218120	But what happens to information in these recursive systems then?
218740	222420	As time emerges and flows, how is information stored or changed?
222580	223360	That's a key point.
223360	224480	How is information stored?
224480	226880	Well, within Tartan, you can have what are called frozen tiles.
227340	228720	These tiles don't evolve internally.
228720	234380	They act like memory modules or maybe fixed anchors for meaning in a larger recursive computation.
234780	237820	They basically store information for recursion happening at a higher scale.
237820	243400	It connects beautifully, actually, to philosopher Julian Barber's idea of time capsules.
243580	248460	Time capsules, like snapshots of reality holding meaning outside of the flow.
248500	250000	That's a really powerful image.
250040	250720	Exactly.
250720	254100	But what about more abstract things like ideas or meaning itself?
254480	258580	How do they get frozen or maybe propagate recursively over time?
258860	261840	Ah, well, that leads us to another concept from the repository.
262060	262780	Thrisps.
262900	263440	Thrisps.
263500	264140	Thrisps.
264440	267220	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
267220	267460	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
267460	267760	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
267760	267960	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
267960	268120	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
268120	268380	They're described as self-propagating, autocatalytic, semantic, and dynamic.
268680	274220	Think of them as recursive instructions or ideas that actively defend themselves and try to replicate.
274680	278980	Like a piece of paper that says, don't throw this out or make copies of this.
279320	282040	That instruction turns the paper into a simple thresp.
282300	283700	Or like a catchy tune, maybe.
283920	284580	Or a meme.
285040	285480	Precisely.
285640	286720	A meme is a perfect example.
286840	293800	It's like a cognitive organism building these replicable patterns that get set loose in the new sphere, the realm of thought and culture.
294000	294800	Okay, that makes sense.
294800	297620	Can you give us a concrete example and maybe something historical?
297760	303200	what's called semantic incision and field inscription how does meaning get cut into
303200	308320	reality so to speak yeah there's a fascinating comparison made in the sources between bixing's
308320	314080	movable type printing in 11th century china and a specific retranslation of genesis 1.27
314720	320080	both interestingly describe a process of encoding and replicating structured meaning into some kind
320080	325760	of receptive medium oh so while bixing didn't just conjure characters he cut form into clay
325760	330400	he inscribed structure and similarly this retranslation of genesis describes
330400	336000	the act of creation not as making something from nothing but as cutting a pattern into
336000	341600	the plenum the underlying field it's a semantic act an act of imposing meaningful form not just
341600	347600	brute force exactly in rsvp terms you describe it as sculpting a low entropy high vector coherence
347600	352320	attractor a stable pattern of meaning in the semantic field guided by a specific uh
352320	355680	vectorial directive or intention okay this is really shifting my perspective
355760	361600	so if meaning and time are these dynamic fields how does this apply to say our own minds or even ai
361600	367120	great question in rsvp cognition itself is understood through these interacting fields
367120	374000	a scalar field for semantic potential the raw stuff of meaning a vector field v for referential
374000	380800	flow like attention and an entropy field s for ambiguity or uncertainty thinking about cognition
380800	385600	this way really um dramatically shifts how we understand mental states including the
385760	386560	world's most complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and
386560	386880	complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and complex and
386880	392560	emotions that's interesting because you know most of us think of emotions as well things like
392560	397520	pressure building up something you can bottle or release how does this field view explain something
397520	402720	so personal right that's the common metaphor like pneumatic liquids or gases but from a perceptual
402720	407760	control theory pct perspective which pops up in the repository emotions aren't things like that
407760	413200	at all there are cognitive and perceptual signals of a discrepancy discrepancy yeah the gap between
413200	415680	what you predict or expect and what actually happens
416160	420960	emotions signal shifts in your planning your executive control they're like prediction failure
420960	427280	alerts so anger for instance in rsvp terms that would be a disordered scalar vector dynamic a
427280	432320	spike in entropy maybe misaligned vector fields it reflects a breakdown in effective planning or
432320	438880	control and restoring function feeling better means reconfiguring those fields finding ways to lower
438880	444720	the entropy create more coherent plans over time restoring the flow that's yeah that's a huge shift
444720	445680	okay what are we going to do about this we're going to do a lot of work on this we're going to do a lot
445680	445720	of work on this we're going to do a lot of work on this we're going to do a lot of work on this we're going
445720	445880	to do a lot of work on this we're going to do a lot of work on this we're going to do a lot of work on this
445880	451000	something like making analogies our minds seem to do that almost instantaneously how does that fit
451000	456440	into a field that evolves over time ah the adapter model another piece from the repository maps
456440	461640	really nicely onto rsvp here it interprets analogical retrieval not as an instant lookup
461640	466280	but as a relaxation process in a kind of thermodynamic field like water settling
466280	471080	exactly like water settling your current mental state the field configuration
471080	475640	seeks a lower energy alignment it tries to fit itself to known attractor patterns
475640	476120	it tries to fit itself to known attractor patterns
476120	479480	familiar ways of thinking modulated by those entropy gradients
480280	484440	the best analogy is simply the pattern that represents a low entropy highly coherent
484440	491080	structural match it feels fast but it's actually a dynamic time dependent alignment process okay
491080	495800	and bringing this to a really pressing issue ai how does this understanding of
495800	501000	dynamic fields emergent time help us think about ai alignment and control that seems
501000	505320	like a huge challenge it is huge and forest landry another voice in the repository argued
505320	509960	that truly controlling super intelligent agi might even be impossible because the complexity just
509960	515080	scales too fast but uh there's also work like from coraggio and others on graph based control
515080	519560	frameworks that suggest a kind of middle ground maybe scalable oversight is possible not by
519560	524440	understanding every internal detail but by targeting key nodes or modulating interactions
524440	529400	within the ai's network like nudging the system sort of it connects to this idea of controlling
529400	535160	complex systems by imposing desirable global behavior like ensuring the ai follows non-deceptive
535320	540680	policies without needing full internal access or understanding what's fascinating here too is how
540680	545400	this contrasts with something like chain of thought or cod in ai which we hear a lot about for
545400	551320	interpretability there's this other idea chain of memory com how does that offer a different view on
551320	557960	ai thinking over time right com basically argues that cod often just gives us post hoc justifications
557960	564120	plausible stories that ai tells after the fact not the actual reasoning process true ai reasoning
565320	570040	deeper down in a meaningful causally structured substrate it's latent memory the language it
570040	576520	outputs that's often just a secondary translation layer optional even so memory first language second
576520	584840	exactly com reframes ai cognition as memory first language optional it emphasizes tracing the actual
584840	589640	causal path through the evolution of its latent memory states its vector states over time
589640	595000	it means the ai should ideally think before it speaks and its reasoning is structurally embedded
595320	600200	in the brain so it's not just you know stylistically added on afterwards so forgetting the idea of
600200	606920	a static blueprint for the brain rsvp suggests something much more fluid dynamic absolutely
606920	612760	way more fluid take cortical columns in the brain rsvp reinterprets them not as fixed processors but
612760	617480	as amplitwist operators amplitwist operators yeah they're local geometric operators they combine
617480	622440	rotation and scaling acting on neural representations so think of it your brain isn't just
622440	625240	shuffling files it's constantly transforming semantic spaces
625240	629960	concepts get bent twisted scaled by these operators as they interact and evolve over time
629960	634600	it gives the brain this incredible universal function approximation property
634600	639000	it means there's tremendous flexibility in representation all while maintaining a kind
639000	644440	of topological consistency neural representations become like sections of fiber bundles over the
644440	648360	cortical surface it's a very dynamic picture okay the implications here feel huge
649000	654520	if these dynamic time evolving fields apply to minds could they apply much wider
655240	660520	like to entire stories or even the cosmos itself well if we connect this to the bigger picture
660520	666600	again yes storytelling itself can be viewed through this lens of recursive entropy relaxation
667320	672280	each plot point each act in a story isn't just linear progression it's more like a relaxation
672280	678120	cycle the narrative system finds a temporary equilibrium a state of lowered entropy or tension
678120	682520	only for it to be destabilized again driving the story forward you could map that you could
682520	684680	potentially visualize it with say
685240	690680	dynamic entropy heat maps of a narrative spotting where a story feels like it's stagnating or maybe
690680	695960	getting overloaded different genres might even have characteristic entropy signatures over time
695960	700760	you know why certain genre blends just feel right it might be down to their entropy profiles being
700760	706200	compatible a story in this view becomes a kind of complete space-time structure
706200	710920	where the local parts contain the relationships needed to reconstruct the whole narrative as it
710920	715160	unfolds in its emergent time that is a truly cosmic thought
715720	721000	so naturally the next question the u versus evolution can we see that through this lens
721000	726120	of emergent time and recursion too it's definitely out there but yes the expirosis cosmological
726120	730760	framework another concept from the repository suggests something pretty radical it postulates
730760	734680	that cosmic structure didn't just arise from rapid inflation after the big bang
734680	739000	instead it might arise from the long time scale reintegration of decohered information
739560	744680	confirmation lost essentially from the cosmic microwave background the cmb reintegration
745240	751320	over immense time scales poincare recurrence times this entropic memory encoded somehow in scalar
751320	755960	and vector fields lingering from the early universe gets reabsorbed into local dynamics
755960	760920	the idea is that structure emerges by recapturing this lost information over vast stretches of time
760920	764760	through mechanisms like field coherence and semantic resonance it points to
764760	770120	really profound recursive temporal dynamics on a truly universal scale mind-blowing okay let's
770120	774840	bring it back down to earth a bit after this incredible deep dive into temporality and recursive
775240	779800	dynamics how does all this inform something really practical like how we learn yeah what's
779800	784520	fascinating here is how neatly things like self-paced mastery learning or even curriculum
784520	790200	design can map onto rsvp concepts you can think of learning trajectories as evolving over time
790200	794760	along paths that minimize entropy reducing uncertainty creating coherence in your
794760	800120	understanding the scalar field gradients align with these pathways so learnings is like finding
800120	805240	the most ordered path through information in a sense yes even something like say doing a
805240	810200	intensive course over a year and a half maybe that master of dialectic prose mentioned in the sources
810200	816520	with 365 lectures can be seen as iterative coherent sharpening it's a structured dialogue with the
816520	821720	material mapped perhaps to the temporal autocorrelation how correlated the state is with
821720	827160	itself over time of your internal semantic potential field the cuff field it highlights
827160	832440	learning as this continuous recursive process concepts aren't just learned once they're
832440	835240	constantly refined integrated sharpened over time
835880	839880	which naturally raises an important question how could we intentionally design learning
839880	845320	environments to better leverage these natural time-dependent field dynamics wow okay what an
845320	849560	absolutely incredible journey through temporality and recursive dynamics we've really seen how these
849560	855000	frameworks from the diatribe repository area rsvp tartan offer this unified language a way to
855000	859640	describe how time itself seems to emerge from this intricate recursive dance of information and it
859640	864280	applies everywhere from the tiniest cognitive processes right up to the scale of the cosmos
864280	865080	it really does find a lot of value in the way that we use the term time-dependent field dynamics to
865080	892840	knee and use as a term talking about the
892840	893800	associated consciousness as it is with your core спp
893800	894520	though it U. U.
894520	899580	flow of information. And if your thoughts, your ideas are like those thrisps, self-propagating
899580	904660	patterns you release into the world, then every decision you make, every concept you really grasp,
904780	910400	every story you tell, it's all actively sculpting the emergent temporal landscape of your reality
910400	914860	and maybe influencing the wider new sphere too. So the question to leave you with is,
914860	917440	what kind of temporal landscape are you creating today?
