### Emergent Structures and Control in Neural and Cosmic Systems: A Unified Field-Theoretic Approach
Author
: Flyxion
Date
: July 13, 2025
#### Abstract
This paper presents a unified field-theoretic framework for understanding emergent structures and control in neural, cosmic, and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, leveraging the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) and its recursive extension, Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN). Integrating insights from the cortical column debate (Horton & Adams, 2005), parameter-efficient deep learning (Denil et al., 2013), Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) (LeCun et al., 1989), and control theory for complex systems and AI alignment (Sandberg et al., 2025; Coraggio et al., 2025), we propose that complex structures arise from the interplay of scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields. In cosmology, this manifests as Expyrotic reintegration of cosmic microwave background (CMB) information. In neuroscience, cortical columns are reinterpreted as amplitwist operators enabling universal function approximation. In AI, control-theoretic models address alignment challenges through sparse, structure-aware interventions. RSVP and TARTAN unify these domains via thermodynamic principles, sparsity-driven computation, and graph-based control, offering a scalable paradigm for emergent intelligence. The Mathematical Appendix formalizes these dynamics, providing computational methods for simulation and validation.
#### 1. Introduction
The emergence of complex structures—galaxies in the cosmos, cognitive representations in the brain, and behaviors in artificial general intelligence (AGI)—poses fundamental challenges across disciplines. In cosmology, inflationary models rely on fine-tuned initial conditions (Guth, 1981). In neuroscience, cortical columns exhibit clear anatomical structure but ambiguous functional roles (Horton & Adams, 2005). In AI, deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but face parameter inefficiency (Denil et al., 2013) and alignment challenges (Sandberg et al., 2025). Control theory offers a unifying lens, with recent work on complex systems (Coraggio et al., 2025) highlighting scalable, structure-aware interventions to steer emergent behaviors.
This paper introduces the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, extended by Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN), to model emergent structures and control across these domains. RSVP posits that scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields evolve over four-dimensional space-time (R^4), driven by entropic relaxation and nonlocal coupling. TARTAN recursively tiles fields into coherence zones, enabling multi-scale computation. We synthesize:
-
Expyrotic Cosmology
: CMB reintegration over Poincaré timescales, using sparsity-driven methods (Denil et al., 2013).
-
Cortical Columns
: Amplitwist operators for universal function approximation (Horton & Adams, 2005).
-
Parameter Efficiency
: OBD (LeCun et al., 1989) and RBF-based prediction (Denil et al., 2013).
-
AI Alignment
: Control-theoretic models for scalable oversight (Sandberg et al., 2025; Coraggio et al., 2025).
-
Geometric Bayesianism (GBSH)
: Biological sparsity via thermodynamic constraints.
The essay explores these connections, and the Mathematical Appendix formalizes the dynamics and computational methods.
#### 2. Emergent Structures and Control via RSVP and TARTAN
RSVP models emergent phenomena using scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields, with TARTAN enabling recursive, trajectory-aware computation. This section synthesizes RSVP and TARTAN with cosmological, neural, and AI control perspectives.
##### 2.1 RSVP Framework: Scalar-Vector-Entropy Dynamics
RSVP generalizes thermodynamic and geometric principles:
-
Scalar Field (Φ)
: Encodes energy, meaning, or neural activation.
-
Vector Field (v)
: Directs information flow, attention, or inference.
-
Entropy Field (S)
: Quantifies disorder, driving sparsity and coherence.
Fields evolve via coupled partial differential equations, producing sparse attractors aligned with GBSH's Natural Sparsity Principle.
##### 2.2 Expyrotic Cosmology: CMB Reintegration
Expyrotic Cosmology reframes cosmic structure formation as reintegration of decohered CMB information over Poincaré timescales (T_P). The CMB, a semantic horizon, encodes latent field configurations re-synchronized by Φ, v, and S, producing homogeneity and scale-invariant perturbations without singularities. Sparsity-driven reconstruction (Denil et al., 2013) enhances computational efficiency.
##### 2.3 Cortical Columns as Amplitwist Operators
Horton and Adams (2005) highlight the functional ambiguity of cortical columns. We propose columns as geometric operators implementing amplitwist transformations (zoom and rotation) on neural representations, enabling:
- Flexible scaling and reorientation of spatial or semantic maps.
- Recursive composition for universal function approximation.
- Dynamic coherence zones in RSVP, shaped by Φ, v, and S.
TARTAN's recursive tiling generalizes this, adaptively partitioning fields to address columnar variability.
##### 2.4 Parameter Efficiency and OBD
Denil et al. (2013) demonstrate that over 95% of neural network weights can be predicted from a small subset using RBF interpolation. RSVP adopts this, reconstructing Φ from anchor points. Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) (LeCun et al., 1989) prunes weights with low saliency via second-order derivatives. RSVP generalizes this:
-
Thermodynamic Pruning
: Entropic relaxation suppresses incoherent weights.
-
Amplitwist Compression
: Columns encode complexity geometrically, reducing parameter needs.
-
TARTAN Saliency
: Coherence tiles identify high-entropy regions for retention.
##### 2.5 AI Alignment and Control Theory
Sandberg et al. (2025) explore whether AGI is intrinsically unalignable due to control complexity, with Landry arguing that control resources scale worse than system complexity. Coraggio et al. (2025) offer a framework for controlling complex systems via:
-
Node Control
: Targeting key agents (e.g., high-leverage neurons).
-
Edge Control
: Modulating interactions (e.g., attention weights).
-
Pinning Control
: Controlling a subset of nodes to steer global behavior.
RSVP aligns with this by using S to identify high-saliency regions and TARTAN to apply localized interventions, enabling scalable oversight without full observability.
##### 2.6 Geometric Bayesianism and Biological Sparsity
GBSH posits sparse, noisy heuristics for efficient inference. RSVP's entropy-driven dynamics and TARTAN's noise-injected tiling align with this:
- S minimizes complexity, producing sparse configurations.
- v directs inference flow, akin to Bayesian navigation.
- TARTAN's noise explores semantic attractors, mirroring stochastic resonance.
##### 2.7 Observational and Computational Implications
In cosmology:
-
Low Tensor Modes
: Negligible gravitational waves.
-
CMB Coherence
: Anomalies reflecting semantic memory.
-
Entropy Signatures
: Anisotropic dark energy.
In neuroscience:
-
Dynamic Columns
: Flexible coherence zones.
-
Amplitwist Functions
: Universal approximation.
-
Sparse Coding
: Entropy-driven efficiency.
In AI:
-
Scalable Oversight
: Pinning control of high-saliency nodes.
-
Robustness
: Lyapunov-based safety envelopes.
-
Tractability
: Sparse interventions via TARTAN.
These can be tested via simulations and data analysis (e.g., CMB, neural recordings, AI behavior).
