More
A photodiode is a semiconductor diode sensitive to photon radiation, such as visible light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.[1] It produces an electrical current when it absorbs photons. This can be used for detection and measurement applications, or for the generation of electrical power in solar cells. Photodiodes are used in a wide range of applications throughout the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light photocells to gamma ray spectrometers.

Principle of operation
edit
A photodiode is a PIN structure or p-n junction. When a photon of sufficient energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism is also known as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is passed in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.[2] Therefore, photodiodes operate most ideally in reverse bias.

To first order, for a given spectral distribution, the photocurrent is linearly proportional to the irradiance.[3]

Photovoltaic mode
edit

I-V characteristic of a photodiode. The linear load lines represent the response of the external circuit: I=(Applied bias voltage-Diode voltage)/Total resistance. The points of intersection with the curves represent the actual current and voltage for a given bias, resistance and illumination.
In photovoltaic mode (zero bias), photocurrent flows into the anode through a short circuit to the cathode. If the circuit is opened or has a load impedance, restricting the photocurrent out of the device, a voltage builds up in the direction that forward biases the diode, that is, anode positive with respect to cathode. If the circuit is shorted or the impedance is low, a forward current will consume all or some of the photocurrent. This mode exploits the photovoltaic effect, which is the basis for solar cells - a traditional solar cell is just a large area photodiode. For optimum power output, the photovoltaic cell will be operated at a voltage that causes only a small forward current compared to the photocurrent.[3]

Photoconductive mode
edit
In photoconductive mode the diode is reverse biased, that is, with the cathode driven positive with respect to the anode. This reduces the response time because the additional reverse bias increases the width of the depletion layer, which decreases the junction's capacitance and increases the region with an electric field that will cause electrons to be quickly collected. The reverse bias also creates dark current without much change in the photocurrent.

Although this mode is faster, the photoconductive mode can exhibit more electronic noise due to dark current or avalanche effects.[4] The leakage current of a good PIN diode is so low (<1 nA) that the Johnson-Nyquist noise of the load resistance in a typical circuit often dominates.

Related devices
edit
Avalanche photodiodes are photodiodes with structure optimized for operating with high reverse bias, approaching the reverse breakdown voltage. This allows each photo-generated carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective responsivity of the device.[5]


Electronic symbol for a phototransistor

S604B PhotoTransistor
A phototransistor is a light-sensitive transistor. A common type of phototransistor, the bipolar phototransistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base-collector junction. It was invented by John N. Shive at Bell Labs in 1948[6]: 205  but it was not announced until 1950.[7] The electrons that are generated by photons in the base-collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes.[citation needed] Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Another type of phototransistor, the field-effect phototransistor (also known as photoFET), is a light-sensitive field-effect transistor. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.

A solaristor is a two-terminal gate-less phototransistor. A compact class of two-terminal phototransistors or solaristors have been demonstrated in 2018 by ICN2 researchers. The novel concept is a two-in-one power source plus transistor device that runs on solar energy by exploiting a memresistive effect in the flow of photogenerated carriers.[8]

Materials
Unwanted and wanted photodiode effects
edit
Any p-n junction, if illuminated, is potentially a photodiode. Semiconductor devices such as diodes, transistors and ICs contain p-n junctions, and will not function correctly if they are illuminated by unwanted light.[11][12] This is avoided by encapsulating devices in opaque housings. If these housings are not completely opaque to high-energy radiation (ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays), diodes, transistors and ICs can malfunction[13] due to induced photo-currents. Background radiation from the packaging is also significant.[14] Radiation hardening mitigates these effects.

In some cases, the effect is actually wanted, for example to use LEDs as light-sensitive devices (see LED as light sensor) or even for energy harvesting, then sometimes called light-emitting and light-absorbing diodes (LEADs).[15]

Photovoltaic mode (zero bias), photocurrent flows into the anode through a short circuit to the cathode.
"
⚠️
Suggestion
: Minor phrasing issue. "Through a short circuit" may be misread.
📌
Edit
:
"In photovoltaic mode (zero bias), the photocurrent flows from the anode to the cathode through an external short circuit."
"
The reverse bias also creates dark current without much change in the photocurrent.
"
✅
Suggestion
: The cause-effect isn't fully clear.
📌
Edit
:
"While reverse bias increases the dark current, it has little effect on the magnitude of the photocurrent."
"
While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes.
"
⚠️
Suggestion
: Missing comma and clarity issue.
📌
Edit
:
"Although phototransistors have higher responsivity, they do not detect low light levels better than photodiodes."
3. Awkward or Ambiguous Passages

⚠️
Issue
: Inconsistent singular/plural agreement.
📌
Edit
:
"A solaristor is a two-terminal gate-less phototransistor. A compact class of such solaristors was demonstrated in 2018..."
"
Radiation hardening mitigates these effects.
"
✅
Suggestion
: Clear, but perhaps a bit abrupt. Could be expanded for flow.
📌
Edit
:
"These effects can be mitigated through radiation hardening techniques, which improve device reliability in high-radiation environments."
Overall Suggestions
Consider
shortening
long sentences with multiple clauses.
Use consistent verb tenses (mostly present tense is appropriate in encyclopedia articles).
Avoid passive voice when unnecessary ("has been demonstrated" → "was demonstrated").
Consider
adding transition phrases
between some paragraphs for smoother flow, especially between operating modes.
Conclusion
The article is technically sound and mostly clear, but could benefit from minor refinements in phrasing, style, and sentence structure to improve clarity and flow. No spelling errors were found.

seperat*
→ "seperate", "seperation"
dependan*
→ captures UK-specific errors
ultraviole*
→ typo variants of "ultraviolet"
✍️ Want to Catch Awkward Phrasing?
Try searching for:
"due to the fact that"
→ can often be replaced with "because"
"in order to"
→ often just "to"
"utilize"
→ often overused; "use" is clearer
"based off of"
→ should be "based on"
"comprised of"
→ "composed of" or "consists of" is technically more correct

View history
Edit

More
The 5-HT3 antagonists, informally known as "setrons", are a class of drugs that act as receptor antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor, a subtype of serotonin receptor found in terminals of the vagus nerve and in certain areas of the brain. With the notable exceptions of alosetron and cilansetron, which are used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, all 5-HT3 antagonists are antiemetics, used in the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting. They are particularly effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer chemotherapy and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.[1]

The 5-HT3 antagonists may be identified by the suffix -setron,[2] and are classified under code A04AA of the WHO's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System.

Medical uses
edit
5-HT3 antagonists are most effective in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), especially that caused by highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin; when used for this purpose, they may be given alone or, more frequently, with a glucocorticoid, usually dexamethasone. They are usually given intravenously, shortly before administration of the chemotherapeutic agent,[3] although some authors have argued that oral administration may be preferred.[4] The concomitant administration of a NK1 receptor antagonist, such as aprepitant, significantly increases the efficacy of 5-HT3 antagonists in preventing both acute and delayed CINV.[5]

The 5-HT3 antagonists are also indicated in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), when needed, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Although they are more effective at controlling CINV—where they stop symptoms altogether in up to 70% of people, and reduce them in the remaining 30%—, they are just as effective as other agents for PONV.

Current evidence suggests that 5-HT3 antagonists are ineffective in controlling motion sickness.[6][7][8] A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ondansetron to treat motion sickness in air ambulance personnel showed subjective improvement, but it was not statistically significant.[9]

Available agents
edit
Ondansetron was the first 5-HT3 antagonist, developed by Glaxo around 1984. Its efficacy was first established in 1987, in animal models,[10][11] and it was extensively studied over the following years.[12] Ondansetron was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1991, and has since become available in several other countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, France and Brazil. As of 2008, ondansetron and granisetron are the only 5-HT3 antagonists available as a generic drug in the United States. Ondansetron may be given several times daily, depending on the severity of symptoms.
Tropisetron was also first described in 1984.[13] It is available in several countries, such as the UK, Australia and France, but not in the United States. The effects of tropisetron last up to 24 hours, so it only requires once-daily administration.
Granisetron was developed around 1988.[14] It is available in the U.S., UK, Australia and other countries. Clinical trials suggest that it is more effective than other 5-HT3 antagonists in preventing delayed CINV (nausea and vomiting that occur more than 24 hours after the first dose of chemotherapy).[15] It is taken once daily.
Dolasetron was first mentioned in the literature in 1989.[16] It is a prodrug, and most of its effects are due to its active metabolite, hydrodolasetron, which is formed in the liver by the enzyme carbonyl reductase. Dolasetron was approved by the FDA in 1997, and is also administered once daily.
Palonosetron is the newest 5-HT3 antagonist to become available in the U.S. market. It is an isoquinoline derivative, and is effective in preventing delayed CINV.[17] Palonosetron was approved by the FDA in 2003,[18] initially for intravenous use. An oral formulation was approved on August 22, 2008, for prevention of acute CINV alone, as a large clinical trial did not show oral administration to be as effective as IV use against delayed CINV.[19]
Ramosetron is only available in Japan and certain Southeast Asian countries as of 2008.[20] It has higher affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor than the older 5-HT3 antagonists, and maintains its effects over two days; it is therefore significantly more effective for delayed CINV.[21] In animal studies, ramosetron was also effective against irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms.[22]
Alosetron and cilansetron—the latter was developed by Solvay but never approved by the FDA —are not antiemetics; instead, they are indicated in the treatment of a subset of irritable bowel syndrome where diarrhea is the dominant symptom. Alosetron was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2000 due to unacceptably frequent severe side effects, including ischemic colitis, and is only available through a restrictive program to patients who meet certain requirements.[23]

Certain prokinetic drugs such as cisapride, renzapride and metoclopramide, although not 5-HT3 antagonists proper, possess some weak antagonist effect at the 5-HT3 receptor. Galanolactone, a diterpenoid found in ginger, is a 5-HT3 antagonist and is believed to at least partially mediate the anti-emetic activity of this plant.[24][25] Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant with 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonist effects that also possesses strong anti-emetic properties, however it is also very sedating. Studies show that Mirtazapine is as equally effective in treating chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting as standard treatments; it is also cheaper and has fewer side effects than typical anti-emetics, and its antidepressant qualities may be an added benefit for cancer populations.[26] Mirtazapine has also been used in the treatment of the motility disorder gastroparesis due to its anti-emetic effects.[27] Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic with anti-emetic properties similar to those of mirtazapine, also shows promise in treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.[26]

Adverse effects
edit
There are few side effects related to the use of 5-HT3 antagonists; the most common are constipation or diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.[28] Unlike antihistamines with antiemetic properties such as cyclizine, 5-HT3 antagonists do not produce sedation, nor do they cause extrapyramidal effects, as phenothiazines (such as prochlorperazine) sometimes do.

All 5-HT3 antagonists have been associated with asymptomatic electrocardiogram changes, such as prolongation of the PT and QTc intervals and certain arrhythmias.[28] The clinical significance of these side effects is unknown.

Pharmacology
edit
Mechanism of action
edit
The 5-HT3 receptors are present in several critical sites involved in emesis, including vagal afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT3 receptors. The highest concentration of 5-HT3 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) are found in the STN and chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), and 5-HT3 antagonists may also suppress vomiting and nausea by acting at these sites.[29] The 5-HT3 antagonists are greatly selective and have little affinity for other receptors, such as dopamine, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.[28]

Pharmacokinetics
edit
All 5-HT3 antagonists are well-absorbed and effective after oral administration,[4][28] and all are metabolized in the liver by various isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system. They do not, however, inhibit or induce these enzymes.[28]

Comparative pharmacology
edit
Despite that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists share their mechanism of action, they have different chemical structures and exhibit differences in affinity for the receptor, dose response and duration of effect. They are also metabolized in different ways, that is, different components of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system predominate in the metabolism of the antagonists.[30]

Because of this, patients who are resistant to one antagonist might benefit from another. A correlation exists between the number of active CYP 2D6 alleles and the number of vomiting episodes by patients who receive treatment with cisplatin and ondansetron or tropisetron. Patients with multiple alleles tend to be unresponsive to the antiemetic drug and vice versa.[31]

History
edit
The history of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists began in 1957, when John Gaddum and Zuleika P. Picarelli at the University of Edinburgh proposed the existence of two serotonin receptor subtypes, the M and D receptors (thus named because their function could be blocked by morphine and dibenzyline respectively).[33] The 5-HT3 receptor was later found to correspond to the M receptor.[34] In the 1970s, John Fozard found that metoclopramide and cocaine were weak antagonists at the 5-HT3 (5-HT-M) receptor. Fozard and Maurice Gittos later synthesized MDL 72222, the first potent and truly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.[35][36] The antiemetic effects of metoclopramide were found to be partially because of its serotonin antagonism.[30]

While Fozard was investigating cocaine analogues, researchers at Sandoz identified the potent, selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 from which the first marketed selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and granisetron were developed, and approved in 1991 and 1993 respectively.[35][37] Several compounds related to MDL 72222 were synthesized which eventually resulted in approval of tropisetron in 1994 and dolasetron in 1997.[37] A new and improved 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, named palonosetron, was approved in 2003.[37] The development of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists was a dramatic improvement in the treatment of nausea and vomiting.[30] Ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron and palonosetron are currently approved in the United States, and form the cornerstone of therapy for the control of acute emesis with chemotherapy agents with moderate to high emetogenic potential.[38]

Development
edit
5-HT3 receptor antagonists or serotonin antagonists were first introduced in the early 1990s, and they have become the most widely used antiemetic drugs in chemotherapy.[29] They have also been proven safe and effective for treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting.[30] Serotonin (5-HT) is found widely distributed throughout the gut and the central nervous system. In the gut, 5-HT is found mostly in mucosal enterochromaffin cells. Enterochromaffin cells are sensory transducers that release 5-HT to activate intrinsic (via 5-HT1P and 5-HT4 receptors) and extrinsic (via 5-HT3 receptors) primary afferent nerves.[39] Chemotherapeutic drugs for malignant disorders that cause vomiting have been found to cause release of large amounts of serotonin from enterochromaffin cells in the gut, serotonin acts on 5-HT3 receptors in the gut and brain stem.[39]

Abstract
The carpus (wrist) of birds has a complex evolutionary history, long known to involve carpal reduction and recently shown to include topological replacement of one carpal (the ulnare) by another (the pisiform)1. The pisiform plays a crucial role in stabilization of the distal wingtip during flight2, and facilitates kinematic integration that 'automates' wing motion3. The apparent absence of a pisiform in all but the earliest theropod dinosaurs led to the proposal that it was lost early in theropod evolution and regained only in birds as a key step in the origin of flight1. Here, we describe the forelimb skeletons of two newly prepared theropod dinosaur specimens from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, each of which preserves a pisiform, establishing its presence in Oviraptorosauria and Troodontidae in addition to birds. Reinterpretation of published material in light of these specimens shows a pisiform in a wide range of theropod species, including Microraptor4, Ambopteryx5 and Anchiornis6. Our results indicate that the pisiform replaced the ulnare by origin of the clade Pennaraptora, phylogenetically coincident with the hypothesized origin(s) of flight in birds and their closest relatives7,8. Taken together, our results indicate that replacement of the ulnare by the pisiform was a terminal step in assembly of the dinosaurian flight apparatus that occurred close to the origins of flight in theropod dinosaurs, rather than a novelty restricted to birds.

Relationship with the origin of flight
Our results make clear that the topological and functional replacement of the ulnare by the pisiform occurred much deeper in theropod history than has been previously understood and was a stepwise process involving the re-acquisition of an ossified pisiform in Maniraptoriformes, followed by its replacement of the ulnare in Pennaraptora. Over the past few decades, our knowledge of theropod dinosaur anatomy and evolution has increased exponentially, much of it showing that classically 'avian' traits such as thin-walled bones12, an enlarged brain10 and feathers47 all characterize more inclusive groups of theropod dinosaurs. Our results indicate that the construction of the avian wrist is no exception, and follows topological patterns laid down by the origin of Pennaraptora. It is significant that Pennaraptora boasts at least two independent origins of volant behaviour: one or more among feather-winged birdlike theropods, and one in the enigmatic membrane-winged scansoriopterygids, which are of uncertain phylogenetic position48, but are considered to represent a group capable of gliding flight49. Feather-winged pennaraptorans seem to have ancestrally possessed nine to eleven primary feathers (exclusively seen in flying birds today)8, and biomechanical analyses suggest that several were capable of powered flight7, but functionally asymmetrical primary feathers—which are strongly correlated with flight in extant birds—are at present not known outside Paraves8. It remains unclear whether Paraves experienced one or several origins of flight, but in any case the translocation of the pisiform closely precedes the several origins of flight in pennaraptoran theropod dinosaurs. Notably, the pennaraptoran lineages that lose the ossified pisiform tend to be large-bodied and/or flightless, although both Citipati and the unnamed troodontid IGM 100/3686 retain the pisiform at large body size. Anchiornithines have been repeatedly interpreted as secondarily flightless8,46, and show variation in the presence of a pisiform. Anchiornis itself has an ossified pisiform, but its close relative Eosinopteryx (which is characterized by reduced wing plumage and relatively shorter arms) seems to lack one. Intriguingly, Anchiornis has previously been interpreted as having equivocal flight capability on the basis of biomechanical modelling7, whereas Eosinopteryx has been consistently interpreted as a terrestrial animal50. Although flightless pennaraptorans do not always lack an ossified pisiform, we did not find a single potentially volant pennaraptoran that did lack one, corroborating our inference that the ossified, translocated pisiform is associated with flight.

Taken together, our results indicate that a key step in the assembly of the avian flight apparatus (translocation of the pisiform) occurred by the origin of the clade Pennaraptora, apparently closely preceding at least two separate origins of volant behaviour. Given that the pisiform of modern birds has several roles in forelimb kinematics that are suggested to be important to flight, it is worth briefly considering whether this evolutionary milestone could have facilitated experimentation with volant behaviour. One key role of the pisiform in modern birds is stabilization of the carpometacarpus, an action attributed to the presence of a large muscular process2 that is absent in the specimens described herein and all non-avialan theropods. We can thus exclude the hypothesis that establishment of a 'pisiform brace' was an innovation facilitating flight in non-avian pennaraptorans. It is possible that the pisiform of non-avian pennaraptorans enabled 'automated' flexion of the wrist and elbow as it does in modern birds, an action dependent upon both the position of the pisiform and ligamentous connections between it and the other carpals3. This mechanism probably operates during both flight and wing folding. However, it is unclear whether the requisite ligamentous connections would have necessarily appeared together with the migration of the pisiform itself, and indeed whether they are present in non-pennaraptorans with a plesiomorphic pisiform position. It is also possible that pisiform translocation is an epiphenomenon of the suite of anatomical changes to the forelimb occurring during coelurosaur evolution, or even represents a developmental response to embryonic motion associated with flapping behaviour. Data are at present insufficient to establish whether the translocation of the pisiform has a causal relationship with the origins of flight. However, the two new specimens reported herein do confirm that the presence of an ossified, translocated pisiform is not unique to avialans, and instead represents an evolutionary novelty that is closely phylogenetically correlated with the origins of flight in theropod dinosaurs. Future work integrating robustly supported pennaraptoran systematics, the evolution of feathers, and detailed anatomical and biomechanical study of the wing apparatus of birds and their closest relatives will be critical for establishing the functional significance of this evolutionary transformation, and to what degree avian flight and the extraordinary radiation of modern birds may have been, as the old saying goes, all in the wrist.

This is a superbly detailed and well-written scientific passage — and crucial to understanding the
evolutionary preconditions of flight
in theropod dinosaurs. There are
no spelling errors

Typos and grammatical slips
Phrasing awkwardness or ambiguity
Punctuation or structural improvements
Here's a breakdown of small issues and optional refinements:
✅
No Typos
Words like
"translocation," "volant," "plesiomorphic,"
and

are uncommon but
correctly spelled and contextually appropriate
.
🧹
Suggested Refinements (Optional)
Original
Suggested
Reason
"closely preceding at least two separate origins of volant behaviour"
"closely preceding at least two independent origins of volant behaviour"
"Independent" may be slightly clearer than "separate" for evolutionary origins.
"it is worth briefly considering whether this evolutionary milestone could have facilitated experimentation with volant behaviour"
[unchanged]
The phrase "facilitated experimentation" is figurative but acceptable in evo-devo; no change needed unless you want plainer wording.
"mechanism probably operates during both flight and wing folding"
"this mechanism likely operates during both flight and wing folding"
Optional: "likely" is more formal/scientific than "probably"
"epiphenomenon of the suite of anatomical changes to the forelimb"
"epiphenomenon of the broader suite of anatomical changes in the forelimb"
Adds slight clarity; optional
"equivocal flight capability"
"ambiguous flight capability"
"Equivocal" is precise in paleontological writing but may be swapped for general readability
"translocated pisiform is not unique to avialans"
"translocated pisiform is not exclusive to avialans"
Optional—"exclusive" might feel a touch smoother in flow
✏️ Minor Punctuation Observations
Comma before "although" in a complex sentence:
"...although both Citipati and the unnamed troodontid IGM 100/3686 retain the pisiform at large body size."
✅ Correct and standard. No change needed.
En dash in species IDs:
IGM 100/3686
✅ Looks good, assuming this is the format used in related literature.
Hyphenation of compound adjectives:
"...non-avian pennaraptorans..."
✅ Correct use of hyphen in "non-avian" and other compound modifiers.
🎯 Summary

Some optional stylistic refinements for clarity or tone.
The argumentation and structure are clear, detailed, and appropriately cautious (e.g., noting ambiguity around causality).
Would you like me to:

Perfect — here's a clear and concise
summary of the basic findings
from the article
"Reorganization of the theropod wrist preceded the origin of avian flight"
(Napoli et al.,
Nature
, July 2025):
🦴
Core Findings
Pisiform Bone Not Unique to Birds
The
pisiform
, a wrist bone crucial for modern bird flight, was long thought to have been lost in non-avian theropods and regained only in birds.
➤ New fossil evidence shows it was
present in multiple non-avian theropod groups
like
Oviraptorosaurs
,
Troodontids
, and
Microraptor
, proving it
persisted through theropod evolution
.
Replacement of the Ulnare by the Pisiform
The
pisiform replaced another wrist bone
, the
ulnare
, in a key group of theropods called
Pennaraptora
(includes birds and their closest dinosaur relatives).
➤ This bone swap likely occurred
before the origin of flight
and may have been essential in
preparing the wrist for aerial movement
.
Association with Flight Capability
All known
potentially flying pennaraptorans
(whether gliders or powered fliers) have an
ossified, translocated pisiform
.
➤
Flightless or large-bodied species
sometimes lost it — but no flying forms lack it, suggesting a
strong link between this bone and flight
.
Evolutionary Implications
The wrist reorganization wasn't a sudden innovation in birds but a
stepwise transformation
beginning in earlier theropods.
➤ This supports the idea that
avian flight evolved gradually
, using
pre-existing anatomical changes
.
✈️
Conclusion
The translocation of the pisiform was a
crucial structural innovation
that occurred
just before the evolution of flight
, and was likely
a precondition rather than a consequence
of avian flight. This finding reshapes our understanding of how birds got their wings — and confirms that, as the authors quip, it was indeed
"all in the wrist."

You said:
So it is arguing that wrist articulation preceded flight?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — exactly.
The article argues that
a key change in wrist articulation
— specifically, the
replacement of the ulnare bone by the pisiform
—
preceded
and may have
enabled
the evolution of flight in theropod dinosaurs.
More precisely:
This wrist reorganization occurred
in Pennaraptora
, a group that includes birds and their closest relatives.
The
ossified, translocated pisiform
provided
functional advantages
(like stabilizing and coordinating wing motion) that were
likely important for flight
.
These changes
happened before
the evolution of powered flight — suggesting that flight
built on pre-existing anatomical features
rather than requiring a fully novel wrist structure.
Key takeaway:
Yes — wrist reorganization came first, and likely set the stage for the multiple origins of flight in birdlike dinosaurs.
