Here's a
clean, corrected, and summarized version
of the key ideas in your document titled
"Complexity, Control Theory, and AI Alignment"
(Anders Sandberg, Thibault Voron, Ybars Koçoglu - Institute for Futures Studies, MIMIR Center, University of Maryland, College Park). It includes clarification of Forrest Landry's argument, the core control theory perspectives, toy models, and the implications for scalable oversight.
Complexity, Control Theory, and AI Alignment
1. Is AGI Intrinsically Unalignable?
The central question investigated is whether
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
is fundamentally unalignable due to the nature of control in complex systems.
Forrest Landry
argues that the
resources required for safe control scale worse than the complexity of the agent
, leading to a potential impossibility of robust AGI alignment. The project explores whether this argument can be formalized and whether there are tractable ways to approximate or bound control in practice.
2. Theoretical Foundations
Control Theory in Complex Systems
Controllability
refers to the controller's ability to steer a system toward desired outcomes via inputs.
In complex systems (especially AI), controllability depends on:
Knowledge of the
controller
about the
agent
The
complexity
of the world and the environment
The
action space
and internal variability of the agent
Feedback and observability
Landry's Argument (Summarized)
The
control burden
increases
faster than the complexity
of the system.
In the limit, any AGI capable of real-world reasoning may require
complete internal modeling
for safety, which is
computationally intractable
.
Even
small errors
in modeling or control can lead to
catastrophic misalignment
due to "hashiness" (see below).
Therefore,
scalable oversight
mechanisms must be developed
prior
to reaching AGI-level capability.
3. Toy Models for Exploring Controllability
These are simplified environments to test the feasibility of alignment and oversight:
Tic-Tac-Toe with an adversarial agent
: Explore limits of enforceable fairness or non-deception.
LLM (Large Language Model) moderation games
: A controller tries to shape dialogue or constrain outcomes.
Harsh environments with arbitrary rules
: Tests robustness of control under unmodeled edge cases.
Multi-agent information exchanges
: Agent A must interact correctly with agent B under the controller's oversight.
These toy models help trace the spectrum from
fully controllable
to
intrinsically uncontrollable
systems.
4. Tractability of Safety Functions and Logical Oversight
Control can be formalized via
safety functions
: Given input
x
x
x
, output
y
y
y
, the function returns whether the pair is
safe
.
The tractability of evaluating these safety functions is
nontrivial
.
For some logical functions, evaluating safety is
NP-hard
or
undecidable
.
Even
non-adversarial
systems may have
hidden unsafe attractors
in their behavior space.
This leads to the insight that
tractable safety evaluation
(especially under worst-case adversarial assumptions) may be
impossible
for general systems.
5. Hashiness and Fragility
Hashiness
refers to the idea that
small input differences
lead to
large output divergences
.
In AI alignment, this implies:
Tiny variations in control signals or oversight may cause
entirely different behaviors
.
Safety becomes
brittle
, since evaluating the outcome space requires
complete and precise knowledge
.
This property undermines the reliability of intuitive control or light-touch oversight.
6. Research Directions
A. Scaling Laws and Phase Transitions
How do alignment strategies behave as we
scale up agent complexity
?
Are there
phase transitions
in controllability (i.e., a point beyond which safe control becomes infeasible)?
Can these transitions be characterized by analogues to
Lyapunov exponents
,
eigenvalue dynamics
, or
entropy measures
?
B. Statistical and Singular Learning Theory
Investigate how
learning algorithms
and
generalization bounds
interact with control.
Study the interplay between
singular models
,
dynamical systems
, and
alignment
.
Examine whether
gradient-based optimization
fundamentally limits safe oversight.
C. Cryptographic Analogy
Is it possible to build
provably safe systems
akin to
zero-knowledge proofs
or
obfuscation protocols
?
Can we design controllers that can enforce safety
without needing internal access
to the AGI?
7. Conclusion and Implications
There may be
fundamental limits
to aligning general-purpose AGI, grounded in control theory, complexity theory, and logical intractability.
Forrest Landry's insight is not merely a philosophical position but may have
formalizable backing
via control-theoretic and computational bounds.
Developing
tractable, scalable oversight mechanisms
—potentially involving toy models, cryptographic controls, or new training paradigms—remains essential before AGI becomes a reality.
References and Terminology (Selected)
Hashiness
: A property of functions where small input changes cause large, unpredictable output shifts.
Safety function
: A binary-valued function evaluating the acceptability of a given input-output behavior.

Abstract
This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of controlling collective behavior in complex systems comprising large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents. Building upon traditional control theory's foundation in individual systems, we introduce tools designed to address the unique challenges of coordinating networks that exhibit emergent phenomena, including consensus, synchronization, and pattern formation. We analyze how local agent interactions generate macroscopic behaviors and investigate the fundamental role of network topology in determining system dynamics. Inspired by natural systems, we emphasize control strategies that achieve global coordination through localized interventions while considering practical implementation challenges. The chapter concludes by presenting novel frameworks for managing very large agent ensembles and leveraging interacting networks for control purposes.

Keywords: Complex systems; Networks; Large-scale systems; Multi-agent systems; Network controllability; Network control; Node control; Pinning control; Adaptive control; Edge control; Structural control; Stability.

Key points:

• The most common formalism to model complex systems is that of a graph—where vertices represent agents and edges represent the interaction between them—with agent dynamics modeled via ordinary differential equations.
• Controlling complex systems typically means enforcing a specific collective behavior, ranging from consensus and synchronization to pattern formation and herding.
• Control strategies for complex systems can be either centralized or distributed, and can often be categorized as either node control, edge control, or structural control.
• Tools for establishing stability and convergence of control strategies include Lyapunov theory, contraction theory, and the master stability function approach.

Synthesis: Control Theory for Complex Systems and Its Relevance to AI Alignment
Overview of the Chapter
In
Controlling Complex Systems
(Coraggio et al., 2025), the authors provide a rigorous examination of how to steer large ensembles of interacting dynamical agents—systems that range from physical robots and biological swarms to neural and social networks. The formalism they use centers around:
Graphs
: Nodes are agents, edges are their interactions.
Dynamical Systems
: Each agent follows ODE-based dynamics.
Emergent Behavior
: Collective phenomena like consensus, synchronization, or pattern formation emerge from local rules.
They emphasize
localized interventions
to achieve
global control goals
, a crucial paradigm in both biological systems and engineered networks.
Key Control Strategies in Complex Systems
Strategy
Description
Node Control
Control input is applied to specific agents.
Edge Control
Modulates the interactions (edges) between agents.
Structural Control
Alters the network's topology to achieve desired control properties.
Pinning Control
Only a subset of nodes is directly controlled, which then influence the rest.
Adaptive Control
Dynamically adjusts control parameters based on feedback.
Stability tools
like
Lyapunov theory
,
contraction theory
, and
master stability functions
are used to prove convergence to desired behaviors.
Relevance to AI Alignment and Landry's Argument
Aspect from Coraggio et al. (2025)
Alignment Analogue in AGI Control
Networked agents with local interactions
Submodules or subsystems in an AGI model
Emergent macroscopic behaviors (e.g., consensus)
Emergent AGI goals or policies from inner loops and heuristics
Localized interventions to control global behavior
Oversight or guardrails via interpretable subnetworks
Pinning control of key nodes
Direct control of high-leverage latent variables in AI models
Structural and edge control
Altering architectural coupling or loss surfaces
This framing is
critically important
because it supports a
middle path
between:
Full
micro-control
(which Forrest Landry argues becomes intractable),
And complete
laissez-faire generality
(which risks misalignment).
Instead,
graph-structured interventions
(node/edge/pinning control) allow
scalable
influence
without full access to internal representations
—a realistic route for AGI oversight.
Application: Scalable Oversight via Network Control Theory
Coraggio et al.'s tools imply the possibility of developing
robust oversight mechanisms
that:
Target
key nodes
in the AI's cognitive graph (e.g., value-alignment neurons, planning modules).
Use
edge modulation
(e.g., regularizers that weaken risky internal interactions).
Exploit
natural modularity
or sparse control theory (e.g., identifying dominant subnetworks).
Guarantee
emergent alignment behaviors
through
global Lyapunov functions
or
contracting metrics
.
These match well with the challenge of
constraining AI behavior without full interpretability
, and complement recent proposals like
mechanistic interpretability
,
circuit auditing
, and
modular policy shaping
.
Conclusion: Toward Practical Controllability of AGI
Combining Forrest Landry's
caution
about complexity scaling with Coraggio et al.'s
graph-based control framework
, we find a fertile middle ground for:
Modeling
AGI systems
as
dynamical networks
.
Applying
pinning or edge-based controls
for
alignment-compatible behavior
.
Using
mathematical stability tools
(Lyapunov, contraction theory) to
formalize safety envelopes
.
Next steps for alignment research
might include:
Building
graph-theoretic abstractions
of AI architectures.
Identifying
high-leverage control points
in models like transformers.
Exploring
emergent property guarantees
from
local interventions

1Introduction and Motivation  
Modern technological advances have fundamentally changed our perspective on feedback control. While classical control theory has primarily focused on regulating individual dynamical systems, contemporary challenges increasingly involve coordinating and controlling large groups of interconnected systems. From power distribution in smart grids to autonomous vehicle formations, from biological cell networks to social systems, we encounter scenarios where multiple agents must coordinate their behavior to achieve common objectives (Newman et al. 2006, Strogatz 2001).  
  
Systems comprising multiple interacting units possess a distinctive characteristic that distinguishes them from traditional dynamical systems: they exhibit emergent collective behaviors that cannot be easily derived from the analysis of individual components. These systems, known as complex systems, represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of dynamics. This concept emerged in the 1940s (Weaver 1948), and while its precise definition remains debated without complete consensus, scholars broadly agree that collective behavior arising from local interactions represents the fundamental characteristic of such systems (Vicsek 2002, Ladyman et al. 2013, Torres et al. 2021, Bianconi et al. 2023, Estrada 2024). Moreover, the concept of interactions leading to emergent behavior is fundamentally linked to feedback in control theory (Åström & Murray 2021). Indeed, complex systems can be viewed as networks of numerous feedback loops, their degree of complexity determined by both the number and intricacy of these interconnections. These systems are inherently multi-scale, as microscopic interactions between agents generate macroscopic collective behaviors observable at the population level.  
  
The simplest example of such collective behavior is consensus, where all agents converge to a common equilibrium state (Olfati-Saber et al. 2007). A more general phenomenon, often observed in both natural and engineered systems, is synchronization, where an ensemble of interconnected nonlinear agents converges towards the same time-varying trajectory (Pikovsky et al. 2001). Beyond these fundamental phenomena, collective behavior manifests in diverse forms including pattern formation, platooning, and clustering.  
  
The development of effective strategies for controlling collective behavior of complex multi-agent systems has become increasingly critical in addressing contemporary challenges. These include the transformation of traditional power systems into smart grids and energy communities (Dobson 2013, Doerfler et al. 2013), the engineering of resilient and sustainable supply chains (Hearnshaw & Wilson 2013), the implementation of smart sensorized cities (Wang, Jiang, Zhang, Quek, Ren & Hanzo 2017) and transportation networks (Alam et al. 2015), the advancement of synthetic biological control systems (Del Vecchio et al. 2018), and the evolution of coordinated swarm robotic systems (Annaswamy et al. 2023).  
  
The collective behavior emerging from large ensembles of interacting dynamical systems is strongly influenced by the structure of the interaction network among its constitutive agents (Liu & Barabási 2016). These networks typically diverge from simple regular lattices (Newman 2003, 2018), exhibiting intricate topological features that profoundly shape system behavior. The interactions between agents further complicate the dynamics, as they can be time-varying, intermittent, subject to delays, or governed by nonlinear functions (Cortés 2006, Meng et al. 2018, Almeida et al. 2017).  
  
Natural systems provide compelling examples of efficient control strategies. Biological systems, in particular, demonstrate how global coordination can emerge through the influence of a remarkably small number of agents (Chen et al. 2014). This principle of achieving global control through localized actions on select agents holds profound implications for technological applications. However, its implementation requires addressing fundamental questions: how to achieve and maintain desired collective behaviors using only local information, how to identify which agents to control and with what intensity, and how to formally demonstrate convergence to desired behaviors. Building on these foundational challenges, many pressing applications, such as search and rescue operations (Queralta et al. 2020) or traffic control (Siri et al. 2021), require a group of controller agents to work together effectively in order to shape the behavior of a separate group of target agents. Recent research has focused on this idea of harnessing complex systems for control, emphasizing both the design of the controller populations and the specific conditions needed to successfully coordinate the target behaviors; a notable example is that of shepherding problems as discussed in Lama & di Bernardo (2024).  
  
Refer to caption  
Figure 1:Fundamental Elements of a Complex System. a. Macroscopic description of a complex system. Here, the identity of the agents composing the network is lost in favor of a description of the behavior that emerges at a system level. b. Microscopic description of a complex system. The key elements are the agents of the network and their interaction protocols (left panel), and the network describing the interconnections between agents (right panel).  
Practical implementation must address several critical challenges that arise in real-world applications. Heterogeneity among agents presents a fundamental difficulty, particularly in biological applications where identical components are rare (Del Vecchio et al. 2018). This is compounded by communication constraints and the reality of only having access to partial information about the system state (Hespanha et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2020). Environmental disturbances and measurement noise further complicate the control problem, while the dynamic nature of many networks leads to time-varying topologies and interaction patterns that must be handled robustly. These practical considerations represent significant hurdles that must be overcome to translate theoretical control strategies into effective real-world solutions.  
  
An emerging frontier is the development of strategies for systems comprising an extremely large number of agents. In such scenarios, the classical description of complex systems, which specifies the dynamics and interactions of each individual agent, becomes both analytically and computationally intractable. This has led to the development of new frameworks that address these systems directly at the population level through continuum descriptions (Nikitin et al. 2021).  
  
This chapter presents a systematic exploration of the problem of controlling complex network systems. While the field is vast and rapidly evolving, we focus on control strategies that are general in their formulation and can be proved formally to converge. For broader perspectives on specific applications and alternative approaches, readers are referred to comprehensive reviews in both control theory and physics literature (Liu & Barabási 2016, Meyn 2007, Su & Wang 2013, D'Souza et al. 2023). The subsequent sections develop these concepts systematically, moving from basic modeling frameworks to advanced control strategies. We examine both theoretical foundations and practical implementations, with particular attention to emerging applications and future challenges in this exciting field.  
  
2Modeling Complex Systems  
Understanding and controlling complex systems requires a systematic modeling framework for the latter. A complex system can be understood as being the ensemble of units (the atomic entities in the system) and the interactions between them. The units are often called systems, nodes, or agents, while the the interactions are also referred to as communication, (inter-)connections and links. Mathematically, a complex system can be modeled through three fundamental components (see Figure 1): (i) the dynamics of the agents, (ii) the structure of their interconnections, and (iii) their interaction protocols. This description enables capturing both the microscopic behavior of individual agents and the emergence of macroscopic collective phenomena exhibited at a network level. We expound each of the three components below.  
  
2.1Agent Dynamics  
In most control problems, it is assumed that each agent has a state that can change in time (see Figure 1b, right panel). Several mathematical formalisms are used to describe such dynamics, including (ordinary, delay, stochastic, and partial) differential equations, difference equations, Markov decision processes, and probability density/mass functions; yet, the most common formalism is arguably that of ordinary differential equations. In that case, each agent is described as a nonlinear affine dynamical system, i.e.,

n  
×  
m  
 describes how the agent responds to interaction, and   
N  
∈  
ℕ  
 is the number of agents in the network.  
  
The choice of the agent dynamics   
f  
i  
 depends heavily on the application, with the complexity of the mathematical model varying according to the specific context. In the simplest case, agents can be modeled as simple or higher-order integrators (Ren & Beard 2008). However, often more sophisticated models are required to capture the key dynamical features of the system. For example, autonomous vehicle applications generally involve second-order motion dynamics to capture both position and velocity states (Ye & Yamamoto 2018); in power systems, agents are represented by nonlinear oscillators describing power generators that must maintain synchronization (Hill & Chen 2006); on the other hand, biological networks present arguably one of the most challenging scenarios, where agents represent complex nonlinear and stochastic cellular processes with intricate interaction patterns. Examples of applications modeled via different frameworks include gene regulatory networks, often described using Markov chains or stochastic differential equations (Gillespie 2000), systems of faults, modeled via discontinuous dynamical systems (Burridge & Knopoff 1967) and communication networks, typically represented through difference equations (Zhu & Martínez 2010). The choice of appropriate agent dynamics modeling is context-dependent and must strike a good trade-off between model fidelity and analytical tractability.  
  
2.2Network Structure  
The second essential component of a complex system is the network structure, which describes the interconnections between agents. Most commonly, interactions are assumed to be pair-wise, i.e., each one involving exactly two agents. In this case, the structure is represented by a graph (Godsil & Royle 2013), say   
𝒢  
=  
(  
𝒱  
,  
ℰ  
)  
, where   
𝒱  
=  
{  
1  
,  
...  
,  
N  
}  
 is the set of vertices (the agents), and   
ℰ  
⊆  
𝒱  
×  
𝒱  
 is the set of edges (the interconnections), see Figure 1b, left panel. Here we assumed an undirected graph (the presence of a connection from agent   
i  
 to   
j  
 also implies a connection from   
j  
 to   
i  
), but directed graphs are also common; in weighted graphs—as opposed to the unweighted ones assumed here—each edge also has a scalar value associated to it, typically representing a meaningful quantity in the application of interest (importance, capacity, travel time, etc.).  
  
Graphs can be represented algebraically through two matrices. The first one is the adjacency matrix   
A  
∈  
{  
0  
,  
1  
}  
N  
×  
N  
, with   
A  
i  
⁢  
j  
=  
1  
 if an edge from   
i  
 to   
j  
 is present and   
0  
 otherwise. Note that different authors can adopt different conventions on whether such edge means that agent   
i  
 influences   
j  
 or that   
i  
 is influenced by   
j  
. The second matrix is the graph Laplacian matrix   
L

ℤ

N

 is the degree matrix, which is diagonal and with

 equaling the degree of node   
i  
, i.e., the number of connections involving agent

 (Newman 2018). Network graphs can also be characterized macroscopically via a wide variety of descriptors, such as the average degree, the clustering coefficient, path lengths, diameter, different node centrality measures and community structure; for detailed descriptions, see Boccaletti et al. (2006), Newman (2018).  
  
Elementary well-known graphs typically used for model validation include paths, rings, stars, wheels, complete, and   
k  
-nearest neighbors (Godsil & Royle 2013). On the other hand, it has been found that in applications certain kinds of structures tend to appear more consistently. These include random graphs (built via the Erdős-Rényi model (Erdős & Rényi 1959)), lattices, that can be drawn as regular tilings, small-world networks, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths (Wieland et al. 2011), scale-free networks exhibiting power-law degree distributions (Watts & Strogatz 1998, Liu & Barabási 2016), and hierarchical or modular structures (Ravasz et al. 2002).  
  
In the recent years, two more advanced modeling frameworks gained traction: multilayer networks, and networks with higher-order interactions. In multilayer networks, multiple graphs are used to describe the network; connections between agents in different graphs are possible, and if the vertices sets are the same for all graphs, the network is said to be multiplex (Bianconi 2018). This formalism is used for example to describe multimodal transportation networks, where each mode of transportation (e.g., buses, subway, taxis) is modeled via a different graph, or social networks where each platform (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X) is a graph, and more (Boccaletti et al. 2014). Networks with interactions that involve more than two agents (higher order interactions) are formalized via hypergraphs. These networks model, for instance, scientific authorship and biological processes Boccaletti et al. (2023). Special cases of hypergraphs are simplicial complexes, where the presence of a connection between a certain number of agents implies the presence of all possible connections between any proper subset of these agents.  
  
2.3Interaction Protocols  
The third key element is the protocol through which agents exchange information and influence each other over existing connections (see Figure 1b, right panel). Assuming pair-wise (unweighted) interactions, a common mathematical description for the interaction term   
v  
i  
 in (1) is

 represents the coupling (or interaction) strength (or gain),

)  
:  
ℝ

→  
ℝ

 describes the interaction protocol.  
  
The interaction protocol is diffusive if it can be written as   
h  
⁢  
(  
x  
j  
−  
x  
i  
)  
. In particular, a simple and common choice for   
h  
 is a linear diffusive coupling, i.e.,   
h  
⁢  
(  
x  
i  
,  
x  
j  
)  
=  
x  
j  
−  
x  
i  
. However, real systems often exhibit more complex interaction patterns that go well beyond simple linear protocols. Time delays inevitably arise in communication or actuation (Hespanha et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2020), while coupling strengths between agents are rarely uniform, requiring heterogeneous gains (  
σ  
i  
⁢  
j  
 instead of a single   
σ  
) to accurately represent the varying connection strengths [e.g., Simpson-Porco et al. (2013)]. Also, the interaction strengths can evolve dynamically based on the states of the connected nodes through adaptive coupling laws (DeLellis, di Bernardo & Garofalo 2009). Further complexity arises from intermittent or switching interactions, where connections between agents may be temporarily lost or deliberately modified, or instantaneously commutating between different values (Yang et al. 2016, Coraggio et al. 2018). These realistic features must be carefully considered when designing control strategies for practical applications.  
  
2.4Simplified Network Model  
While real systems exhibit considerable complexity, analysis often begins with simplifying assumptions. These typically include (i) considering identical agents (  
f  
i  
=  
f  
j  
=  
f  
,   
∀  
i  
,

) , (ii) unitary response to interaction (  
G  
i  
=

∀

), (iii) static pair-wise interactions, and (iv) a linear diffusive coupling protocol (

,  
x  
j  
)  
=  
x  
j  
−

). Under these assumptions, the network dynamics can be written compactly as

3Controlling Complex Systems  
3.1Control Goals  
When controlling a complex system, we typically wish to enforce convergence (Pavlov et al. 2004) of the agents' states to a specific collective behavior. One of the simplest ones is consensus, where all agents converge to the same constant state (Olfati-Saber et al. 2007); this can be desired in rendez-vous problems of mobile agents, sensor fusion problems, and can occur in opinion dynamics networks (Amirkhani & Barshooi 2022). Synchronization is arguably the most studied collective behavior and possibly the first being investigated, with Christiaan Huygens writing in 1673 about an "odd kind of sympathy" when he observed in the behavior of coupled pendulum clocks. A synchronized complex system is one where all agents' states converge to the same solution, which can also be a non-constant function of time (Pikovsky et al. 2001, Arenas et al. 2008, Boccaletti et al. 2018). In power grids, synchronization of the derivatives of power angles associated to generators is a crucial requirement for correct operation (Dörfler & Bullo 2014). In the brain, moderate levels of neural synchronization can be desired, as it is linked to motor coordination, whereas excessive levels of synchronization are related to seizures (Popovych & Tass 2014). To fit application needs, numerous particularizations of synchronization exist, including synchronization behavior that is bounded (or practical) (Vasca et al. 2021), partial (or output) (Chopra 2012), clusterized (Lu et al. 2010), and of the type observed in chimera states (Abrams & Strogatz 2004)  
  
When agents' states have meaning akin to positions, velocities, and orientation, control goals related to spacial positioning are common. For instance, aggregation (or cohesion) tasks require agents to move as close as possible to one another (Gazi & Passino 2003), and when they move with similar velocity vector, they are said to flock (Olfati-Saber 2006). In formation control, each agent must achieve a unique position relative to others (Oh et al. 2015, Bayındır 2016), whereas geometric pattern formation aims to position the agents according to a structured arrangement, such as a tessellation of space (Giusti et al. 2023). Finally, more complex behaviors find application in domains such as search and rescue or crowd control. Examples include foraging and area coverage (Queralta et al. 2020), or herding, where only a subset of units can be controlled, and the goal is to influence the movement of the rest of the agents towards a desired one (Long et al. 2020).  
  
In containment or confinement problems, typical of epidemics or flow network applications, the agents' states must remain confined in certain regions of the network's state space (Della Rossa, Salzano, Di Meglio, De Lellis, Coraggio, Calabrese, Guarino, Cardona-Rivera, De Lellis, Liuzza, Lo Iudice, Russo & di Bernardo 2020); similar problems are sometimes framed as safety problems in robotics (Wang, Ames & Egerstedt 2017). Finally, many decision-making problems over networks systems involve some form of optimization (e.g., power dispatch in power grids, traffic light control in road networks), although the agents are not always assumed to have a dynamics; we refer to Thai & Pardalos (2012), Nedić & Liu (2018) for more detailed discussions.  
  
Refer to caption

Schematic description of an edge control strategy. This paradigm revolves around modifying the interaction protocol or coupling strength of a fraction of the edges of the network. c. Schematic description of a structural control strategy. Here, the controllers orchestrate the collective behavior of the complex system by dynamically modifying the structure of the interaction network.  
3.2Control Approaches for Complex Systems  
The control of complex systems introduces distinct challenges that demand approaches fundamentally different from classical control theory. Instead of regulating a single system, we must shape the collective behavior of numerous interconnected agents through strategic interventions. This presents an inherently multiscale control problem: localized actions at the microscopic level of individual agents must propagate through the network to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes in the collective behavior.

A fundamental classification in network control strategies distinguishes between centralized and decentralized/distributed approaches. Centralized control strategies, illustrated in Figure 2a, rely on a single computing entity that determines control actions across the entire network, even when multiple actuation points are distributed among nodes. In contrast, decentralized/distributed control strategies employ multiple decision-makers operating with limited or local information, as shown in Figure 2b. While this approach introduces additional constraints in control design, it offers enhanced robustness and reliability.1  
  
Additionally, three distinct approaches characterize the control of complex systems: node control (Figure 3a), which directly influences the dynamics of selected agents at the microscopic level; edge control (Figure 3b), which modifies the interaction protocols between agents; and structural control (Figure 3c), which dynamically alters the network topology to shape macroscopic behavior (D'Souza et al. 2023). While each approach has its merits, combining these strategies can often yield more effective solutions by operating simultaneously across multiple scales (DeLellis et al. 2010). Indeed, modern applications, e.g., large-scale complex systems of mobile agents, are driving the development of new frameworks for controlling complex systems, such as that of continuification (see Figure 4a) (Nikitin et al. 2021, Maffettone, Boldini, di Bernardo & Porfiri 2023). Similarly, scenarios in which a group of controlled agents must cooperatively influence the behavior of a separate group—increasingly more common in applications like crowd and traffic management, or the confinement of pollutants—inspired the idea of harnessing complex systems for control (see Figure 4b), as we will discuss below.  
  
Refer to caption  
Figure 4:Advanced control paradigms. a. Schematic representation of a continuification based architecture to control a large-scale complex system. In this strategy a continuum model of the complex system is used to devise a macroscopic control law that is then discretized and applied to the agents of the network. b. Graphical description of a strategy that harnesses complex systems for control. Here, a network of controller agents, through local interactions, shapes the emergent behavior exhibited by a second network of controlled agents.  
3.3Pinning Control: Learning from Nature  
Nature demonstrates how complex systems can achieve efficient control through localized interventions. Two examples illustrate this principle: in cardiac tissue, a relatively small population of pacemaker cells orchestrates the synchronized beating of the entire heart through local signal propagation; in honeybee swarms, a minority of scout bees guides the entire colony to new nesting sites through distributed communication protocols (Chen et al. 2014). These natural examples inspired the development of pinning control (Wang & Chen 2002), where macroscopic behavior is influenced by controlling a small fraction of nodes. The key insight is that network interconnections can propagate the influence of controlled nodes throughout the system, making it possible to achieve global coordination through local interventions on a limited number of agents.  
  
This approach can be mathematically described as follows. Consider a network of identical nonlinear systems described by equation (3). The pinning control strategy introduces one or more additional nodes, the leaders or pinner nodes, dividing the network into two communities: nodes directly controlled by the leaders (say   
M  
 nodes) and uncontrolled nodes (numbering   
N  
−  
M  
). Typically,   
M  
≪  
N  
 (control can often be achieved with just 10-20% of nodes being influenced by the pinner nodes). The controlled nodes evolve according to

Proposed strategies include adaptive pinning control (Guo et al. 2021, Turci et al. 2014), optimal control (Della Rossa et al. 2023), approaches based on reinforcement learning (Rahnama & Antsaklis 2019) and more, generally inspired from nonlinear control strategies.  
  
3.4Controllability and Observability of Complex Systems  
A fundamental question emerging from the framework of pinning control is: how many and which nodes should be controlled to ensure the control action steers the system towards the desired behavior? This problem, highlighted in the seminal work of Liu et al. (2011) for the case of linear agent dynamics, has revealed surprising insights. Contrary to intuition, only a small fraction of nodes typically needs to be controlled, and control often avoids hubs, favoring nodes with fewer connections, while the network structure significantly influences control effectiveness.  
  
These counterintuitive findings highlight the importance of analytical frameworks to understand and predict under which conditions it is possible to control a network towards the desired trajectory. To address this challenge, researchers have developed two main approaches for analyzing network controllability. The first employs graph-theoretic methods that focus on identifying structural properties that guarantee controllability (Mesbahi & Egerstedt 2010, Liu et al. 2011, Yuan et al. 2013), with extensions that are suitable for undirected and weighted graphs (Yuan et al. 2013), provide less conservative results on the number of agents to control (Gao et al. 2014), provide information on the amount of energy required to solve a control problem (Yan et al. 2012), and balance the number of nodes to be controlled with the required control energy (Pasqualetti et al. 2014). The second approach is based on the master stability function, which analyzes the conditions for the local stability of desired states, as discussed for instance in Sorrentino et al. (2007). The dual problem of controllability, that is observability, has also been tackled for complex systems, showing that it is indeed possible to observe the state of a complex system by measuring just part of the agents' states (Liu et al. 2013).  
  
3.5Advanced Node Control Strategies  
Beyond basic pinning control, several more sophisticated approaches have emerged to address the complexities of real-world networks. Adaptive control strategies automatically adjust control gains to respond to changing conditions (Das & Lewis 2010), while robust control methods handle uncertainties and disturbances inherent in complex systems (Modares et al. 2019). For networks with time-varying topologies, switched or impulsive control approaches provide frameworks for maintaining performance despite structural changes, and hybrid control strategies combine continuous and discrete dynamics to handle delays and mixed-mode behaviors (Zhao et al. 2009, Yang et al. 2011, Zhou et al. 2012). Recent research has emphasized crucial practical considerations, including the impact of nonlinear node dynamics (Jiang & Lai 2019) and the development of frameworks for scenarios that involve constrained node selection (DeLellis et al. 2018). Modern control architectures have become increasingly sophisticated, solving network optimization problems online (Coraggio et al. 2022), or incorporating multilayer and multiplex control strategies, enhancing performance through the interaction of multiple control layers with different topologies (Burbano-Lombana & di Bernardo 2016). Other advanced methods span synchronization control (Scardovi et al. 2010), cooperative control (Seyboth et al. 2016), and distributed control approaches (Liuzza et al. 2016), with particular attention to practical stability (Montenbruck et al. 2015) and finite-time control objectives (Yang & Lu 2015).  
  
Additionally, recent node control techniques are increasingly leveraging data-driven methods, employing system identification for network dynamics, machine learning for control policy design, and adaptive learning-based strategies (Baggio et al. 2021, Asikis et al. 2022, D'Souza et al. 2023, Wu et al. 2024). A large and growing area of study is that of the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning, which applies principles of reinforcement learning (most often, temporal-difference approaches to solve optimal control problems) to complex networks, modeled as stochastic games. These approaches promise to solve very complicated control problem via machine learning, and have had remarkable success in teaching agents how to play competitive games (Vinyals et al. 2019, OpenAI et al. 2019), how to play hide-and-seek in teams (Baker et al. 2020), and how to practice boxing (Won et al. 2021). However, strong theoretical (and often computational) limitations persist, induced by nonstationarity of the agents' control policies, partial observability, and credit assignment. We refer to Busoniu et al. (2008), Nguyen et al. (2020) for more a detailed description.  
  
3.6Edge Control  
Real-world complex systems rarely conform to simplified assumptions of identical agents, uniform coupling strengths, and static topologies. Operating in environments characterized by noise, disturbances, and time-varying conditions, these systems have driven the development of increasingly sophisticated modeling and control frameworks. Specifically, the development of frameworks to describe time varying networks has put the basis for the development of strategies that aim to coordinate the behavior of the system by modifying the interaction protocols and/or the structure of the network. Among the landmark developments that allowed the theoretical understanding of dynamic networks, there is Siljak's pioneering work in the 1970s (Siljak 1978, 2008), which first formalized systems with dynamical nodes and edges, though maintaining fixed structure (Zecevic & Siljak 2010).  
  
A crucial advancement has been the development of adaptive coupling strengths. While maintaining a fixed network structure, edges become dynamical elements whose strengths evolve based on the states of connected nodes:

 follow appropriate adaptation laws (DeLellis, di Bernardo & Garofalo 2009, Lu et al. 2006, Yu et al. 2012, Das & Lewis 2010, Kim & De Persis 2017). This adaptive approach enables automatic tuning of coupling strengths, compensates for heterogeneities, enhances synchronization properties, and improves robustness to disturbances. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that adaptive strategies can bridge one of the crucial gaps between microscopic and macroscopic control. As shown in Kempton et al. (2017a, b), distributed estimation and adaptation mechanisms can control macroscopic network properties through targeted actions on individual edges.  
  
To compensate for heterogeneity and discontinuity in agent dynamics, discontinuous and set-valued coupling have effectively been used to enforce synchronization (Coraggio et al. 2021, 2020, Miranda-Villatoro 2024). Integral coupling protocols have also proved effective in the control of heterogeneous agents (Burbano-Lombana & di Bernardo 2015). Finally, impulsive coupling protocols have been used synchronize agents subject to delays (Yang et al. 2016).  
  
3.7Structural Control  
Holland's introduction of complex adaptive systems (Holland 1975) expanded the vision of adaptive edge weights to encompass systems that modify both their structure and their dynamics in response to environmental changes. More recent frameworks of adaptive networks (Gross & Sayama 2009) and evolving dynamical networks (Gorochowski et al. 2010) provide comprehensive treatments of systems with dynamic topologies and adaptive behaviors. Edge-snapping control (DeLellis, di Bernardo, Garofalo & Porfiri 2009) represents a sophisticated approach, enabling networks to dynamically rewire themselves. Edge dynamics follows that of a nonlinear bistable system:

 measures node state mismatch, and   
d  
 controls transient behavior. This framework enables dynamic creation and removal of connections, self-organization of network structure, and adaptation to changing conditions.  
  
Implementation of these advanced strategies faces several practical challenges. These include managing computational complexity of network evolution, meeting communication requirements for distributed adaptation, analyzing stability of time-varying structures (Zhao et al. 2009), ensuring robustness to noise and disturbances, and maintaining scalability to large networks. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new theoretical frameworks and practical applications emerging regularly; further notable examples of networks with time-varying structure include switched systems, networks with proximity graphs, and activity-driven networks (Ghosh et al. 2022).  
  
A complementary perspective to structure control is structure design, where rather than changing the structure online, an optimal one is designed a priori, which can be the only option available for costly infrastructure such as road networks or power grids. As a matter of fact, the propensity of a complex system to display a certain collective behavior is heavily influenced by its structure, as captured by metrics such as the eigenratio, the algebraic connectivity and the minimum density (Donetti et al. 2005, DeLellis et al. 2011, Coraggio et al. 2021). Both model-based (Fazlyab et al. 2017) and data-based (Coraggio & di Bernardo 2024) approaches exist to carry out optimal structure design; however, the main challenge stems from the fact that different control goals can require completely different structure solutions and even design algorithms.  
  
3.8Control of Large-Scale Systems  
In many real-world applications, the number of agents in the network can become very large2 (e.g., crowds, traffic or biological networks), with thousands of interacting agents. As the network size increases, the microscopic description of agent dynamics and interactions becomes both analytically and numerically challenging. In recent years, a technique known as continuification has been developed as a promising solution to this problem (Nikitin et al. 2021). The basic idea is to transform microscopic, agent-level dynamics into a macroscopic continuum description using partial differential equations (PDEs), design the control action at the macroscopic level, and then discretize it for application to the microscopic agents. This approach facilitates the synthesis of control actions aimed at achieving desired global configurations while implementing controls at the local, individual-agent level. Continuification methods are particularly useful in systems with large numbers of agents because they enable effective control over emergent collective behavior, thereby reducing the overall complexity of the control problem. Applications include swarm robotics (Maffettone, Boldini, di Bernardo & Porfiri 2023, Rubenstein et al. 2014, Gardi et al. 2022), traffic systems (Siri et al. 2021), biological cell populations (de Cesare et al. 2022), and crowd dynamics (Albi et al. 2020).  
  
Several contemporary approaches use macroscopic representations of multi-agent dynamics. Mean-field control techniques (Elamvazhuthi et al. 2021, Borzì & Grüne 2020) approximate the behavior of large agent ensembles by focusing on the mean interaction across the system, while graphon-based methods (Jordan 2013) use continuum limits of large networks to enable scalable control strategies.  
  
The continuification approach can be formalized as follows. Consider a system of   
N  
 agents, each characterized by a position   
x  
i  
⁢  
(  
t  
)

Additionally, the description of the network as a set of partial differential equations paves the way for the extension of tools coming from the PDE control control literature (Krstic & Smyshlyaev 2008) for the control of large-scale complex systems.

This is a
high-level, comprehensive overview of modern strategies for controlling complex dynamical networks
, suitable for an academic review or technical textbook. Here's a
structured summary and interpretive commentary
that highlights the core ideas, organizing the material by theme and drawing out key conceptual and mathematical points:
Summary and Commentary: Control Strategies for Complex Dynamical Networks
1. Centralized vs. Decentralized Control (Figure 2)
Centralized control
uses a single controller with global network knowledge, ensuring coherent behavior but suffering from scalability and robustness limitations.
Decentralized or distributed control
distributes decision-making among local agents with partial information. This tradeoff introduces design challenges but improves robustness, scalability, and fault tolerance—critical for real-world systems.
Interpretation:
This dichotomy echoes the shift in modern control architectures from top-down supervision to emergent coordination, aligning with nature-inspired principles (e.g., swarms, neuronal systems).
2. Node, Edge, and Structural Control (Figure 3)
Node control
directly adjusts the dynamics of selected agents.
Edge control
manipulates the coupling between agents—e.g., tuning interaction strengths.
Structural control
modifies network topology itself, allowing for large-scale changes in emergent behavior.
Key insight:
Multiscale control benefits from the combination of these approaches, particularly when local interventions can propagate or restructure influence across the network.
3. Continuification and Harnessing Complex Systems (Figure 4)
Continuification
replaces a microscopic agent-based model with a macroscopic continuum model (e.g., PDEs), enabling more tractable control at scale.
Harnessing control
flips the paradigm: a complex network (e.g., swarm of controller agents) is itself used as a control mechanism for another network.
Insight:
This reframes control not just as an external intervention but as a dynamic property of the system—a major theme in biologically inspired and emergent control theory.
4. Pinning Control
Inspired by nature (e.g., pacemaker cells, scout bees),
pinning control
applies input to a small subset of agents to control the global network.
Equations (4) and (5)
show how controlled nodes differ from passive ones, with control actions often based on
state feedback
toward a reference trajectory.
The proportion of pinned nodes (often 10-20%) can suffice for global synchronization.
Insight:
This method leverages the
topological spread
of influence, capitalizing on network interconnectivity to minimize intervention cost.
5. Controllability and Observability
Foundational questions:
How many nodes must be controlled?
Which nodes should be controlled?
Surprising finding (Liu et al. 2011):
high-degree hubs are not necessarily optimal control points
—often, nodes with low degree offer more leverage due to structural controllability.
Two main approaches:
Graph-theoretic
methods
Master stability function
analysis
Observability mirrors controllability—global state can often be inferred by measuring a subset of agents.
Implication:
Structural insight is vital; naive intuitions about hubs and connectivity can mislead control design.
6. Advanced Node Control
Includes:
Adaptive control
(real-time gain tuning)
Robust/hybrid control
(handling nonlinearities, time-varying topology)
Machine learning-based control
, especially:
Multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL)
System identification and policy optimization
Challenges:
Nonstationarity, partial observability, credit assignment, and convergence in high-dimensional state spaces.
Emerging trend:
Data-driven, model-free control strategies are powerful but currently fragile—particularly in dynamic or uncertain environments.
7. Edge Control
Edge weights become
adaptive
variables that evolve based on local dynamics, enabling:
Synchronization enhancement
Robustness to heterogeneity
Bridging micro- and macro-control scales
Equation (6)
introduces time-varying coupling, regulated by adaptation laws.
Strategies include:
Discontinuous, integral, and impulsive couplings
Set-valued mappings
for heterogeneous agents
Key takeaway:
Treating interactions (edges) as dynamic agents opens new frontiers for subtle and effective control, particularly in cooperative or noisy systems.
8. Structural Control
Goes beyond edge weights to dynamically
rewire network topology
.
Example:
Edge-snapping control
, governed by bistable potential dynamics (
Equation (7)
), enables connection creation/destruction.
Complement: Structure Design
, optimizing the network
a priori
for specific control goals (e.g., maximize algebraic connectivity, minimize energy cost).
Challenge:
The search space of topologies is enormous and nonconvex, requiring heuristic or learning-based design strategies.
9. Control of Large-Scale Systems via Continuification
Microscopic agent model
(Equation 8): local pairwise interactions + control input.
Continuum PDE model
(Equation 9): density evolution via conservation laws.
Applications:
Swarm robotics
Traffic
Crowd dynamics
Biological populations
Continuification
simplifies control law design and enables analytical convergence guarantees using PDE control theory.
Interpretation:
Continuification formalizes the idea that "the crowd is the controller"—global patterns emerge from local flows, and manipulating density fields can shape system-wide outcomes.
Concluding Remarks
Across all these sections, the unifying insight is that
control in complex systems is not about brute-force intervention
, but about
leveraging structure, interdependence, and emergence
. Whether through pinning a few nodes, tuning edge weights, or shaping global density flows, modern control theory for networks is moving toward
light-touch, structure-aware, scalable architectures
.
The field is poised at a convergence point: theory (graph dynamics, PDEs, stability), computation (machine learning, optimization), and application (robot swarms, infrastructure, biology) are all aligning to support
distributed, adaptive, and intelligent control
.

3.9Harnessing Complex Systems for Control
All the solutions presented until now focus on designing external controllers to influence networked systems. An alternative and powerful approach involves harnessing one complex system to control another. In this framework, a group of controller agents is responsible for controlling another population of uncontrolled target agents. A paradigmatic example of this is the shepherding problem, where a group of agents (herders) must coordinate to control the collective dynamics of another group (targets). This scenario appears naturally in biological systems, such as dolphins hunting fish (Haque et al. 2009) or ants collecting aphids, and has important applications in technological domains including search and rescue operations, crowd control, and environmental cleanup.

In its essence, this control framework revolves around designing 
M
 controllers tasked with coordinating the behavior of 
N
 targets. In general, denoting with 
x
t
,
i

i

(11)
where

 is the interaction protocol between the controllers, and

 describes the control input. Different control solutions have been proposed for this control problem, ranging from heuristic rules (Lama & di Bernardo 2024, Nalepka et al. 2019) to optimal control solutions (Escobedo et al. 2016). This framework has several important implications for the design of multi-agent control systems. It provides guidelines for determining the minimum number of control agents needed (Lama & di Bernardo 2024), clarifies the relationship between local interactions and global control objectives, and offers insights into how system performance scales with the number of agents (Maffettone et al. 2024). These findings are particularly relevant for large-scale distributed systems where centralized control is impractical or impossible.

Several open challenges remain in harnessing complex systems for control. These include developing continuum models to describe emergent shepherding behavior, engineering local interaction rules for more complex tasks, addressing scenarios with actively escaping targets, and extending the framework to three-dimensional spaces and other geometries.

4Proving Stability
The paramount property of a feedback controller is its ability to ensure that the controlled system converges to desired behavior and maintains it despite disturbances. Formally, this normally means that a specific region in the state space of the network is made invariant and asymptotically stable (Meiss 2017). Thus, it is fundamental to establish in which conditions controlled complex networks are stable. Multiple theoretical frameworks have emerged to address this challenge, each offering distinct insights and capabilities while complementing the others.

4.1Global Stability through Lyapunov Theory
Lyapunov-based methods offer powerful analytical tools to prove local or global stability of invariant solutions (DeLellis et al. 2011). The approach centers on constructing suitable candidate Lyapunov functions (Khalil 2002). These are scalar functions 
V
:
ℝ
N
⁢
n
→
ℝ
 that are continuous and differentiable, and positive everywhere but in the desired state 
x
∗
. Then, to ensure that the trajectories of the system converge to the desired one, it is necessary to establish conditions so that

V
˙
⁢
(
x
)
<
0
,
∀
x
≠
x
∗
.
(12)
Numerous extensions to this theory exist, to prove convergence to invariant sets that are not points, with non-autonomous systems, etc. (Khalil 2002); when inputs must directly be taken into account, passivity theory can be employed (Arcak 2007). The main difficulty associated with Lyapunov based methods is finding a suitable function 
V
. While these methods can handle nonlinear vector fields and provide global results, they often require additional conditions to impose some regularity on the dynamics, such as the one-sided Lipschitz (or QUAD) condition (and its extensions) (Bullo 2024, Coraggio 2020), and the resulting stability criteria can be conservative. Nevertheless, their analytical nature makes them particularly valuable for theoretical analysis.

4.2Dynamical Analysis through Contraction Theory
Contraction theory (Lohmiller & Slotine 1998, Slotine et al. 2004, Bullo 2024) offers a powerful alternative focusing on the convergence of trajectories through analysis of the differential dynamics

˙
⁢

,
t
)
. The theory shows that if there exists a matrix measure (also known as logarithmic norm) (Söderlind 2006) of 
J
 that is negative, then all trajectories converge toward each other (incremental stability). This approach proves particularly effective for certain system classes, especially biological networks (Russo & Slotine 2010, Russo et al. 2010), offering several advantages. First, it provides a natural framework for synchronization analysis, directly addressing the convergence of trajectories rather than stability of particular solutions (which need not be known a priori) (Russo et al. 2013). Second, it allows the use of different matrix measures, providing flexibility in analyzing various types of systems. Finally, it readily handles time-varying dynamics, making it suitable for adaptive and evolving networks.

4.3Local Stability in Synchronization Problems: The Master Stability Function
When the desired emergent behavior is the synchronization of all the agents onto the same trajectory, the master stability function (MSF) approach, pioneered by Pecora & Carrol (1998) [see also Fujisaka & Yamada (1983)], provides a powerful framework for analyzing local stability. The method proceeds through systematic reduction of the high-dimensional stability problem to a parametric analysis of individual modes. Namely, linearization of equations (1)-(2) about the synchronous solution

This approach elegantly combines network structural properties (through the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix) with node dynamics, providing explicit conditions on coupling strength required for synchronization. While semi-analytical in nature, requiring numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents, it enables systematic classification of synchronizability for different network topologies. Recent extensions extended the use of the master stability function to study synchronization of piecewise-smooth systems (Dieci & Elia 2023) and the transitions from cluster to full synchronization (Bayani et al. 2024).

4.4Unified Understanding through Comparative Analysis
These approaches complement each other in several key aspects. In terms of scope, the MSF provides detailed local stability conditions, and tend to be less conservative and more flexible with respect to different interaction protocols, while Lyapunov methods and contraction theory can provide also global results, but tend to be more conservative, especially depending on which Lyapunov function or contraction norm are selected. Computationally, the approaches differ significantly: the MSF requires numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents, Lyapunov methods often yield analytical results but require appropriate selection of a valid Lyapunov function, and contraction theory enables a hybrid approach combining analytical insights with numerical verification. Each method also shows distinct strengths in different applications: the MSF excels for networks of identical nodes, Lyapunov methods handle heterogeneous systems well, and contraction theory proves particularly effective for certain dynamical structures common in biological and physical systems.

Recent developments have significantly expanded these foundational approaches. Unified frameworks now combine different methodologies (Khong et al. 2016), while extensions address time-varying networks (Wieland et al. 2011) and nonlinear systems (Andrieu et al. 2018). New methods for analyzing partial and cluster synchronization have emerged, broadening the scope of application (Zhang et al. 2021, Della Rossa, Pecora, Blaha, Shirin, Klickstein & Sorrentino 2020). However, several fundamental challenges persist. The analysis of heterogeneous networks remains difficult, particularly when considering convergence in adaptive and evolving networks. Understanding the impact of noise and uncertainties, developing scalable methods for large networks, and establishing tight bounds on convergence rates represent ongoing challenges. A comprehensive treatment of these developments and challenges can be found in di Bernardo et al. (2016).

5Summary and Future Directions
Complex systems in modern applications are characterized by three fundamental components: node dynamics describing individual agent behavior, interaction functions governing inter-agent influences, and network structure defining interconnection topology. These systems exhibit remarkable emergent properties, with synchronization representing the most extensively studied collective behavior. Control strategies have evolved along three complementary paths: direct influence on selected agents through node control, modification of interaction dynamics via edge control, and dynamic rewiring of network topology through structural control. Recent advances have expanded these approaches to address large-scale systems and harness complex networks for control purposes.

Despite significant progress, multiple challenges persist. Heterogeneity presents a fundamental obstacle, particularly in biological systems where network components vary significantly. Time-varying structures in robotics and modern power grids demand novel theoretical frameworks. Practical implementation must address noise, uncertainties, and communication complexities, including intermittent connections, limited range, and packet drops. The theoretical framework must expand to encompass heterogeneous stochastic systems, strongly nonlinear or hybrid agents, and the role of noise in control (Russo & Shorten 2018, Burbano-Lombana et al. 2017).

The field is advancing toward sophisticated paradigms emphasizing self-organization through adaptive network structures, interacting complex systems, and distributed decision-making. Bio-inspired strategies derive crucial insights from natural systems—from fish schools performing coordinated maneuvers to bird flocks maintaining formations and social insect colonies exhibiting collective intelligence. Advanced control architectures increasingly incorporate hybrid strategies, multi-layer structures, and adaptive, learning-based approaches. Furthermore, compact descriptions of emergent behavior in large-scale networks have established foundations for applying PDE control to complex systems.

Applications span diverse emerging fields. In biology, these range from cell colony coordination to tissue engineering and synthetic biology. Robotics applications encompass swarm systems, microrobot collectives, and autonomous vehicle formations. Infrastructure benefits through applications in smart power grids, transportation networks, and communication systems.

Future research focuses on developing control strategies with enhanced capabilities: self-organization and adaptation to changing conditions, robust operation in uncertain environments, efficient scaling to large networks, effective function with limited communication, and achievement of complex collective behaviors. This represents a fundamental shift in complex system management. This field continues to expand control theory's frontiers, offering opportunities for both fundamental research and practical applications. Success will enable new technologies in swarm robotics, biological engineering, and fields where coordinated collective behavior is essential. As we uncover principles governing complex collective behavior, we approach control systems matching the sophistication of natural systems, opening possibilities from medicine to robotics where numerous units must coordinate to achieve common objectives.
