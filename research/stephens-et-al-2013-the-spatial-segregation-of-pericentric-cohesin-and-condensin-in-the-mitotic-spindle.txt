ABSTRACT  In mitosis, the pericentromere is organized into a spring composed of cohesin, 
condensin, and a rosette of intramolecular chromatin loops. Cohesin and condensin are en­
riched in the pericentromere, with spatially distinct patterns of localization. Using model 
convolution of computer simulations, we deduce the mechanistic consequences of their spa­
tial segregation. Condensin lies proximal to the spindle axis, whereas cohesin is radially dis­
placed from condensin and the interpolar microtubules. The histone deacetylase Sir2 is re­
sponsible for the axial position of condensin, while the radial displacement of chromatin 
loops dictates the position of cohesin. The heterogeneity in distribution of condensin is most 
accurately modeled by clusters along the spindle axis. In contrast, cohesin is evenly distrib­
uted (barrel of 500-nm width × 550-nm length). Models of cohesin gradients that decay from 
the centromere or sister cohesin axis, as previously suggested, do not match experimental 
images. The fine structures of cohesin and condensin deduced with subpixel localization ac­
curacy reveal critical features of how these complexes mold pericentric chromatin into a 
functional spring.
INTRODUCTION
The mitotic spindle apparatus is composed of chromatin and micro­
tubules that function together to accurately segregate the dupli­
cated genome. Sister chromatids are bioriented in the spindle when 
they attach to the spindle microtubules from opposite spindle poles 
via the kinetochore. The centromere is the designated kinetochore 
attachment site of the chromatin and resides at the apex of an intra­
molecular pericentromere loop (Yeh et al., 2008) that comes under 
tension upon biorientation. This intramolecular loop, along with co­
hesin and condensin, constitutes the chromatin spring that resists 
the outward force of the spindle microtubules (Stephens et  al., 
2011). While the geometric structure of the mitotic spindle microtu­
bules has been well studied, the fine structure of the chromatin 
spring has yet to be determined.
Electron microscopy (EM) studies performed in yeast reveal that 
16 cylindrically arranged kinetochore microtubules, with a diameter 
of 250 nm, and four interpolar microtubules emanate from each 
spindle pole body (Winey et al., 1995; O'Toole et al., 1999). The 
32 kinetochores from 16 sister chromatids cluster into two foci upon 
biorientation in metaphase (Goshima and Yanagida, 2000; Pearson 
et al., 2004). Previous work has used model convolution to under­
stand the dynamics of kinetochore microtubules and kinetochore 
clustering using yeast. Computer simulations of spindle microtubules 
or kinetochore microtubule plus ends were convolved using the ex­
perimental objective point spread function (PSF) and compared with 
experimental data (Sprague et  al., 2003; Gardner et  al., 2005; 
Pearson et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2013). Model convolution pro­
vides subpixel accuracy in predicting the position of fluorescently 
labeled proteins (Gardner et al., 2010). These studies were essential 
in determining the basic parameters that lead to mechanistic under­
standing of kinetochore microtubule plus-end positioning and clus­
tering in the yeast mitotic spindle.
Cohesin and condensin are essential structural maintenance 
of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes enriched in the peri­
centromere chromatin (Blat and Kleckner, 1999; Megee et  al., 
1999; Tanaka et al., 1999; Hagstrom et al., 2002; Wang et al., 
2005). Both cohesin and condensin are necessary for the

(Spc29-RFP). Metaphase spindles with lengths of 1.3-1.7 μm and 
both poles in the same image plane were aligned horizontally and 
analyzed for fluorescence distribution perpendicular to the spindle 
axis. Line scans drawn through the brightest pixel revealed that ki­
netochore microtubule tufts labeled with Tub1-GFP have a Gaussian 
distribution with a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 264 ± 16 nm 
(n = 47). Kinetochore microtubule plus-end clusters labeled with the 
kinetochore protein Nuf2-GFP also had a Gaussian distribution with 
a FWHM of 291 ± 14 nm (n = 21; Haase et al., 2012). The increase in 
fluorescence width perpendicular to the spindle axis is consistent 
with flaring of the kinetochore microtubule plus ends (Winey et al., 
1995).
Cylinders of different sizes representing the distribution of each 
of these components were populated with fluorophores and con­
volved with the experimental objective PSF (Sprague et al., 2003; 
Quammen et al., 2008). Simulated fluorescence images were ana­
lyzed in the same manner as experimental images and then com­
pared using a normalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to 
determine the best match (see Materials and Methods). A spindle 
the size and shape of reconstructed spindles from EM and tomo­
graphic approaches was simulated (Figure 1A). The simulated 
spindle is 1.5 μm in length with two cylinders, representing the 
16 kinetochore microtubules (250 nm in diameter and 350 nm in 
length) emanating from the spindle poles. The overlap region of 
the interpolar microtubules spans the distance between kineto­
chore microtubule bundles and is represented by a cylinder 800 nm 
in length and 130 nm in diameter (Winey et al., 1995; Gardner 
et al., 2008). Perpendicular line scans through the simulated kine­
tochore microtubule tufts were indistinguishable from the experi­
mental images (MLE = 0.21, Gaussian FWHM of 263 ± 2 nm, 
n = 100 simulated vs. 264 nm experimental; Figure 1A). The plus 
ends of the kinetochore microtubules were simulated as cylinders 
confinement/compaction of the pericentromere loop and spin­
dle-length regulation (Stephens et  al., 2011). However, green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins of these complexes re­
side in nonoverlapping positions in the pericentromere 
(Bachellier-Bassi et al., 2008; Stephens et al., 2011). Cohesin is 
radially displaced from the spindle microtubules in a cylindrical 
arrangement, while condensin lies proximal to the mitotic spin­
dle and clusters of sister kinetochores. The distribution of peri­
centric LacO spots 6.8 kb from the centromere display a broad 
bilobed distribution around the spindle axis that is coincident in 
width with the cohesin barrel (Anderson et al., 2009; Stephens 
et al., 2011; Haase et al., 2012). The distribution of fluorescently 
tagged cohesin and condensin allows us to examine the struc­
ture of the mitotic pericentromere spring.
In this study, we utilize model convolution to determine the fine 
structure of pericentric cohesin and condensin in the metaphase 
spindle. Cohesin is best matched as a random distribution of single 
complexes confined to a hollow cylinder (500 nm in diameter) 
surrounding the interpolar spindle microtubules. Condensin is best 
fitted as clustered complexes that lie along the spindle axis. The 
nonoverlapping position of these complexes provides mechanistic 
insights into the function of the chromatin spring and how it contrib­
utes to force balance in the segregation apparatus.
RESULTS
Model convolution of spindle microtubules 
and kinetochores in mitosis
To demonstrate that model convolution can be used to determine 
the size of structures in the mitotic spindle, we compared experi­
mentally obtained images of GFP-tagged proteins with simulations. 
Images of Tub1-GFP (spindle microtubules) and Nuf2-GFP (kineto­
chores) were acquired in cells marked with spindle pole bodies 
FIGURE 1:  The geometry of spindle components. (A) Experimental images of spindle microtubules (Tub1-GFP) were 
compared with simulations. Modeled spindle microtubules measured 1.5 μm in length, with two bundles of kinetochore 
microtubules 350 nm in length and 250 nm in diameter and interpolar microtubules spanning the interkinetochore 
distance (800 nm) and 130 nm in diameter (Winey et al., 1995; Gardner et al., 2008). (B) Experimental images of 
kinetochore clusters (Nuf2-GFP) were compared with simulations. The plus ends of the kinetochore microtubules 
were simulated as hollow cylinders 300 nm in outer diameter. (C) Pericentric condensin (Smc4-GFP) is best modeled 
as a hollow cylinder with an outer diameter of 350 nm and spanning the length of the pericentric chromatin. 
(D and E) Pericentric cohesin (Smc3-GFP) is best modeled as a hollow cylinder with a 500-nm mean diameter with 
a depicted thickness of 50 nm. The radial distance between cylinders containing cohesin and condensin is ∼75 nm.

300 nm × 130 nm × 200 nm (outer diameter, inner diameter, 
length). The hollow center accounts for the interpolar microtubules 
that exclude kinetochore microtubules. Line scans produced a 
Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 291 ± 3 nm (n = 100 simu­
lated), matching experimental images of kinetochore clusters 
(MLE = 0.90, 291 nm experimental; Figure 1B). The simulation of 
input geometries accurately recapitulates the dimensions of kine­
tochore microtubules and kinetochore microtubule plus ends.
Geometric modeling of cohesin and condensin 
within the spindle
Experimental images of cohesin (Smc3-GFP) consistently display a 
bilobed distribution when viewed in sagittal section of metaphase 
cells (Yeh et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2011; Haase 
et al., 2012; Figure 1D, and see Figure 3C later in the paper). Line 
scans perpendicular to the spindle axis yield two peaks of intensity 
corresponding to the bilobed organization (Figures 1D and 2). The 
inclusive peak-to-peak measure in sagittal section was 373 ± 63 nm 
(n = 48 experimental Smc3-GFP; Figure 1D). The cohesin barrel can 
also be measured in transverse images that give a larger peak-
to-peak distance of 475 ± 62 nm (n = 51 experimental; Figure 1E). 
Cohesin barrel length viewed in sagittal section was measured using 
the distance between the half-maximum intensity from line scans 
taken parallel to the spindle axis. The cohesin barrel is 560 ± 118 nm 
in length (n = 33 experimental; Figure 1D).
For modeling the size and appearance of the cohesin barrel, 
isotropic cylinders were simulated with diameters increasing by 
25-nm steps (Table 1). Experimental images of cohesin most closely 
resemble a simulated cylinder with a central diameter of 500 nm 
and length of 550 nm. Side-on (sagittal) images yield a peak-to-
peak measurement 362 ± 31 nm (n = 50 simulated) compared with 
373 nm (MLE = 0.99; Figure 1D and Table 1). End-on (transverse) 
images yield a peak-to-peak measurement of 487 ± 28 nm (n = 
50 simulated) compared with 475 nm (MLE = 0.96; Figure 1E and 
Table 1). Simulations of a cylinder 550 nm in length yielded a half-
maximum intensity distance of 559 ± 18 nm (n = 20 simulated) 
compared with 560 nm (MLE = 0.40; Figure 1D). The cohesin barrel 
length (550 nm) is shorter than the interkinetochore distance in 
metaphase cells (∼800 nm; Bouck and Bloom, 2007; Stephens 
et al., 2011).
The simulation allows us to gain insight into differences in experi­
mental observations obtained from different perspectives of the 
same structure. When taking an in-focus section through the mid­
plane of the cylinder in sagittal section, there are out-of-focus fluo­
rophores at different positions along the z-axis that contribute to the 
fluorescence (Figure 2B, side, green haze). Due to the lack of resolu­
tion along the z-axis these out-of-focus fluorophores contribute to 
the in-focus sagittal image. The result is an underestimate of the 
dimensions of the cylinder walls that translates into a decrease in 
distance between the two actual peaks (Figure 2, A, C, and D). In 
contrast, in the transverse view, out-of-focus fluorophores are all

distance measurement making the measurement smaller. In contrast, 
out-of-focus fluorescence for the 90° tilted image (transverse/end on) 
is aligned with the in-focus fluorescence, resulting in a more accurate 
measurement of barrel width. (C) Simulated images of side (left) and

maximum likelihood reflects the highly variable and heterogeneous 
experimental condensin fluorescence from cell to cell, which is not 
seen in cohesin. Best-fit cylinders of cohesin and condensin distribu­
tions are displaced by a radial distance of ∼75 nm ([500-nm cohesin 
radius − 350-nm condensin radius]/2).
Modeling of homogeneous versus heterogeneous 
fluorophore distributions
Unlike cohesin, condensin appears heterogeneous. In approxi­
mately equal frequency, a single focus, two foci, or line distribu­
tion of Smc4-GFP is observed between the kinetochores (Figure 
3B, experimental; Stephens et  al., 2011). Heterogeneity may 
be caused by either a low number of molecules or clustering of 
molecules so that the structure is not completely filled (Figure 3A). 
To determine whether the heterogeneity in condensin is a result of 
fewer molecules than cohesin, we quantified the number of Smc4-
GFP molecules in the pericentromere calibrated to a cluster of 
Cse4-GFP. Condensin had a 3 ± 1 ratio (n = 12) to Cse4-GFP, com­
parable to cohesin's 3.3 ± 1.2 ratio (Yeh et al., 2008). The number 
of Cse4 molecules in a kinetochore cluster in yeast was recently 
calibrated to 79 ± 17 molecules (Lawrimore et al., 2011). The total 
number of cohesin or condensin molecules in the pericentromere 
is between 237 and 266 molecules, ∼8 molecules per pericen­
tromere (n = 32). Thus condensin heterogeneity versus cohesin 
homogeneity is not due to a difference in protein number in the 
pericentromere.
In simulations, we can cluster fluorophores, thus decreasing the 
number of unique fluorophore positions in the structure (Figure 
3A). To determine whether condensin heterogeneity is the result 
of clustering, we simulated increasing levels of clustering and 
compared the results with experimental data. Cylinders randomly 
filled with the measured number of fluorophores (240) as single or 
paired appear uniform. Clustering fluorophores into groups of 
eight or 16 results in heterogeneity that matches experimental 
data (n = 100, χ2 = 0.37 and 0.97, respectively; Figure 3B). Bio­
chemical and theoretical studies indicate that condensin functions 
cooperatively (Melby et al., 1998; Strick et al., 2004; Alipour and 
Marko, 2012), providing a possible explanation for clustering and 
aligned in x,y with in-focus fluorophores (Figure 2B, end on, no 
green haze). Therefore the transverse measurement is a more 
accurate reflection of the actual dimensions of the cohesin barrel 
(475-nm experimental transverse measure, 500 nm modeled; 
Figure 2, A and D).
To further investigate sources of error, we compared experimen­
tal and simulated images with various degrees of tilt. As the barrel is 
tilted from the sagittal to transverse, peak-to-peak measure will in­
crease as less out-of-focus fluorophores contribute to the line scan 
(Figure 2B, dotted line). Experimental sagittal peak-to-peak dis­
tances were analyzed only in images in which both spindle poles 
were in focus in the same z-plane to minimize the effects of tilt. 
Images with increased tilt due to spindle poles being in different 
z planes were found to have larger peak-to-peak distances 
(393 ± 54 nm for 300-nm spindle tilt in z, n = 14; 435 ± 54 nm for 
600-nm spindle tilt in z, n = 12; see Figure 2A, blue). Similarly, simu­
lations of increasing tilt from sagittal view in 15° increments result in 
increasing peak-to-peak distances culminating with transverse, 
90° tilt (n = 50 each, simulations). Simulation of tilting cylinders ac­
curately recapitulates the experimental increases in peak-to-peak 
distance from tilt. The inability to achieve matching values for simu­
lated cylinders in sagittal and transverse sections is likely due to an 
average experimental tilt of ∼15° (Figure 2A).
We can estimate the thickness of the barrel wall in simulation and 
compare it with experimental measurements. In transverse images, 
the dip in fluorescence is directly related to the thickness of the co­
hesin barrel (denoted transverse dip; Figure 2D). A smaller percent­
age of maximum intensity reveals a thinner cohesin barrel (1 nm-
150 nm equals 44-56% of maximum intensity; Table 2). Experimental 
fluorescence dipped to 32 ± 14% of maximum intensity. Simulations 
of the cohesin barrel with thickness of 1 nm or 50 nm were within the 
experimentally obtained range (44-47% of maximum intensity; 
Table 2). This suggests that the cohesin barrel is approximately the 
thickness of a single cohesin ring, ∼40 nm in diameter (Anderson 
et al., 2002; Haering et al., 2002; Gruber et al., 2003; Surcel et al., 
2008).
Condensin lies proximal to the spindle microtubules and spans 
the distance between kinetochores (Stephens et  al., 2011). Line 
scans taken perpendicular to the spindle axis reveal condensin 
fluorescence is a Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 323 ± 53 nm 
(n = 42 experimental Smc4-GFP; Figure 1C). Condensin does not 
display a bilobed appearance in WT cells (n = 42). To estimate the 
diameter of condensin, we generated isotropic cylinders and in­
creased the outer diameter in increments of 25 nm. The cylinder was 
given an inner diameter of 130 nm to account for the interpolar mi­
crotubules that exclude chromatin from the axis (Winey et al., 1995). 
Experimental average size of condensin was best matched by a cyl­
inder with an outer diameter of 350 nm (n = 100 simulated, Gaussian 
distribution with a FWHM of 324 ± 4 nm compared with 323 nm 
experimental, MLE = 0.11; Figure 1C and Table 3). The low

Modeling pericentric cohesin and condensin  |  3913 
of cohesin fluorophores (240) throughout the structure (n = 100, 
χ2 = 0.70; Figure 3C). Thus heterogeneity is consistent with bio­
chemical clustering of condensin, while homogeneity indicates 
little or no clustering of cohesin.
Cohesin is distributed throughout the pericentromere, 
100 nm from the centromere
Herein we will consider three possible gradient models of cohesin 
in the pericentromere that could give rise to the experimentally 
measured fluorescence distribution along the spindle axis (Figure 
4A). Cohesin is known to load at the centromere (Blat and Kleckner, 
1999; Megee et al., 1999; Tanaka et al., 1999) and migrate from 
loading sites (Glynn et al., 2004; Lengronne et al., 2004; D'Ambrosio 
et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2011). Disruption of cohesin's ATPase activity 
(Smc1E1158Q or Smc3E1155Q; Hu et al., 2011) results in pericen­
tric cohesin accumulating at the centromere cluster. This evidence 
led Hu et al. (2011) to propose a model in which cohesin loads at 
the kinetochore/centromere, entraps the DNA in an ATP-depen­
dent process, and migrates from the centromere to the pericen­
tric chromatin. This model predicts that pericentric cohesin would 
be distributed in a gradient that decays from the centromere. To 
determine the location of the kinetochore/centromere, we plot­
ted the position of the centromere clusters (Cse4-GFP) relative to 
a normalized spindle (Figure 4, B and C, I). The average distance 
between centromere clusters was 832 ± 183 nm in spindles 1.4-
1.5 μm in length (n = 50). We generated a model of a cohesin 
gradient decaying from centromeres 800 nm apart (Figure 4D, I, 
red line) and simulated its fluorescence (Figure 4E, I, red). 
Simulated fluorescence intensity was measured using line scans 
along the lobes at 90, 80, and 50% of maximum intensity 
and compared with experimental data (Figure 4, A and E). 
Simulations of a cohesin gradient from centromeres fail to match 
experimental data. The 800 nm between sister centromeres is 
much larger than the estimated length of the barrel, 550 nm 
(MLE = 0.25; Figure 4E, I, and Table 4). Pericentric cohesin does 
not span the full interkinetochore distance and cannot be 
matched by simulations of a cohesin gradient decaying from the 
centromere.
Alternatively, cohesin could be enriched at the sister cohesion axis 
in the pericentromere. Sister cohesion is maintained at a pericentric 
LacO marker 12.5 kb from CEN 11 (93% cohesion, n = 46). To map 
the probability distribution of the cohesion axis, we plotted the rela­
tive position of this LacO to a normalized spindle for multiple cells 
(Figure 4, B and C, II). The sister cohesion axis is distributed about the 
midspindle as an exponentially decaying gradient toward each spin­
dle pole (Figure 4D, II). Simulations of a pericentric cohesin gradient 
decaying from the midspindle fail to match the fluorescence distri­
bution of cohesin along the barrel, because the peak in fluorescence 
is too sharp relative to experimental cohesin distributions (n = 50 
simulated; Figure 4E, II, and Table 4). Thus cohesin is more randomly 
dispersed throughout the pericentromere than predicted by gradi­
ents originating from sites of loading or cohesion.
We explored a third option, in which cohesin is dispersed 
throughout the pericentromere between the sister centromeres. 
Bioriented LacO arrays at 3.8 kb from CEN3 were utilized to deter­
mine the relative position of pericentric chromatin in the spindle 
(Figure 4, B and C, III). Pericentromere chromatin resides in a broad 
distribution but shows peaks ∼600 nm apart, along with a mean 
separation distance of 541 nm (n = 60 cells; Figure 4, C and D, III). 
To simulate cohesin dispersed on chromatin, we randomly filled the 
best-fit cohesin barrel with the known number of fluorophores 
(500 nm wide, 550 nm long, and 50 nm thick with 240 fluorophores).

appears as a bilobed structure. Cohesin homogeneity from cell 
to cell is best matched by randomly dispersing the known number

(A) Simulations increasing fluorophore clustering (from right to left) 
in the best-fit condensin (Smc4, top) and cohesin barrels (Smc3, 
bottom). Labeling fewer positions in the cylinder results in 
heterogeneous images, whereas allowing each fluorophore 
to label a unique position produces a homogeneous image. 
(B and C) Simulations of clustering were performed by placing the 
measured number of fluorophores (240) into groups of 16, 8, 4, 2, 
or 1 and allowing them to randomly fill the condensin or cohesin 
cylinders. The result of clustering is less-unique fluorophore

positions labeled, respectively). (B) Experimental Smc4-GFP and 
condensin cylinder simulations (350-nm outer diameter, 130-nm 
inner diameter, 700-nm length) were line scanned to determine the 
percentage of each fluorescence class (i.e., one focus = purple, two 
foci = green, uniform line = blue). (C) Experimental Smc3-GFP and

Localization determinants
Cohesin is actively recruited to the pericentromere via the COMA 
(Ctf19 Okp1 Mcm21 Ame1 kinetochore complex; De Wulf et al., 
2003), which recruits Scc2/4 (Eckert et al., 2007; D'Ambrosio et al., 
2008; Fernius and Marston, 2009; Ng et al., 2009), and to rDNA 
via Sir2 (Wu et al., 2011). On deletion of MCM21, cohesin pericen­
tromere fluorescence enrichment over 
nuclear background (normalized to 1.0) is 
decreased, while cohesin fluorescence in­
tensity is increased in the rDNA (pericen­
tromere: 2.2 wild type (WT) vs. 1.3 mcm21Δ, 
p < 0.01; rDNA: 1.4 WT vs. 2.0 mcm21Δ, 
p < 0.01; n = 40 WT and 52 mcm21Δ; 
Figure 5A). Similarly, deletion of SIR2 
results in decreased cohesin fluorescence 
at the rDNA, while fluorescence increased 
in the pericentromere (rDNA: 1.4 WT 
vs. 1.1 sir2Δ, p < 0.01; pericentromere: 
2.2 WT vs. 2.6 sir2Δ, p < 0.01; n = 32). Thus 
cohesin is in equilibrium between the two 
major chromatin-binding sites.
Condensin is also loaded via Scc2/4 
(D'Ambrosio et al., 2008). However, dele­
tion of MCM21 did not affect condensin 
enrichment at the pericentromere nor 
rDNA (p > 0.73, n = 32 WT and 26 mcm21Δ; 
Figure 5B). This suggests that condensin is 
recruited to the pericentromere via another 
protein(s) that interacts with Scc2/4 and not 
COMA. If pericentric condensin structure 
or clustering is dependent on pericentric 
cohesin, then it should be disrupted in 
mcm21Δ cells. Condensin width and clus­
tering are cohesin independent, as cells 
deleted of MCM21 retain WT condensin 
distribution (n = 44; Figure 5F and Supple­
mental Figure S1B).
Condensin is required for Sir2 recruit­
ment into the nucleolus for rDNA silencing 
(Machin et al., 2004). The concentration of 
condensin in the rDNA is also dependent on 
Sir2 by ChIP (Li et al., 2013). On deletion of 
SIR2, condensin fluorescence in the rDNA 
decreased, while pericentric condensin re­
mained the same (rDNA: 4.6 WT vs. 3.1 
sir2Δ, p = 0.007; pericentromere: 3.1 WT vs. 
3.0 sir2Δ, p = 0.95, n = 21 sir2Δ; Figure 5B). 
Condensin, unlike cohesin, is not equili­
brated between these sites of action.
The organization of condensin in the 
pericentromere is dependent on Sir2. 
Condensin width increased in sir2Δ cells 
Simulations of randomly distributed cohesin best matched experi­
mental fluorescence (MLE = 0.80 − 1.01, n = 50 simulated; Table 4 
and Figure 4E, III). The random dispersion of the measured number 
of fluorophores in the pericentromere ∼125 nm from the kineto­
chore/centromere recapitulates the experimental distribution of 
pericentric cohesin.

the number of molecules, as both have ∼240 total in the total peri­
centric chromatin of 16 sister chromatids. To mimic cell-to-cell het­
erogeneity, we reduced the number of unique positions the fluoro­
phores occupy in the cylinder via clustering and randomized 
fluorophore positions from image to image. The random distribu­
tion of clusters (eight or 16 fluorophores per cluster) in simulations 
best matches condensin's heterogeneous axial fluorescence with 
approximately equal frequency of a focus, two foci, or uniform sig­
nal (Figure 3). Even in mcm21Δ cells with an increased interkineto­
chore length, the frequency of different fluorescent signals is accu­
rately matched by simulations of clustering (Figure S1B). Compiling 
experimental condensin images from a population of aligned spin­
dles revealed no preferred position within the pericentromere. The 
ensemble fluorescence was evenly distributed between kineto­
chores (Stephens et al., 2011). Taken together, the data suggest that 
condensin clusters are randomly distributed in the pericentromere 
and along the spindle axis.
Condensin clusters likely form rosettes in the pericentromere to 
resist tension via homotypic interactions (Figure 6). The idea of 
multiple loops stemming from clustered condensin has been pro­
posed as a mechanism for chromatin compaction (Vas et al., 2007; 
Hirano, 2012). Biochemical and theoretical studies suggest con­
densins work cooperatively (Melby et al., 1998; Strick et al., 2004; 
Alipour and Marko, 2012). Our data support a model in which mul­
tiple condensins (8-16) cluster to compact the pericentromere 
along the spindle axis (Figure 3). Compaction likely occurs through 
condensin gathering of distal regions of DNA to produce chiral 
loops (Kimura and Hirano, 1997; Yoshimura et al., 2002; Strick et al., 
2004; Hirano, 2006; Figure 6). Condensin has been shown to bind 
to and cluster at tRNA genes, as well as at other sites occupied by 
transcription factor TFIIIC (D'Ambrosio et al., 2008; Haeusler et al., 
(Gaussian distribution with a FWHM of 355 ± 59 nm sir2Δ vs. 325 nm 
WT, p = 0.01; Figure 5, C, D, and F). Furthermore, condensin displays 
no bilobe fluorescence in WT cells (0%, n = 42) but appears bilobed 
in 16% of sir2Δ cells imaged (n = 65; Figure 5, C and D). The bilobed 
condensin structures are smaller in diameter than cohesin barrels 
(sir2Δ condensin bilobed: 305 ± 47 nm sagittal, n = 10, p = 0.004; 
Figure 5E). Cohesin barrel size did not significantly change in sir2Δ 
cells (389 ± 55 nm sagittal, n = 12, p = 0.42; Figure 5E), suggesting 
that the size increase is specific to condensin. The bilobed condensin 
structures are homogeneous (n = 10), while spindle proximal con­
densin remain heterogeneous (Figure S1A). Therefore Sir2 contrib­
utes to the spindle proximal position of condensin, and upon its 
deletion, condensin becomes radially displaced and homogeneous.
The radial position of cohesin is dictated by pericentric chroma­
tin (Haase et al., 2012). Treatment of cells with low benomyl reduces 
microtubule dynamics and tension (Pearson, 2003). In response to 
reduced tension, the average radial position of pericentric chroma­
tin increases (diameter: 194 nm WT to 324 nm low benomyl; Haase 
et al., 2012). Similarly, the cohesin barrel expands (373 nm to 483 
nm), indicating cohesin position is influenced by the radial displace­
ment of pericentric chromatin (Figure 5E). In contrast, condensin's 
axial location is not altered in cells treated with low benomyl (335 ± 
39 nm, n = 17 compared with WT 323 nm, p = 0.4; Figure 5F). There­
fore the radial dispersion of pericentric cohesin reflects chromatin 
localization, while the axial distribution and clustering of condensin 
relies in part on Sir2.
DISCUSSION
Cohesin and condensin are essential components of the chromatin 
spring. Using model convolution on simulated geometries of co­
hesin and condensin, we determined their fine structures within 
pericentric chromatin. Cohesin is best matched by a random distri­
bution of fluorophores populating a barrel 500 nm in diameter and 
550 nm in length and a single complex ∼40 nm thick. Condensin 
fluorescence is best matched by clustered fluorophores occupying a 
350-nm hollow cylinder proximal to the interpolar spindle microtu­
bules. Understanding the differences between cohesin and con­
densin distributions in the pericentromere allow us to gain insight 
into their functions in the chromatin spring.
Pericentric cohesin has been proposed to be organized into a 
barrel distribution around the spindle microtubules (Yeh et al., 2008). 
This is consistent with the cylinder-like organization of spindle micro­
tubules seen with EM tomography and the distribution of pericen­
tric chromatin labeled with LacO/LacI-GFP (Winey et  al., 1995; 
Gardner et al., 2008; Anderson et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2011; 
Haase et al., 2012). We show here that experimental pericentric co­
hesin fluorescence from various angles of acquisition is faithfully re­
capitulated by simulated images of a hollow cylinder/barrel (Figure 
2). Cohesin's homogeneous distribution is best matched by single, 
randomly distributed fluorophores (Figure 4). The barrel is continu­
ous only in the sense that the fluorescence distribution of individual 
molecules overlaps as a consequence of the objective PSF. We can 
rule out multiple layers within the barrel (or multiple concentric bar­
rels) based on the simulations that indicate the thickness of the bar­
rel is comparable to a single cohesin ring (Figure 2D and Table 2). 
Our modeling does not address whether the molecules exist as 
single or multiple complexes (Haering and Jessberger, 2012). Model 
convolution data are consistent with cohesin dispersed throughout 
a barrel geometry surrounding the central spindle.
The distribution of condensin differs from cohesin in that it is 
neither bilobed nor homogeneous. By measuring the number of 
molecules, we know that the differences are not due to a disparity in 
FIGURE 6:  Model of cohesin and condensin in the pericentromere. 
(A) Condensin (light blue) is localized along the spindle axis in clusters, 
where it forms rosette-like loops through multiple condensin working 
cooperatively. Cohesin (dark blue) is localized radially, where it 
promotes looping to resist outward pulling forces from spindle 
microtubules. Cohesin is shown as two possible configurations: a 
single complex (left) or two complexes (right; see review in Haering 
and Jessberger, 2012). (B) Diagram of the intercentromere region. 
While condensin can span the length between sister centromere 
clusters, cohesin is displaced from the centromere cluster by ∼125 nm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell preparation
Cells were incubated in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% 
yeast extract) at 24°C for WT, mcm21, and sir2Δ strains. Asynchro­
nous cultures were grown to log phase and then imaged. Only 
metaphase cells were analyzed as outlined in Stephens et al. (2011). 
Cells were considered in metaphase with spindle lengths between 
1.3 and 1.7 μm for WT and sir2Δ strains. Cells with MCM21 deleted 
have longer spindle lengths in metaphase (Stephens et al., 2011), 
and metaphase lengths were therefore considered between 1.3 and 
2.5 μm.
Imaging
Wide-field microscope images were acquired at room temperature 
(25°C) using a microscope stand (Eclipse TE2000-U; Nikon, East 
Rutherford, NJ) with a 100× Plan-Apochromat, 1.4 numerical aper­
ture digital interference contrast oil-immersion lens with a camera 
(ORCA ER; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Meta­
Morph 7.1 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to acquire 
unbinned z-series image stacks with a z-step size of 300 nm. Popula­
tion imaging was performed in water on concanavalin A-coated 
coverslips. Image exposure times were between 400 and 800 ms.
Analyzing fluorescence
Experimental images were rotated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, 
MA) so that the spindle poles (Spc29-RFP) were aligned horizontally 
along the same y coordinate. Only single-plane images containing 
both spindle pole bodies in focus with metaphase spindle lengths 
were analyzed, except where noted (see Figure 2, experimental 
spindle tilt). Tub1, Nuf2, and Smc4-GFP fluorescence width was 
measured in MATLAB by taking line scans perpendicular to the spin­
dle axis and through the brightest pixel, then fitting to a Gaussian 
distribution to obtain a FWHM measurement. Smc3-GFP width was 
measured as the inclusive distance between peaks of the bilobe. 
Lengths of Smc3 and Smc4 enrichment along the spindle axis were 
measured by taking a line scan parallel to the spindle axis, through 
the brightest pixel, and calculating the distance between pixel coor­
dinates at half-maximum intensity above the nuclear background 
using MetaMorph.
Model convolution
The experimental PSF of our microscope was determined by imag­
ing a 100-nm fluorescent bead with 100-nm z-steps spanning 1 μm 
above and below the brightest plane. Five different z-series of 
100-nm fluorescent beads were aligned and averaged to generate 
the average PSF of our microscope (Sprague et al., 2003). The ex­
perimental PSF z-stack was imported into Microscope Simulator 
2.0.0 for use. The Microscope Simulator 2.0.0 software program 
(CISMM UNC-Chapel Hill; http://cismm.cs.unc.edu/downloads; 
Quammen et al., 2008) was used to generate geometrical cylinder 
models with length, inner diameter, and outer diameter. Cylinders 
were grid filled with fluorophores spaced 12.5 nm apart. To gener­
ate a simulated fluorescence image of the cylinders, each fluoro­
phore in the cylinder was convolved with the experimental PSF. The 
convolution of the entire cylinder matrix is the summarization of the 
contributions of the fluorescence from each simulated fluorophore 
position in x, y, and z to the image plane (Agard et al., 1989; Sprague 
et al., 2003). Image(x,y) = Σ cylinder matrix (x,y,x) ⋅ PSF(x,y,z). All 
simulated images were focused on the midplane of the cylinder. 
Random Gaussian noise (cohesin − mean 250, SD 3; condensin − 
mean 220, SD 2.6) matching the noise from experimental images 
was added to the generated images. Maximum intensity from 
2008; Iwasaki et al., 2010), providing a mechanism to cluster peri­
centromere loci. Sir2 aids in the recruitment of condensin to tRNA 
sites (Li et al., 2013), and upon Sir2 depletion, condensin may lose 
affinity for these sites, which may explain why condensin becomes 
displaced from the spindle axis in sir2Δ mutants (Figure 5). 
Condensin binding is negatively correlated with transcription activ­
ity in the rDNA locus as well as the centromere (Johzuka and 
Horiuchi, 2007, 2009; Iwasaki et al., 2010). An alternative but not 
mutually exclusive mechanism for condensin displacement in sir2Δ 
cells is that Sir2 functions to hypoacetylate centromere and pericen­
tromere regions (Choy et al., 2011, 2012) to promote transcription 
silencing in order to ensure proper condensin recruitment/binding. 
A chromatin spring composed of loops is consistent with mathemat­
ical models that recapitulate experimental spindle behavior upon 
perturbation of the chromatin spring via pericentric cohesin or con­
densin depletion (Stephens et al., 2013).
Cohesin is randomly distributed on radially dispersed pericen­
tromere loops. The broad distribution of centromere-linked LacO 
arrays provides an independent estimate of the size of the cohesin 
barrel. In 92% of cells, pericentric LacO arrays are confined within a 
530-nm diameter surrounding the spindle (see Figure 4C, III). On 
treatment of cells with a low dose of benomyl, both pericentric chro­
matin radial position and the width of cohesin barrel increase (Haase 
et al., 2012). The expansion of pericentric chromatin depends upon 
Bub1-dependent phosphorylation of H2AS121A (Haase et  al., 
2012). Thus it is the chromatin that dictates the dimensions of the 
cohesin barrel. The aggregate pericentric chromatin (32 × 50 kb = 
1.6 Mbp) in mitosis is comparable in size to the entire Escherichia 
coli nucleoid (∼4 Mbp). Because the pericentromere is confined to a 
similar volume, it is likely to exhibit features of confinement dis­
played by the bacterial nucleoid and subject to entropic polymer 
repulsion that facilitates chromosome segregation (Jun and Mulder, 
2006; Fisher et al., 2013). Cohesin plays a critical function in confin­
ing the chromatin to this radial position (depicted in Figure 6; 
Stephens et al., 2011). Cohesin embracing radial loops of different 
pericentromeres would generate a cross-linked network (Stephens 
et al., 2013), which would further confine the pericentric chromatin. 
We therefore propose that cohesin's molecular functions in entrap­
ment and compaction (Gruber et al., 2003; Haering et al., 2008; Sun 
et al., 2013) lead to confinement and cross-linking within the chro­
matin spring.
Interestingly cohesin's distribution does not span the entire peri­
centromere from kinetochore to kinetochore and instead is ∼125 nm 
away from either centromere cluster. The eviction of cohesin from 
the centromere may be necessary for proper orientation. Having 
cohesion at the centromere promotes monorientation of sister cen­
tromeres, whereas cohesion in the pericentromere promotes biori­
entation (Sakuno and Watanabe, 2009). A similar but alternative 
idea is that condensin could be displacing cohesin to aid in cen­
tromere resolution, as has been reported in Caenorhabditis elegans 
(Moore et al., 2005).
Model convolution provides a noninvasive method to deter­
mine the fine structure and distribution of cohesin and condensin 
in the mitotic segregation apparatus. Computer simulations of dif­
ferent fluorophore geometries and distributions were convolved 
with the PSF to directly assess experimental images. The axial 
position and clustering of condensin versus the radial position and 
dispersion of cohesin leads to insights into the arrangement of the 
chromatin spring. A rosette of pericentromere loops is compacted 
and confined in a geometry that distributes tension generated at 
multiple microtubule attachment sites throughout the chromatin 
network.

used to simulate cohesin fluorescence from the cohesion axis. 
Cohesin throughout the pericentromere was simulated by randomly 
dispersing the measured number of fluorophores (240), in the best-
fit cylinder dimensions (length, width, thickness), which also agrees 
with experimental data of average separation distance between 
separated sister LacO arrays at 3.8 kb.
Distribution of fluorescently labeled proteins in a 
normalized spindle
Experimental images of Cse4-GFP and LacO/LacI-GFP at 12.5 kb 
from CEN11 and LacO/LacI-GFP at 3.8 kb from CEN3 were ac­
quired with Spc29-RFP spindle pole bodies. Images were aligned 
along the horizontal spindle axis. Spindle length and the length 
between Cse4-GFP cluster or LacO/LacI-GFP focus relative to its 
nearest spindle pole body were logged in MetaMorph. All mea­
surements were normalized to the spindle length (1.0). Experimen­
tal data were used to generate an accurate simulation gradient or 
geometry that reflected either the position of the centromere 
(Cse4), the sister cohesin axis (LacO: 12.5 kb), or pericentric chro­
matin (LacO: 3.8 kb).
Intensity measurements
Intensity of Smc3 and Smc4 were measured relative to nuclear back­
ground intensity. For each image cell background, nuclear back­
ground and Smc3/4 brightest intensity and average were logged. 
Cell background intensity was subtracted from both nuclear back­
ground and Smc3/4. The intensity of Smc3/4 was compared relative 
to nuclear background intensity to yield a ratio of Smc3/4 fold inten­
sity above nuclear background for each individual cell.
simulated images was scaled to reflect the maximum intensity ob­
served in experimental images. Cylinders were randomly placed 
(±65 nm) relative to the x,y coordinates for each output-simulated 
image to avoid aliasing.
Outer diameters were increased in 25-nm intervals, and the best 
match was determined by a normalized MLE comparing measure­
ments from line scans of experimental and simulated images. MLE 
compares each individual experimental measure (xi) to the average 
(μ) and SD (σ) of a model via summing the log of [1/sqrt(2Π ⋅ σ2)] 
e^[(xi − μ)2/(2σ2)] (Edwards et al., 2007). MLE generates a negative 
number, which is arbitrary besides the fact that the highest number 
(or least negative) represents the best fit. To present an intuitive 
value, we normalized each model MLE for each different protein or 
parameter by comparing it with the experimental MLE (expMLE/
modelMLE). This results in the reported range of 0 to ∼1, where 
1 means that the model average and SD fitted the data as well as 
the experimental average and SD. Thus a larger MLE equals a 
better fit.
Simulated images (n = 50-100) were line scanned and analyzed 
in the same manner as experimental images. A designated number 
of fluorophores was used to randomly fill cylinders for each individ­
ual simulated image used to determine hetero- and homogeneity.
Counting molecules
The counting of condensin (Smc4-GFP) molecules was obtained as 
outlined for cohesin (Smc3-GFP) molecules by Yeh et al. (2008). Cells 
containing Smc4-GFP; Spc29-RFP and Cse4-GFP; Spc29-RFP were 
mixed together and prepared on the same microscope slide. 
Images were acquired at 200-nm spacing between z-planes. A 
16-pixel × 12-pixel rectangle (1040 nm × 780 nm) was manually 
placed around the Smc4-GFP signal between the spindle poles of 
metaphase cells with both spindle pole bodies (Spc29-RFP) in focus 
in the same z-plane. Background measured in a nuclear region away 
from the spindle axis was subtracted from the integrated value of 
Smc4-GFP fluorescence. This integrated intensity was then com­
pared with the integrated intensity of Cse4-GFP cluster from late 
anaphase or telophase cells. Smc4-GFP and Cse4-GFP integrated 
intensities were compared between cells in the same acquired image 
to account for possible differences in image conditions. Molecular 
counts for condensin (Smc4) were calculated by establishing the ratio 
of Smc4 signal to Cse4 and multiplying it by the measured number 
of Cse4 molecules per cluster reported by Lawrimore et al. (2011).
Measuring cohesin distribution
Line scans drawn along the Smc3-GFP lobes were taken through the 
brightest pixel. Average nuclear background was measured by tak­
ing an area 4 pixel × 4 pixel (260 nm × 260 nm) away from the spin­
dle in the nucleus. The intensities along the lobe were scaled rela­
tive to the brightest pixel (100%) and the average nuclear background 
(0%). The inclusive distance of pixel intensities greater than 90, 80, 
and 50% of maximum intensity were used to determine the width 
and shape of cohesin fluorescence distribution. Simulated images 
were analyzed in the same manner, and widths measured at 90, 80, 
and 50% were compared via normalized MLE (Table 4).
A cohesin gradient decaying from the centromere was simulated 
using concave-down (y = −0.015x2 + 0.255x − 0.08) starting from 
each centromere and spanning the distance to the other centrom­
ere (distance measured experimentally). Concave-down gradient 
was used because it qualitatively fitted the profile of experimental 
fluorescence. The distribution of the experimental the LacO array at 
12.5 kb was best fitted with an exponentially decreasing gradient 
from the midspindle (y = 1e0.005x). This best-fit equation was then
