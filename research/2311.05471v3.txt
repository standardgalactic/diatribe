Systems with nonreciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states.
These are
routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered
oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy spatially-
extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the critical behavior of the correspond-
ing phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a
nonreciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its phase transitions by means of numer-
ical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous
phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations
reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth
of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spin types is broken triggering a stabilizing
droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through
the proliferation of spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity changes
the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.
Nonreciprocal interactions naturally arise in out-
of-equilibrium
systems
[1-22]
ranging
from
neuro-
science [23-25] and social networks [26, 27] to ecol-
ogy [28-30] and open quantum systems [31-33].
A
generic feature of these systems is the emergence of
many-body limit cycles - time-dependent states arising
from non-mutual interactions between constituents. Such
states are routinely observed in experiments and simu-
lations of finite systems. A single limit cycle oscillator
subject to noise eventually forgets the initial phase [34-
44]: its temporal correlations decay with time very much
like density fluctuations decay with spatial separation in
a liquid (Fig. 1a, left).
In many-body systems, how-
ever, coherent oscillations may be restored over arbi-
trarily long periods [45-64]: temporal correlations per-
sist (without any periodic drive externally imposing a
phase) very much like spatial correlations do in a crystal
(Fig. 1a, right). In this Letter, we ask: Can many-body
limit cycles survive fluctuations in spatially-extended,
locally-coupled nonreciprocal systems of arbitrary size?
If so, what are the critical exponents of the resulting
phase transitions? We address these questions by intro-
ducing a nonreciprocal generalization of what is perhaps
the most paradigmatic statistical mechanical system: the
Ising model.
Dynamics without global optimization— In equilib-
rium, the dynamics of Ising spins is described by kinetic
Ising models in which spins σn = ±1 tend to minimize a
global potential, and hence interact reciprocally [65, 66].
To account for nonreciprocal interactions, we instead as-
sume that each spin σn tends to minimize its own selfish
energy En, and choose the probability of flipping σn at
each time step to be given by the Glauber rule
p(σn →−σn) = 1
2 [1 −tanh (∆En/(2kBT))]
(1)
where ∆En is the change in selfish energy between both
configurations, T is the temperature, and kB the Boltz-
mann constant. Since we define different potential func-
tions for each spin, the dynamics cannot be derived from
a single potential function and detailed balance is bro-
ken. This formulation encompasses several nonreciprocal
dynamics used among the physical sciences [67-76].
The nonreciprocal Ising model— Systems with nonre-
ciprocal couplings do not always exhibit macroscopic os-
cillations. These tend to occur, when a small number of
species have competing goals. Correspondingly, we split
the spins σn ≡σα
i into two species, labeled by Greek
indices α = A, B, located on sites i of a d-dimensional
cubic lattice of linear size L (Fig. 1b). Spins of the same
species tend to align with their neighbors, while spins
of different species interact in a nonreciprocal manner:
spins A tend to align with spins B, whereas spins B tend
to anti-align with spins A. This is captured by the selfish
energy

with J, K > 0, where the first term captures the intra-
species interactions with the sum running over nearest
neighbors of i, and the second term captures the inter-
species interactions where summation over species indices
β is implied (εαβ is the Levi-Civita symbol). We have as-
sumed for simplicity that inter-species interactions only
occur on-site and are purely nonreciprocal (general asym-
metric on-site interactions are considered in [77]).
Mean-field equation— Within the mean-field approx-
imation and upon rescaling of time and space, the dy-
namics of the average magnetization mα(⃗r, t) is [77]

Nonreciprocal Ising model. (a) Comparison of noisy (left) and robust (right) clocks with different types of
spatial order. (b) Schematic drawing of the nonreciprocal Ising model. The model includes two species per site with two
interaction types: 1) intra-species reciprocal nearest-neighbors interaction of strength J and 2) inter-species nonreciprocal
on-site interaction of strength K. (c) Mean-field phase diagram, (d) schematic 2D phase diagram and (e) schematic 3D phase
diagram. The three phases shown on the diagrams are (i) disorder, (ii) swap and (iii) static order. The lines separating the
phases are Hopf bifurcation (thin green), SNIC bifurcation (thick blue) and two yet undetermined transition lines (dashed
grey). Red dot is the Pitchfork bifurcation.
The phase diagram in Fig. 1c shows the stable homoge-
neous solutions of Eq. (3) as a function of the couplings
˜J and ˜K. When nonreciprocal interactions are turned
off ( ˜K = 0), a pitchfork bifurcation at ˜Jc ≡1 (red point
in Fig. 1c) separates a disordered phase (in blue) from
a ferromagnetic phase (in green), as in the equilibrium
Ising model. When nonreciprocal interactions are present
( ˜K ̸= 0), a time-dependent oscillatory state that we dub
"swap phase" arises (in pink). This limit cycle state where
both species flip their magnetizations repeatedly is sep-
arated from the disordered state by a Hopf bifurcation
at ˜Jc = 1 (green line), and from the ferromagnetic phase
by another bifurcation known as a saddle-node on an in-
variant circle (SNIC) bifurcation [78, 79] (blue line). The
shape of the limit cycle in (mA, mB) space evolves from
a circle near the Hopf bifurcation to a square near the
SNIC bifurcation [77]. The oscillation period remains fi-
nite at the Hopf bifurcation, and it diverges at the SNIC
bifurcation [78].
Monte-Carlo simulations— To go beyond the mean-
field description, we perform large-scale Monte-Carlo
(MC) simulations of the nonreciprocal Ising model in
both two and three dimensions (see [77] for details on
the update rules; we did not observe qualitative differ-
ences with other update rules). Unless mentioned other-
wise, we initialize the system in an ordered state where
all spins of the same species are either up or down, and
let the system evolve until a steady-state is reached.
The qualitative results of our simulations are summa-
rized in Fig. 1d-e. In 2D, any amount of nonreciprocity
destroys all order. In 3D, our simulations suggest that
the swap phase survives the thermodynamic limit, while
the static ferromagnetic phase is eventually destroyed by
any amount of nonreciprocity.
In order to distinguish the different possible phases, we
introduce the synchronization order parameter [45]

j /Ld are the total magnetizations and the

chronization order parameter R is zero if the system is
disordered and nonzero in both the swap and static-order
phases, while L is zero in the disordered and static-order
phases and non-zero in the swap phase [77].
Destruction of the swap phase in 2D by spiral defects—
In small 2D systems, simulations show states in which
MA and MB oscillate in time (like in the mean-field
swap phase) with a large amplitude. However, oscilla-
tions are irregular, and typically occur through nucle-
ation of droplets of opposite magnetization by the "unsat-
isfied" species, in alternating order (see Movie 1). As the
size L increases, it becomes apparent that this oscillatory
state is a transient, eventually destabilized by prolifera-
tion of spiral defects similar to the rotational-symmetric
spirals observed in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equa-
tion [47, 82-93], but whose shape has 4-fold rotational
symmetry (four "arms"). This is evidenced in Fig. 2b-c,
which shows the emergence of defects in the angle θ and
the resulting drop in the magnetizations MA and MB af-
ter an oscillatory transient, along with snapshots of θ at
different stages (see also Movie 1).
Quantitatively, the absence of a swap phase in the ther-
modynamic limit can be seen from the behavior of the or-
der parameters as system size increases. Figure. 2d shows
a color map of L as a function of ˜J and ˜K. While a regime

in which L ̸= 0, corresponding to the swap phase, appear
at L = 20, it almost diminishes completely at L = 80 .
A more thorough analysis is shown in Fig. 2e where both
R and L are shown as a function of ˜J and fixed ˜K for
different system sizes. In the intermediate region corre-
sponding to the swap phase (1.5 ≲˜J ≲3), both R and
L go to zero as L increases, thereby indicating the de-
struction of the swap phase. In addition, the putative
critical ˜J marking the transition from disorder to swap
depends on the system size, signifying the absence of a
well-defined phase transition in the thermodynamic limit.
Existence of a stable swap phase in 3D and critical
exponents— In 3D, we find that a stable swap phase does
exist. Its behavior is demonstrated in Fig. 3a where we
show a kymograph of the θ-field of a single 1D row in
the 3D lattice as well as plot the total magnetizations
as a function of time (see also Movie 2).
The oscilla-
tions are spatially homogeneous and MA(t) and MB(t)
have a fixed period and phase shift. The coherence time
of MA and MB diverges with system size as τc ∝Ld
(Fig. 3b), in agreement with a temporal crystal behavior
(Fig. 1a) [94]. In the thermodynamic limit, coherent os-
cillations persist indefinitely despite the presence of noise.
Simulations with varying system sizes reveal a well-
defined phase transition between a disordered phase with
R = 0 to a swap phase with non-zero R. Figure 3d shows
a color map of R in the ( ˜J, ˜K) space, for L = 320, while
Fig. 3e shows a cut of the color map for ˜K = 0.3, for dif-
ferent L. Unlike in 2D (Fig. 2e), here there is a critical
˜J, below which R ∼L−d/2 and above which it converges
to a non-zero value (Fig. 3e, inset). The stability of the
swap phase in 3D holds even when the inter-species sym-
metry is broken by the addition of an on-site reciprocal
coupling between the species, see Ref. [77].
Figure 3c shows that the phase-space trajectories be-
come circular when approaching the phase transition line,
supporting a Hopf behavior [95]. Renormalization group
studies based on the ϵ-expansion suggest that the uni-
versality class associated to the Hopf bifurcation is for-
mally equivalent to the universality class of the ferro-
magnet/paramagnet transition of the XY model [96, 97].
Using finite-size scaling [77] and setting ˜K = 0.1 we de-
termine the critical exponents of the correlation length,
susceptibility, and order parameter: ν = 0.675 ± 0.005,
γ = 1.328 ± 0.009, and β = 0.347 ± 0.002, which are
indeed in good agreement with 3D XY critical expo-
nents [98, 99], more so than with 3D Ising critical expo-
nents [98] corresponding to the ˜K = 0 case, see Fig. 3f.
For a fixed ˜K, the critical ˜J separating disorder from
swap depends on
˜K, in contrast with the mean-field
prediction, in which ˜Jc is independent of ˜K (Fig. 1c).
Above some critical ˜K value, the phase transition loses its
second-order-like nature (see ˜K ≳0.75 region in Fig. 3d
where R becomes discontinuous), apparently due to scroll
waves (3D analog of spiral waves) [100-104] that desta-
bilize the swap phase [77]. Within the size limitations of
our simulations, it is unclear what part of the swap phase
is destroyed by scroll waves in the thermodynamic limit
and what type of phase transition is associated with their
appearance (Fig. 1e).
We note that with random initial conditions, the sys-
tem can coarsen into long-lived scroll waves and pla-
nar waves (Fig. 3g), even when ordered initial condi-
tions would otherwise lead to global oscillations ([77] and
Movie 3).
Instability of the static-order phase due to droplet
growth in any finite dimension— In finite systems, a
ferromagnetic-like state with static order is observed both
in 2D and 3D. As system size increases, however, this
static state is destabilized by nucleation of droplets (see
Fig. 4a and Movie 4) that grow and flip the magnetiza-

tion, in alternating order of A- and B-spins. As a result,
the static-order phase is replaced by droplet-induced os-
cillations (different in nature from the homogeneous noisy
oscillations close to the Hopf bifurcation shown in Fig. 3a
and Movie 2) with oscillation period Tosc that converges
to a finite value as system size increases (Fig 4b). This is
further supported by Figs. 2e and 3e (right parts) show-
ing that the ˜J-transition-point between static order and
oscillations in finite systems (indicated by a sharp change
in the slope of R) increases with size.
To see why nonreciprocity allows droplets to grow, in
contrast with the equilibrium Ising model where they
tend to shrink, assume first that a system with small non-
reciprocal coupling K is in the static-order phase, so most
spins in both lattices are up [105]. Since the system is
static, it can be mapped into two equilibrium Ising mod-
els (Fig. 4c) with opposite magnetic fields, with energy
E = −J P
⟨i,j⟩σiσj −H P
i σi where H ≈K for A-spins
and H ≈−K for B-spins (see Eq. (2)). While sub-system
A is in a stable state in the effective equilibrium system,
sub-system B is in a metastable state, as it prefers a
state with opposite magnetization. For large enough sys-
tem size, sub-system B then transitions to its equilibrium
stable state by nucleating droplets larger than a critical
size ρc whose value depends on ˜J and ˜K [105, 106]. After
a droplet has expanded beyond ρc, the stable sub-system
becomes metastable and nucleates droplets, and so on
(Fig. 4c). Crucially, for finite ˜J and ˜K, ρc is finite, mak-
ing the static-order phase unstable in the thermodynamic
limit in any finite dimension. Note that when the sym-
metry between the spin species is broken, droplets do not
expand at the same velocity, leading to droplet-capture
and shrinkage that can re-stabilize the static-order phase
(Fig. 4d and Movie 5). This can be achieved, for example,
by modifying the inter-species interaction in the selfish
energy, Eq. (2), to be −Kαβσα
i σβ
i where KAB = K++K−
and KBA = K+ −K−(see Ref. [77] for details).
What is the fate of the droplet-induced oscillations
regime occurring at high ˜J/ ˜K?
In 2D it is unstable
due to spirals (Fig. 2).
In 3D, it exhibits large struc-
tures with out-of-phase regions [77], in contrast with the
more homogeneous swap phase occurring at lower ˜J/ ˜K
as in Fig. 3a.
Moreover, in this regime the degree of
synchronization in 3D, while clearly decreasing, does not
converge with system size (Fig. 3e, ˜J ≳2). It is there-
fore unclear whether the resulting phase is disordered or
oscillating, but the static order can be ruled out (Fig. 1e).
We have found that the only stable phase in 2D and
3D, other than disorder, is the 3D swap phase.
This
can be traced to the fact that the swap phase sponta-
neously breaks a continuous symmetry (continuous time-
translation invariance) rather than a discrete one [77].
In this case, an analogy with the Mermin-Wagner the-
orem [107, 108] in the time domain [109-111] suggests
that order is destroyed in d ≤2 by the fluctuations of
the Goldstone modes associated with the broken contin-
uous time translation invariance, but is possible in d ≥3.
In addition, contrary to discrete symmetries, phases with
spontaneously broken continuous symmetries do not sup-
port well-defined droplet excitations (domain walls are
progressively blurred as time evolves) and are therefore
stable against droplet growth [47, 60, 77, 112].
We have shown that a nonreciprocal generalization
of the 3D Ising model can act as a stable spatially-
distributed clock characterized by well-defined critical
properties reminiscent of time-crystals [100, 113-121].

The largest droplet at t = 20 is shown to expand in later
times, while the second largest droplet, which did not exceed
the critical droplet size, ρc, shrunk and disappeared in later
times. System parameters:

Tosc is mea-

The period is finite at the critical point ˜Jc,
supporting a Hopf-like behavior. Dashed grey line separates
a regime in which the oscillations are driven by well-defined
droplets (right) from a regime in which they do not (left).
(c) Schematic drawing of the droplet argument for the in-
stability of the static-order phase.
A system in the static-
order phase (first row) can be reduced into two equilibrium
Ising models subject to magnetic fields (second row), where
one system is in a stable equilibrium while the other in a
metastable state. The metastable system nucleates droplets
that expand and flip the magnetization (third row). The sta-
ble system becomes metastable and nucleates droplets that
expand with the same velocity (fourth row), and so on. (d)
Snapshots of θ in a 2D system with broken symmetry between
the spin species. Simulation parameters: ˜J = 3.3, ˜K+ = 0.1,
˜K−= 0.3, and L = 150. See Movie 5 for the full evolution.
Species B nucleates a droplet, but before it reaches system
size, a nested droplet of A-spins nucleates and expands more
rapidly, eventually catching up with the boundaries of the B-
droplet, making it shrink and disappear. This mechanism can
stabilize the static-order phase when ˜K+ < ˜K−[77].
While minimalistic, this model contains features aris-
ing in models of the human brain [67], opinion dynam-
ics [122, 123], spinor BECs [31, 124, 125] and microme-
chanical oscillators [69], which can all be modeled by non-
potential spin systems.
