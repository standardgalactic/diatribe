Hippocampal representations drift in stable 
multisensory environments
Jason R. Climer1,2,3, Heydar Davoudi1,3, Jun Young Oh1,3 & Daniel A. Dombeck1 ✉
Experiments that track hippocampal place cells in mice navigating the same real 
environment have found significant changes in neural representations over a period 
of days1,2. However, whether such 'representational drift' serves an intrinsic function, 
such as distinguishing similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, or is instead 
observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behaviour5-7, remains 
unresolved. Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual 
reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do 
not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place 
cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with 
more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational 
drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and 
highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability.
Place cell ensembles in the hippocampus had long been thought of as 
the stable substrate for spatial long-term memories8. Yet, experiments 
that tracked place cells in mice navigating the same environment over 
days challenged this idea with evidence of significant changes in the 
representations, a phenomenon called representational drift1,2,9-12. 
Hippocampal representational drift could serve as a mechanism to 
distinguish between similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, 
provide computational benefits such as continual learning3, generaliza-
tion13,14 and allowing for redundancy15, or be a side effect of computa-
tions that have these benefits13,15. Conversely, drift could simply be a 
readout of subtle differences in behaviour, such as running speed5,16-18, 
or the sensory environment, such as olfactory cues19-21, that are difficult 
to measure and control, yet highly notable and perceptible to the ani-
mal. This latter hypothesis that drift occurs owing to subtle sensory or 
behavioural variabilities has gained some support from experimental 
observations13 and analyses6. For example, in the hippocampus CA1 
of Egyptian fruit bats, little representational drift was observed over 
days when the behaviour (flight path) was highly stereotyped7. Nota-
bly, however, few experiments that control for subtle behavioural and 
environmental variabilities have been performed, making it unclear 
whether such variabilities could provide a general explanation for 
representational drift. Therefore, we used the precise sensory con-
trol afforded by a multisensory (visual and olfactory) virtual reality 
system22,23 and the behavioural control achieved by head-fixed mice 
running through the environment using a linear treadmill to determine 
whether subtle behavioural and sensory variabilities have an effect on 
the rate of representational drift in hippocampal CA1 of mice24.
Drift in familiar environments
Representational drift in mouse CA1 place cells has been observed in 
real1,2,4,11,12,25,26 and virtual9,10,27 environments with different environ-
ment sizes and shapes, treadmill types (for instance, spherical with 
motion constrained to one dimension9 or cylindrical27), sensory cues 
and reward conditions. Therefore, we first sought to confirm that hip-
pocampal CA1 drift occurs in our apparatus, which consists of a virtual 
linear track and a one-dimensional cylindrical treadmill28,29 (Fig. 1a,b), 
and to quantify the drift rate with previously used metrics2,9,10,25,26.
To reduce behavioural variables from outside the recording ses-
sion that may affect hippocampal drift30,31, we singly housed mice in 
identical, unenriched cages (no exercise wheels), transported them in 
enclosed dark carts, and maintained them in darkness with high-volume 
white noise in the experiment room to minimize external stimuli. The 
water-restricted mice received water rewards 2.25 m down a 3-m visual 
virtual track, a track length resembling those in other physical and 
virtual track place cell studies9-11,28,29,32. Mice were trained until they 
reached a behavioural task engagement level based on anticipatory 
slowing behaviour before the reward (mean ± s.d.: 20 ± 3.6 training 
days, 77.5 ± 2.5 traversal laps per session; Fig. 1d,e, Extended Data 
Fig. 1a-c and Methods) comparable with those in other studies33,34. 
Once this criterion was reached, we used two-photon microscopy to 
image calcium transients in populations of dorsal CA1 neurons using 
GCaMP8m (Fig. 1c).
We imaged the same populations of neurons for five consecutive 
days. As previous reports have suggested that technical difficulties in 
identifying and recording from the same neurons over days could explain 
previous observations of representational drift35,36, we developed a 
quantitative method based on volumetric plane registration to precisely 
identify the same imaging fields across days (Fig. 1f and Methods). Our 
plane registration precision was around 2 µm—that is, 15% of the diameter 
of an average mouse CA1 pyramidal cell37 (approximately 13.2 µm). This 
robust registration methodology resulted in tight cross-correlations 
of the spatial footprints (Fig. 1g) and high correlations of cellular mor-
phologies across days (median Pearson's correlation of spatial footprints 
(r) = 0.92, n = 8,883 region of interest (ROI) pairs from 1,353 cells that 
were active on multiple days; Fig. 1h). We further confirmed visually

imaging field), and similar to previous reports1,2,4,9-11,25,26, observed a 
range of spatial tuning stability over the days of imaging, with some 
place cells expressing stable tuning and others exhibiting unstable 
tuning (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 1f,g). Whereas the overall quality 
of the spatial code within days was preserved (Extended Data Fig. 1h, 
n = 6 mice, two-way ANOVA across mice and days; total active neurons 
F(4,20) = 0.18, P = 0.95; fraction of place cells, F = 0.33, P = 0.85; spa-
tial information of place cells, F = 0.72, P = 0.59), we observed quali-
tative differences in the population spatial tuning over the five days 
when we inspected sorted and cross-validated heat maps of the same 
cells (Fig. 1k). We then quantified representational drift with multi-
ple statistical measures and found statistically significant drift over 
the five recording days in all eight measures (Fig. 1l-n and Extended 
Data Fig. 1i,j; two-way ANOVA across mice and day, day effect; recur-
rence probability, F(4,20) = 24.5, P ≈ 0; population vector (PV) cor-
relation, F = 22.3, P = 3.9 × 10−7; tuning curve (TC) correlation, F = 4.8, 
P = 0.0072; place field peak shift, F = 5.9, P = 0.0027; Bayesian decod-
ing error, F = 6.0, P = 0.0024; Frobenius norm, F = 37.2, P = 5.3 × 10−9; 
representational similarity, F = 13.9, P = 1.4 × 10−5; representational 
drift index, F = 21.9, P ≈ 0; Methods; see Supplementary Table 1 for all 
ANOVA statistics). Our recurrence probability analysis revealed that 
only 164 out of the 391 place cells (41.9%) identified on day 1 had the 
same place fields on day 5. Therefore, significant representational 
drift occurs in the hippocampus of mice running on a linear treadmill 
in a familiar virtual environment, consistent with previous studies in 
virtual and real-world experimental settings2,9-11.
Drift persists with reproducible behaviour
Hippocampal place coding in mice shows dependencies on different 
behavioural factors, such as running speed and head direction5,16-18. 
Therefore, we explored whether differences in mouse behaviour across 
days could explain drift in our experimental set-up. We focused on the 
speed versus track position profiles for each traversal lap, because this 
was one of the most salient behavioural differences across laps in our 
one-dimensional navigation task. For each mouse, from the dozens 
of laps per day, we sub-selected two different sets of laps. First, we 
sub-selected and found 20 laps that were both highly similar within each 
day and highly similar between days ('similar' set; Fig. 2a,c, Extended 
Data Fig. 2a-c and Methods). Second, we sub-selected and found 20 
laps that were highly similar within each day but were highly dissimilar 
between days ('dissimilar' set; Fig. 2b,d and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c). 
The within-day behavioural correlation was indistinguishable between 
the two sets (Fig. 2e; three-way ANOVA across all laps, similar and dis-
similar sets, mice and days; set effect: F(2,78) = 21.5, P = 3.7 × 10−8; 
Tukey-Kramer post hoc test P = 0.61), whereas the across-day behav-
ioural difference was significantly larger in the dissimilar sets (Fig. 2f; 
ANOVA across all days, similar and dissimilar sets and mice; similar 
and dissimilar set effect: F(2,10) = 190.1, P = 1.1 × 10−8; Tukey-Kramer 
post hoc tests P < 0.05).
As running speed was related to representational drift in mouse 
V16, and flight path differences was related to drift in bat CA17, we 
expected less drift when examining similar sets compared to dissimi-
lar sets. However, when we examined the cross-validated place cell 
population heat maps restricted to the two different traversal sets, 
we observed no qualitative differences (Fig. 2g,h). Similarly, when we 
quantified representational drift using the multiple statistical measures 
described above, we found no statistical difference between the two 
sets (Fig. 2i-k and Extended Data Fig. 2d; three-way ANOVA across simi-
lar and dissimilar sets, mice and days, sets effect: recurrence probability 
F(1,49) = 0.077, P = 0.78; PV correlation, F = 1.6, P = 0.22; TC correlation, 
F = 0.097, P = 0.76; place field peak shift, F = 0.32, P = 0.57; Bayesian 
decoding error, F = 2.0, P = 0.16; Frobenius norm, F = 0.83, P = 0.37; 
representational similarity, F = 0.72, P = 0.40; representational drift 
index, F = 0.088, P = 0.77). Therefore, the CA1 representational drift rate 
in mice is not detectably changed by differences in running behaviour, 
with significant drift still occurring even when laps with highly similar 
behaviour were selected across days.
Cognitive factors such as attention—which is often inferred from 
task engagement—could influence the rate of representational drift34. 
Previous studies have used pre-reward licking as evidence that mice 
have learned the location of a reward, and once learned, pre-lick serves 
as a measure of task engagement9,33,34. Similar to these studies, our 
mice consistently and robustly exhibited pre-reward licking, indicat-
ing strong task engagement (Extended Data Figs. 1d,e and 3a-f). To 
investigate whether subtle differences in task engagement affect the 
rate of representational drift, we divided laps from each session into 
higher and lower pre-reward lick selectivity sets and found little to no 
significant difference in drift rates (Extended Data Fig. 4; three-way 
ANOVA across days, mice and set; set effect: recurrence probability, 
F(1,40) = 5.7, P = 0.022; PV correlation, F = 0.87, P = 0.36; TC correla-
tion, F = 5.5, P = 0.024; place field peak shift, F = 1.2, P = 0.27; Bayesian 
decoding error, F = 7.2, P = 0.011; Frobenius norm, F = 2.3, P = 0.14; rep-
resentational similarity, F = 5.0, P = 0.031; representational drift index, 
F = 2.1, P = 0.15; Methods). Furthermore, across all mice, we detected no 
significant correlations between average lick selectivity and drift rate 
in six of the drift metrics, weak correlation in one (Frobenius norm) and 
some correlation in one (representational similarity; Extended Data 
Fig. 5a). Therefore, the CA1 representational drift rate in mice shows 
little or no change due to subtle differences in task engagement, with 
significant drift still occurring even in laps and mice with the highest 
lick selectivity.
Drift persists in reproducible environments
Next, we hypothesized that subtle changes in the sensory environment 
over days might be the source of CA1 representational drift. Our visual 
virtual environment was the same each day and any auditory cues were 
masked with a white noise sound generator. By contrast, olfactory cues 
were not controlled in our set-up (Fig. 1) or in previous mouse experi-
ments in which significant hippocampal drift was obser­ved1,2,4,9-11,25,26. 
Mice are highly olfactory mice, with the ability to detect extremely 
small variations in olfactory stimuli19-21. For example, mice display 
sensitivity and behavioural responses to odour concentrations39 below 
1 × 10−10 M. Moreover, changes in the odour of an environment can 
induce changes in spatial tuning in hippocampal place cells22,23,40-42. 
Therefore, even small changes in olfactory cues from day to day could 
be perceptible to mice and could lead to differences in spatial repre-
sentations over days.
To test the hypothesis that subtle odour variabilities may affect 
representational drift, we precisely controlled both the visual and 
the olfactory sensory cues that were available to the mice using our 
recently developed visual-olfactory multisensory virtual reality sys-
tem22,23 (Fig. 3a). We began with the 'flat odour' task, in which mice 
(n = 5) were provided with a fixed concentration of α-pinene odorant 
via an airstream through a nose cone that enveloped their nose (Fig. 3b). 
During all training and imaging days, mice consistently experienced 
this odour identity and concentration. The visual virtual reality environ-
ment was the same as used in Fig. 1 and, importantly, the within-day and 
across-day similarity between speed versus track position profiles for 
the flat odour group was indistinguishable from those of the 'uncon-
trolled odour' group (Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Figs. 1b-e and 3a,b; 
repeated-measures ANOVA on within-day correlation, task-by-day 
interaction; F(4,36) = 0.49, P = 0.74; across-day behavioural difference 
rank-sum P = 0.66). When we examined the spatial code of CA1 place 
cells in the uncontrolled odour and flat odour tasks, we found no differ-
ence in the fraction of place cells recorded (Fig. 3g, 34.0% versus 36.2% 
in the uncontrolled odour versus flat odour task, χ2 = 0.70, P = 0.40), 
but, notably, there was a significant increase in the spatial information 
in place cells in the flat odour task (Fig. 3h, rank-sum P = 4.5 × 10−6).

Based on the previous odour-sensitive place cell studies22,23,40,41, we 
expected less drift in the flat odour group compared with the uncon-
trolled odour group. However, when we looked at the cross-validated 
place cell population heat maps, we observed no qualitative differences 
between these two groups (Figs. 1k and 3i). Similarly, when we quantified 
representational drift using the multiple statistical measures described 
above, we found no significant differences (Fig. 3l-n and Extended Data 
Fig. 3h; repeated-measures ANOVA, task-by-day interaction; recurrence 
probability, F(4,36) = 0.49, P = 0.75; PV correlation, F = 0.45, P = 0.77;

in mice is not significantly changed when the sensory environment is 
precisely reproduced and controlled.
Although drastic changes to the visual environment are known to 
cause partial and global remapping43,44, the effect of more subtle envi-
ronment variability on representational drift rate across days is poorly 
understood. To further test the effect of odour environment variability 
on representational drift rate, we developed a 'variable odour' task in 
which we used our multisensory virtual reality system to systematically 
introduce different odours (α-pinene, methyl valerate or mix) and 
concentrations across laps and days (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 3g 
and Methods). Again, the visual virtual reality environment was the

same as used in Fig. 1, and the within-day similarity between speed 
profiles along the track for this variable odour group (n = 6) was indis-
tinguishable from those of the uncontrolled and flat odour groups 
(Fig. 3e,f and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d; repeated-measures ANOVA on 
within-day similarity, task-by-day interaction effect: F(8,56) = 0.43, 
P = 0.90; ANOVA on across-day behavioural difference: F(2,14) = 0.95, 
P = 0.41). Interestingly, the presence of the variable odour enhanced 
the CA1 spatial code, with a higher fraction of place cells in this task 
(Fig. 3g; 59.0%, a 1.7-fold increase compared with the uncontrolled task, 
χ2 = 144, P ≈ 0). Moreover, the place cells had higher spatial information 
than those in the uncontrolled odour task (rank-sum P = 1.6 × 10−6) 
and were similar to those in the flat odour task (P = 0.58). When we 
examined the heat maps (Fig. 3j) and quantified representational 
drift rate using the multiple statistical measures, we found little to 
no difference between the three tasks (Fig. 3l-n and Extended Data 
Fig. 3h; repeated-measures ANOVA, task-by-day interaction; recurrence 
probability, F(8,56) = 2.0, P = 0.068; PV correlation, F = 2.1, P = 0.046; 
TC correlation, F = 1.1, P = 0.41; place field peak shift, F = 1.4, P = 0.23; 
Bayesian decoding error, F = 2.6, P = 0.018; Frobenius norm, F = 1.7, 
P = 0.11; representational similarity, F = 1.3, P = 0.25; representational 
drift index, F = 0.87, P = 0.55).
In addition, based on studies that show multisensory spatial infor-
mation increases attention1,9,45, we hypothesized that enrichment of 
multisensory spatial information could change drift rate. Therefore, 
we designed a multisensory task in which both the visual and olfactory 
cues were spatially tuned and provided information about reward loca-
tion ('spatial odour' task; Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 3e,f and Methods). 
The odour gradient peaked at the reward location and subsequently 
tapered off, providing mice enriched multisensory information to 
integrate while navigating to the reward. The hippocampal drift rate of 
mice in this task was not different from the other three tasks (Fig. 3k and 
Extended Data Fig. 3h; repeated-measures ANOVA, task-by-day inter-
action: recurrence probability, F(12,76) = 1.6, P = 0.11; PV correlation, 
F = 1.8, P = 0.062; TC correlation, F = 1.6, P = 0.11; place field peak shift, 
F = 1.4, P = 0.19; Bayesian decoding error, F = 2.2, P = 0.019; Frobenius 
norm, F = 1.6, P = 0.10; representational similarity, F = 1.9, P = 0.049; 
representational drift index, F = 1.62, P = 0.10).
Finally, we explored whether similar variability as the variable odour 
task in the visual sensory modality could change the representational drift 
rate across days. We therefore designed a 'variable visual' task in which 
the brightness of the virtual environment varied lap-by-lap at different 
levels within and across days (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Methods).  
We altered the overall brightness of the entire environment, as such 
brightness changes also occur in natural habitats of mice, where vari-
ations in daylight (such as morning, noon and evening) and weather 
conditions (such as sunny or cloudy weather) create fluctuations in 
visual sensory input within and across days. The mice detected these 
brightness differences, indicated by their pupil size changes, with 
behaviour resembling the non-variable visual task (Extended Data 
Fig. 6c-f, within-day behavioural correlation, task-by-day interaction 
F(4,44) = 0.19, P = 0.94; across-days behavioural difference rank-sum, 
P = 0.95). Notably, hippocampal drift rates under this visual variabil-
ity task showed no statistical difference from the non-variable visual 
task (Extended Data Fig. 6g,h, repeated-measures ANOVA task-by-day 
interaction: recurrence probability F(4,44) = 0.50, P = 0.73; PV corre-
lation, F = 0.38, P = 0.82; TC correlation, F = 0.49, P = 0.74; peak shift, 
F = 0.74, P = 0.57; Bayesian decoding error, F = 0.049, P = 0.99; Frobenius 
norm, F = 0.34, P = 0.85; representational similarity, F = 0.77 P = 0.55; 
representational drift index, F = 1.12, P = 0.36). Therefore, overall, the 
CA1 representational drift rate in mice is not detectably changed by 
differences in sensory environment variability across days, with similar 
significant drift still occurring when the sensory environment is either 
precisely controlled or more varied.
Our analysis so far has focused on place cells encoding track posi­
tion, but it is possible that other variables are also significantly encoded, 
or influence the spatial coding, during our tasks46. To examine these 
possibilities, we first constructed 'internal tuning curves'47 solely on the 
basis of population activity, independent of the mouse's track position. 
For neurons with internal TCs, we (separately) applied our original 
spatial position analysis and compared the internal and spatial TCs 
across the population within each session. We found that the two TCs 
were highly similar, with the overall population structure being highly 
similar between the two forms of analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5b-d). 
Second, based on a recent study that showed that hippocampal repre-
sentations can be influenced by the sensory input associated with each 
human experimenter's identity48, we sought to determine whether the 
experimenters could influence drift rates. We ensured that a single 
experimenter handled each mouse in all five imaging days across our 
experiments. We then examined whether different experimenter identi-
ties were associated with different rates of representational drift, but 
found no significant effect of experimenter identity (n = 2 experiment-
ers) on the drift rate (repeated-measures ANOVA, experimenter-by-day 
interaction: recurrence probability, F(4,108) = 0.83, P = 0.51; TC cor-
relation, F = 1.14, P = 0.34; PV correlation, F = 1.07, P = 0.38; place field 
peak shift, F = 1.6, P = 0.17; Bayesian decoding error, F = 0.37, P = 0.82; 
Frobenius norm, F = 1.63, P = 0.17; representational similarity, F = 1.00, 
P = 0.41; representational drift index, F = 1.55, P = 0.19). Thus, consist-
ent with previous work47, we conclude that space (track position) is 
the dominant feature of the hippocampal representation during our 
tasks and experimenter identity did not significantly change drift rate.
Neuronal excitability predicts stability
We have established that neither behavioural nor sensory variabilities in 
our tasks explain hippocampal CA1 representational drift in mice across 
days, suggesting that drift is not externally driven and may instead 
be determined by intrinsic cellular or circuit mechanisms. Although 
some functional properties of place cells have previously been associ-
ated with stability over days (little drift on the single-cell level), such as 
lap-by-lap variability and place field distance to reward34,49, a systematic 
analysis of such properties as well as properties related to the recording 
signal quality that could affect cell detection over days has not been 
performed. Therefore, we divided place cells from the 30 mice across 
our 5 tasks into stable place cells (recurred for 4 or more days based 
on recurrence probability; 9.0%, 724 out of all 8,014 neurons; 16.8% of 
place cells per mouse; Methods) and unstable place cells (recurred for 
two or fewer days based on recurrence probability; 18.4%, 1,471 out of 
all 8,014 neurons; 35.6% of place cells per mouse; Fig. 4a-e, Extended 
Data Figs. 7a,b and 8a and Methods). The remaining 45.9% of place 
cells (23.3%, 1,865 out of all 8,014 neurons) were excluded from the 
following analysis, as they could not be clearly categorized as either 
stable or unstable. As expected from these definitions, heat maps of 
stable cells were highly similar over days and heat maps of unstable 
cells were highly dissimilar. These observations were quantified using 
various measures of representational drift (Fig. 4f-h and Extended Data 
Fig. 8b, n = 30 mice, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between stable and 
unstable cells on emerge day + 2, recurrence probability, P = 2.6 × 10−6; 
PV correlation, P = 2.6 × 10−6; TC correlation, P = 2.6 × 10−6; place field 
peak shift, P = 2.6 × 10−6; Frobenius norm, P = 6 × 10−5; representational 
similarity, P = 2.6 × 10−6).
As CA1 drift does not appear to be externally driven, we examined 
whether any functional properties of place cells on the 'emerge' day 
were correlated to stability over subsequent days. We found that sev-
eral cellular features related to neuronal excitability of the stable cell 
groups were significantly greater with larger effect sizes, compared 
with those of the unstable cell groups on the emerge day (Fig. 4i and 
Extended Data Fig. 8c,d; Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Cohen's D; aver-
age ΔF/F, P = 1.7 × 10−6, D = 2.1; transient integral, P = 3.5 × 10−6, D = 1.4; 
per cent active laps, P = 4.7 × 10−6, D = 1.4; per cent significant transients,

days (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 8g). By contrast, we found some 
significant differences, but with only small effect sizes, between stable 
versus unstable cell groups in their spatial tuning properties on the 
emerge day (Fig. 4j and Extended Data Fig. 8e,h; spatial information, 
P = 6.3 × 10−5, D = 0.90; place field distance to reward, P = 0.17, D = 0.21; 
place cell firing imprecision, P = 0.016, D = 0.48). Finally, as a control 
for properties related to our imaging quality, we examined signal qual-
ity measures such as baseline noise and baseline fluorescence on the 
emerge day (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 8f) and across days (Fig. 4m 
and Extended Data Fig. 8i) and only observed weak statistical differ-
ences with small effect sizes between stable versus unstable place cell 
groups (baseline noise, P = 0.0018, D = 0.64; baseline fluorescence, 
P = 0.0050, D = 0.59). These signal quality features also showed weak, 
if any, correlations with excitability and spatial measures of place cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 9). Finally, when we extended the same analysis 
to all active cells (not just place cells) we found highly similar results 
(Extended Data Fig. 10 and Methods). Therefore, greater neuronal 
excitability, rather than spatial tuning properties or experimental

recording differences, were most correlated to place field stability 
over the following days.
Based on these results, we then explored how well the excitability 
features on the emerge day could predict the destiny of place cells (that 
is, binary classification of stable versus unstable place cells) over days 
using elastic net logistic regression analysis (Fig. 4n,o and Methods). 
Our regression model, trained with multiple excitability, spatial and 
signal quality properties, was able to predict and classify place cells 
with 69% accuracy on a 200-neuron counter-balanced test data set 
(Fig. 4n). When excitability, spatial, or signal quality features were left 
out of the model training steps, only leaving out excitability proper-
ties had a significant effect on the prediction accuracy of place cell 
stability over days (Fig. 4o; excitability properties, P = 4.1 × 10−17; spatial 
properties, P = 0.74; signal quality, P = 0.67). Therefore, not only does 
neuronal excitability correlate with place field stability over days, but 
this intrinsic property also has significant power to predict which place 
fields are more likely to persist or drift.
Discussion
Here we have been motivated by the question of whether behavioural 
and sensory variabilities could provide a general explanation for rep-
resentational drift in the hippocampus. To answer this, we utilized our 
recently designed multisensory virtual reality system and developed 
an online volumetric plane registration method that allowed us to 
precisely and robustly identify the same cells across days with approxi-
mately 2-μm error in xyz planes. This registration method represents a 
marked improvement over the across-day imaging plane identification 
methods used in previous representational drift research.
We first compared drift rates using laps with similar and dissimilar 
running speed profiles across days and found no detectable difference 
in the rates (Fig. 2). Our result supports the idea that hippocampal 
drift in mice is not caused by overt behavioural variability across days, 
although we cannot rule out the possibility that some more subtle 
behavioural variables that we did not consider here might have var-
ied across days and led to the observed drift. Our result differs from 
studies that describe the modulation of V1 representations by running 
behaviour over days6, which suggest that the stability of the primary 
sensory region may be more heavily influenced by behavioural changes 
than higher association areas, such as the hippocampus. However, 
a hippocampal place cell study in bats7 found little or no drift when 
considering constrained flight paths with highly stereotyped speed 
patterns, which brings species differences into the mix of factors that 
might possibly influence representational drift35. More research is 
required to determine how behavioural influences on representational 
drift vary across brain regions and animal species.
Mouse behaviour can be strongly affected by even small changes in 
the sensory environment. As olfactory cues are known to be involved 
in driving place firing in CA11,22,23,40,41,50,51, we reasoned that the olfactory 
environment—particularly surface odours, which are difficult to clean, 
could change over days and be detected by the mice—was a significant 
uncontrolled sensory feature in previous mouse CA1 representational 
drift studies2,9,10,26. However, we found that the CA1 representational 
drift rate was comparable between controlled (flat odour) and uncon-
trolled odour tasks. Further, even when we introduced variable odour 
(Fig. 3) and variable visual tasks within and across days (Extended Data 
Fig. 6), the drift rate was similar and did not increase. Our results sup-
port the idea that hippocampal drift in mice is not caused by overt olfac-
tory or visual variability across days. Although at first glance our result 
may seem surprising, we recently showed that only sensory modalities 
with behavioural relevance have a strong influence on the cognitive 
map23. This prior research did not examine such influences on the stabil-
ity of the cognitive map over days, but when combined with our results 
here, we can speculate that representational drift is also not influenced 
by variable sensory modalities that have little behavioural relevance.
Although it is unclear what role CA1 representational drift has in 
memory and cognition, our results support the idea that drift is an 
internally generated phenomenon, rather than externally driven. We 
were able to determine several cellular features that predicted place cell 
stability (Fig. 4), which may help to illuminate the neural mechanisms of 
drift and lead to a deeper understanding of the cognitive role of drift in 
the future. Our finding that excitability features of cells are predictors 
of their long-term stability (that is, little drift) is particularly interest-
ing in the context of previous research that has found a link between 
excitability and the likelihood that a CA1 neuron is recruited to encode 
a new experience29,52,53. Indeed, in computational research, simulated 
Hebbian networks with fluctuating excitability over time could gener-
ate representational drift54. Further, excitability is a key parameter in 
memory linking, with more excitable cells being more likely to link 
memories across contexts55 and, notably, a reduction in the excitability 
of hippocampal neurons occurs during ageing56. Thus, our finding may 
imply that the hippocampal representational drift rate increases during 
ageing, leading to a prediction that could be tested in future research.
Although our results support the idea that drift is an internally gener-
ated phenomenon largely related to cellular excitability, this does not 
mean that external factors do not (or cannot) affect the rate of represen-
tational change. For example, as more and more sensory features of an 
environment are changed, smaller changes to the representation (such 
as rate remapping) are observed, and eventually, large changes occur 
(such as global remapping)43,44. Therefore, external factors certainly 
have a role in determining how consistent a representation is over 
days. Our study instead explores the other end of the spectrum—such 
as the stability of the hippocampal representation when external fac-
tors are highly stable or varied in a systematic way. Our finding that 
representational drift still persists when external factors are clamped 
or controlled (as much as currently possible) and even when external 
factors are subtly changed indicates that, in such scenarios, the drift 
rate is driven largely by intrinsic factors for which intrinsic cellular 
excitability is the strongest determining factor that we identified.
We controlled for behavioural and sensory environment variability 
at comparable levels to the recent bat CA1 research, but still found 
CA1 representational drift. Therefore, our results might alternatively 
suggest that the CA1 regions of bats and mice are fundamentally dif-
ferent in terms of representational stability. This idea is further sup-
ported by previous research, which has found significant differences 
between these two species regarding hippocampal place cell properties 
and oscillations57 and cellular-level electrophysiological properties58. 
Notably, it is currently unknown whether bats have overall more excit-
able CA1 neurons compared with mice and whether such potential 
differences in excitability between mice and bats lead to the observed 
differences in representational drift.
Representational drift has been observed across many brain regions, 
tasks and species, with rates of drift that vary considerably. For exam-
ple, neural representations are relatively stable in motor areas35,59 but 
not in the primary olfactory cortex60 or the posterior parietal cortex61. It 
is possible that differences in neuronal excitability may underlie many 
of these previously observed differences in drift rate. However, these 
previous studies also used vastly different behaviours, which may also 
explain differences in drift rate. For example, the highly stereotyped 
motor patterns exhibited by lever pressing rats62, flying bats7 and sing-
ing songbirds35 may be fundamentally different types of behavioural 
stereotypy compared with the behavioural similarity considered here 
(laps with more similar speed or pre-lick profiles). Moreover, because 
our experiments were performed in highly controlled virtual reality 
conditions, they do not fully reflect the complexity of natural environ-
ments. Thus, it remains uncertain how well our findings will translate to 
more naturalistic settings, where animals experience a broader range 
of sensory input variability and complex behaviours. Furthermore, 
although we took extensive measures to minimize animals' experiences 
outside the experiments (such as single housing, no cage changes, no

running wheel and enclosed transport), we did not systematically moni-
tor or control variables such as activity levels, sleep, grooming or forag-
ing behaviours in the home cage or other factors such as hippocampal 
replay that occurred outside of experimental sessions. More research 
is needed to determine how these and all the factors considered here 
fit into a general explanation for the drift phenomenon across brain 
regions and species.

All mouse procedures were approved by the Northwestern University 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were singly housed 
in identical, unenriched cages (for example, no exercise wheels) and 
kept on a reverse light-dark cycle (experiments during mouse night-
dark cycle) at 20-24 °C and 30%-70% humidity. Male C57BL/6 mice 
around 10 weeks of age were anaesthetized using 1%-2% isoflurane. To 
induce the expression of GCaMP8m63 in the hippocampus CA1, a volume 
of 90−125 nl of an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV1.syn.GCaMP8m.
WPRE.SV40) with a titre of 2.5 × 1013 genome copies per ml was admin-
istered via a bevelled glass micropipette. A 1-mm diameter craniotomy 
was performed on the right hippocampus, at a location precisely 1.8 mm 
lateral and 2.3 mm caudal from bregma. The micropipette containing 
the virus was carefully inserted to a depth of 1.3 mm beneath the dura 
surface and the virus was injected. The mice then underwent water 
restriction, receiving 0.8-1 ml per day, for the duration of the study. Fol-
lowing 2-7 days post-injection, hippocampal window implantation was 
performed, wherein a stainless-steel cannula featuring a glass coverslip 
affixed on one side was placed over the hippocampus. Additionally, a 
titanium head plate and light-blocking ring were securely cemented 
to the skull as described in previous protocols28.
Multisensory visual and olfactory virtual reality apparatus
Mice were transported to the experiment room in enclosed dark carts, 
and maintained in darkness with high-volume white noise in the exper-
iment room to minimize external stimuli. Mice were head-fixed on 
a cylindrical treadmill surrounded by a five-monitor virtual reality 
display with visual cues constructed in MATLAB using the ViRMEn 
virtual reality engine64. Additionally, an olfactometer system22,23 was 
utilized for precise odour control throughout the behaviour for the 
odour-controlled mouse groups. Throughout the training and experi-
ments, we controlled for auditory cues by providing a loud white noise 
background and were careful to place the nose cone and lick tube in the 
same location each day to reduce any tactile variability.
In brief, the outlet tubing of the odorant stream led to a 40-ml amber 
glass vial with a rubber membrane cap (Thermo Fisher) containing 
12 ml of odorant solution filled nearly to the top with glass beads. The 
inlet tubing was submerged in the solution. The outlet tubing in the 
head space led to a passive mixing chamber where it met a carrier 
stream of air. The odorant-air mixture flowed through tubing to a 
final nose chamber covering the mouse's snout to create an odour 
micro-environment of 0.07 cm3. Odorant concentration was controlled 
by varying the stream flow rate, with a mass flow controller (MFC), 
between 0.001-0.100 l min−1 to achieve relative odorant concentrations 
between 1% and 100%. Odorant solutions included α-pinene (1:37.5 in 
mineral oil, Sigma-Aldrich) and methyl valerate (1:125 in mineral oil, 
Sigma-Aldrich) or a mix of both (1:18.74 of α-pinene, 1:62.5 of methyl 
valerate in mineral oil, Sigma-Aldrich). A waterspout was placed within 
reach of the mouse's tongue, and a capacitive circuit (Sparkfun) was 
used to register licking and was read through a data acquisition card 
(National Instruments PCI-6229) into MATLAB. All visual cues, MFC 
flow rates, and water rewards were controlled using the ViRMEn virtual 
reality engine in MATLAB. Mice received 4 μl water reward 2/3 (2.25 m) 
of the way along the 3-m virtual track.
Multisensory virtual reality tasks
Uncontrolled odour task. For the uncontrolled odour task, no odour 
and nose chamber were involved in training and experiment days.
Variable visual task. In the variable visual task, brightness was 100% 
on day 1. On day 2, levels of 86%, 93% or 100% were randomly selected 
for each lap. On day 3, levels of 60%, 67% or 74% were used at random, 
and on day 4, 73%, 80% or 87%. On day 5, brightness was fixed at 80%.
Flat odour task. For the flat odour task, α-pinene odorant with 50% of 
its maximum flow rate was delivered to mice through the nose chamber 
during all training and experiment days.
Variable odour task. For the variable odour task, the odorant type and 
concentration was different for each day (Fig. 3c). On day 1, similar to 
the flat odour mice, α-pinene odorant with 50% of its maximum flow 
rate was applied. However, for day 2, the odorant concentration was 
varied on each lap and a randomly chosen 20%, 30% or 40% of α-pinene 
odorant was delivered. On day 3, methyl valerate with random 40%, 50% 
or 60% concentrations on each lap was delivered. On day 4, α-pinene 
with random 70%, 80% or 90% concentrations was delivered. On day 5, 
a mix of α-pinene and methyl valerate with random 40%, 50% and 60% 
concentrations was delivered.
Spatial odour task. For the spatial odour task, the odour concentra-
tion started at 30% at beginning of the track and peaked at the reward 
location (100%) and tapered off afterward reaching to 76% at end of 
the track, allowing mice to integrate enriched sensory information 
and use it to navigate to the reward. This odorant profile was consist-
ent across different laps and days during both training and experiment  
days.
Training criterion
To train mice and determine when to start the five-day imaging experi-
ments, we monitored the speed profile of the mice each day. Mice ini-
tially learned to slow down and lick before the water reward; however, 
we relied on the speed profile of the mice for analysis of behavioural 
stability. There was more behavioural variability when mice were first 
placed on the track and when they became satiated toward the end of 
the sessions, so we focused on the 11th to 30th laps. We constructed 
a reference lap for a particular day by taking the mean speed of the 
mouse in 60 spatial bins across the track. We then used two measures of 
behavioural stability. First, we correlated this reference lap to laps 11-30 
on that day and each preceding day. We identified a mouse as trained 
if the correlation exceeded 0.6 on that day and for at least two of the 
four preceding days. Once these behavioural criteria during training 
were met, we started the imaging experiments for the subsequent five 
days. Mice in five experimental tasks experienced their unique task 
protocols during the training and experiment days.
Two-photon imaging
A custom movable-objective microscope from Sutter Instruments was 
utilized for imaging the hippocampal CA1 through a 40×/0.6 NA air 
objective (LUCPLFLN40x, Olympus) with ScanImage 5.1 software, as 
previously described23,29. Time series movies of 50,000 frames (unidi-
rectional scanning, 31.25 Hz, 512 × 256 pixels movie size) were captured 
during an approximately 27-min behavioural session. A Digidata1440A 
system (Molecular Devices) via Clampex 10.3 software facilitated data 
acquisition, recording, and synchronizing factors such as track posi-
tion, speed, MFC flow rates, licking, reward delivery, and time stamps 
of each two-photon image frame at 1 kHz.
Volumetric plane registration of the same imaging field across 
days
We developed a novel within-session, online pre-experimental, quanti-
tative technique for the longitudinal identification of the same imaging 
plane across days. On the first imaging day, we acquired 1,000 frames 
of the chosen imaging field with 920 nm and isosbestic 800 nm laser 
wavelength, motion-correcting these short videos to obtain average 
images to use as reference templates on subsequent days. In subse-
quent imaging days, we first identified the putative first day imaging 
field qualitatively by visual inspection using previously noted local 
landmarks. Afterward, we identified the precise imaging field quanti-
tatively using the following methods.

For quantitative identification of the same imaging field in the 
following days, we captured 15 z-stack slices (200 frames each) 
with a spacing of 2 μm around the putative field. Each z-stack slice 
was motion-corrected, and the average z-stack slice images were 
obtained. Each average z-stack slice image was then cross-correlated 
(using x and y position offsets) with the first day's template image. 
For cross-correlation, the pixel values of both z-stack slice images 
and the first day's template image were standardized to normalized 
z-scores (centre 0, s.d. 1). To determine the best matching xyz plane, we 
identified the z-stack slice and the associated x,y offsets that resulted 
in the highest peak cross-correlation value. These values therefore 
reported the positional difference in xyz coordinates (in μm) between 
the putative field and the first day's template image. These values 
were then used to finely adjust the objective for imaging of the same 
field as on day 1. With this technique, we quantitatively and robustly 
found the same imaging plane across five imaging days with xyz error 
of around 2 μm.
ROI detection and fluorescence trace extraction
Registration, ROI selection and raw fluorescence trace extraction were 
performed using Suite2p65. Once fluorescence traces were extracted, 
they were converted to ΔF/F traces using the 8th percentile method66 
with a sliding window of 32 s (1,000 frames). Significant transients 
were detected using the ratio of positive- to negative-going transients 
described previously66. After the automatic identification of the 
ROIs, the ROIs were aligned across days using CellReg67. Three authors 
independently evaluated the cellular and subcellular morphologies 
of every individual cell ROI to validate its correct registration across 
days. Only cells that were verified by all three authors were included.
Place cell spatial properties
Fluorescence tuning maps were made by binning the position across 
the track into 80 bins and identifying the mean fluorescence where the 
mouse was moving at a speed of at least 0.1 cm s−1. To test if a cell is a 
place cell, we computed the spatial information (I) in bits per action 
potential for the fluorescence tuning map28,67.

Where f  is the mean change in fluorescence, N is the number of  
bins, fi is the mean fluorescence change in the ith spatial bin, and Px(xi) 
is the probability that the mouse is in the ith spatial bin.
To build a null distribution of information, we circularly shuffled the 
fluorescence trace with a minimum shift of 15 s and recalculated the 
tuning map 1,000 times. A cell was a significant place cell if it had higher 
information than 99% of these shuffle epochs, had an information of 
at least 0.5 bits per action potential, and had at least one significant 
transient during running on at least 1/3 of the laps.
Place cell 'imprecision' was measured as the s.d. of the peak ΔF/F 
location on active laps. Place field distance to reward was defined as 
the mean of distances of place field peaks to the reward location on 
the virtual track.
We defined stable cells as place cells that recurred on 4-5 consecu-
tive days and unstable cells as place cells that recurred for 2 or fewer 
consecutive days and did not recur on the first or the last day.
Quantification of representational drift
To ensure that mice were engaged with the task while we measured 
neural activity, we only used laps where mice slowed before the reward. 
To do this, we compared the speed in 2 different 30-cm zones, one 
just before the reward and the other 70-100 cm from the start of the 
track, where the mice are typically running full speed. We restricted 
our analyses to laps where the mouse was running in the reward zone 
at <50% the speed from the zone earlier on the track. This resulted in 
64.1 ± 2.83 laps used per session out of 77.5 ± 2.46 total laps per session 
(82.3 ± 2.25% of laps included per session).
For within day 1 comparisons, odd and even laps were used. For 
between day comparisons, all (included) laps were used. We used eight 
quantitative measures of representational drift:
(1) Recurrence probability (either place cells only or all active cells).
A cell was considered recurrent between two days if it was active on 
≥1/3 of laps on both days and had a TC correlation >0.4 for place cells. 
This threshold was set via logistic regression, comparing within- 
day TC correlations of place cells to 1,000 randomly paired cells  
(Extended Data Fig. 1i). For stable or unstable place cell classifica-
tion across days (Fig. 4), this measure was used.
For the analysis comparing stable versus unstable cells within the ac-
tive cell population (all cells active for at least 1/3 of laps on both days; 
Extended Data Fig. 10), the TC threshold was determined to be 0.25 
using logistic regression following the same procedure (Extended 
Data Fig. 10a).
(2) PV correlation (all cells).
This measure quantifies how similarly a neuronal population is 
activated by taking the median PV correlation across the track.
(3) TC correlation (place cells only).
This measure correlates each neuron's mean ∆F/F versus position 
(that is, TC) across days. Only cells active on all five days and with 
non-zero variance were included. We further restricted this analysis 
to cells that met the place cell criterion on day 1.
(4) Place field peak shift (place cells only).
For cells active on all five days, the shift in the peak of their TCs 
across days was calculated.
(5) Bayesian decoding error (all cells).
Following a previously described method68, Bayesian decoding was 
performed on the likelihood that a significant transient occurred in 
a 0.1-s bin (Δt). The conditional likelihood that a mouse is in position 
xi given the number of active frames during a time window (n) is:

Where gi,j is the average rate of significant frames by the jth neuron 
in the ith spatial bin, nj is the number of significant frames observed 
during the time window in neuron j, and M is the total number of 
neurons. The Bayesian decoder was trained on day 1 (or day 1 odd laps 
for day 1 analysis) and tested using the same neurons on the day of 
interest (days 2-5; or day 1 even laps for day 1 analysis). The decoded 
position was selected as the one with the maximum conditional 
likelihood. Because the number of neurons significantly impacts the 
quality of decoding, the position was chosen as the average position 
decoded through 100 random samples of 150 neurons: if a mouse 
had fewer than 150 neurons, it was excluded from this analysis. The 
error was determined as the mean absolute error across the session.
(6) Frobenius norm (all cells).
The Frobenius norm of the peak-normalized spatial maps was cal-
culated, then normalized by the square root of the number of cells.
(7) Representational similarity (all cells).
Calculated as the Pearson's correlation coefficient between  
linearized spatial maps, as reported previously6.

we first created a speed vector for each lap that passed the slowdown 
criterion using 60 spatial bins (1 bin = 5 cm). To find the laps that were 
maximally similar across days, we used a particle swarm and cluster-
ing technique. The particle swarm was initialized with all the laps that 
passed the slowdown criterion. For a given particle, we found the 20 
laps on each day that minimized the Euclidean distance of the speed 
vector to that particle. We then computed the mean Euclidean distance 
of these laps to the particle. The swarm was optimized to minimize 
this distance, identifying laps that were similar to each other across 
the five days.
Dissimilar running set. To identify laps that were dissimilar across days 
we maximized the amount of variance explained by the day using the 
particle swarm optimizer. Reference laps were chosen for all 5 days, and 
the 20 laps closest by Euclidean distance within day were identified. We 
then ran a three-way ANOVA across day, position, and their interaction, 
treating each spatial bin as an independent observation. The fraction 
of variance explained by the day (Rday) was taken as:
R
=
SS
+ SS
SS
−SS
day
day
pos×day
tot
pos
Where SSday is the variance explained by the day, SSpos × day is the vari-
ance explained by the position-by-day interaction, SStot is the total 
variance, and SSpos is the variance explained by position. The particle 
swarm optimizer was used to maximize this fraction. The optimizer 
was seeded with 250 pseudo-randomly selected lap sets from each day.
We then validated that the laps identified by this swarm analysis were 
indeed similar or dissimilar by using two ways to quantify the amount 
of behavioural variability. First, to examine how stable the selected 
behavioural laps were within a day, we found the mean correlation of 
the position binned speed vectors on selected laps to the average on 
each day. Second, we used PCA to reduce the speed vector space to three 
dimensions, which contained 63.9 ± 3.5% of the variance. We then took 
the normalized distance between the centre of the laps chosen each day.

Where μa, μb are the centres of the laps chosen on days a and b and Σ 
is the covariance matrix for all laps. The difference score was taken as 
the mean pairwise normalized distance for all combinations of days. 
To generate a shuffle for this distance, 1,000 random pairs of laps were 
chosen, and the normalized pairwise distance was calculated.
Most selective and non-selective pre-lick behaviours
We quantified the degree of pre-licking per lap using a pre-lick index34, 
calculated as the difference between the average lick rate in the 30 cm 
before the reward site and the average lick rate on the rest of the track, 
divided by their sum. For the most selective pre-lick set, we used the 
20 laps with the highest scores above 0. For the non-selective set, we 
used up to 20 laps with scores below 0. Mice were included only if they 
had at least 10 non-selective pre-lick laps on day 1 (to allow even-odd 
comparisons) and 5 on subsequent days.
Internal TCs
To compare internal structure to spatial tuning we created internal 
TCs. First, significant transient traces were binarized and then were 
mapped onto the first four dimensions using the non-linear dimen-
sionality reduction algorithm Laplacian eigenmaps69 as described47. 
These data were clustered into ten states using k-means clustering. No 
sub-clustering was performed. The order of states was defined using 
a transition matrix algorithm described47, with the exception that the 
'first' state was determined as the state with median timestamp closets 
to the start of trial, and that the direction of movement through the 
states was determined as the direction which maximized the correlation 
between state and time since start of trial. Significant state cells were 
identified as having significant state information (see 'Place cell spatial 
properties') although no minimum threshold of information was used. 
Significant cells were sorted according to their state peak during epochs 
that corresponded to odd trials, and TC maps were made for the even 
trials. These were visually compared with spatial maps made from the 
full running epochs with the same cell selection and sorting criterion.
Imaging signal quality measures
Baseline noise was estimated using the standard deviation of the ΔF/F 
trace outside of significant transients. Baseline fluorescence was cal-
culated as the average extracted fluorescence in the first 10 s of the 
recording outside of significant transients, normalized by the median 
intensity of the mean imaging field.
Logistic regression
We computed several potential predictors of place cell stability (Supple-
mentary Table 2). Because some of the predictors followed lognormal 
distributions70, they were first transformed into log space. Moreover, 
before training the model all data were standardized. To identify the 
best predictors of place cell stability, we used an elastic net logistic 
regression approach71. First, we randomly chose 100 stable and 100 
unstable cells to be held out of training. We used class weights to coun-
terbalance the number of observations in each class in the training 
data set. We used a grid search of 200 λ values between 10−6 and 106 on 
a logistic scale and 100 α values between 0 and 1, selecting the values 
with the lowest deviance under fivefold cross-validation in the training 
set. To test model performance, we used predicted values above 0.5 as 
stable and measured the accuracy of the predictions on the held-out 
data in a balanced test set (number of correct predictions per number 
of held-out data points). We then completed this whole procedure 50 
times, with random seeds each time, in order to generate multiple trials.
Quantification and statistical analysis
The data were analysed using custom MATLAB codes, and imaging 
files were viewed in ImageJ 1.53k. Sample sizes were not predetermined 
statistically, and the experimenter was aware of the experimental tasks. 
Inclusion criteria were based on the behavioural metrics detailed in 
the Methods section. Non-parametric and parametric statistical tests 
were used as indicated in the main text and methods. We have reported 
statistical parameters, such as the precise value and interpretation 
of n, precision indicators (represented as mean or median ± s.d. or 
s.e.m.), and the establishment of statistical significance, in both the 
main text and accompanying figure legends. The significance threshold 
was set at P < 0.05. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine 
sample sizes, but sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous 
publications.
Where appropriate, data was cross-validated by comparing results 
from odd and even trials (Figs. 1k, 2g,h, 3i-k and 4d,e,n,o and Extended 
Data Figs. 4e,f, 5b-d, 6g and 10b,c). All experiments were replicated in 
multiple individual mice, with the number of mouse replicates listed 
throughout the manuscript for each experiment. Further, data were 
grouped and compared either by session or by mouse (across sessions) 
to ensure that they were representative across sessions and across mice.
The same experiments and measures were made for each behaviour 
group studied with imaging experiments. We did not attempt to rand-
omize these allocations, as experiments targeting each group were per-
formed in batches and all mice across groups were trained to the same 
behaviour criteria; however, in some cases we allocated littermates 
to different behaviour groups (for example, flat odour and variable 
odour) and trained and imaged them in parallel and at least qualitatively 
observed results that were consistent with our larger cohort.

Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the con-
ditions of the experiments. This was not possible to do for odour- 
controlled versus uncontrolled groups because one required use of 
the olfactory virtual reality system (and all the procedures related to 
that system) and the other did not, so there was no practical way to 
blind the experimenter.
