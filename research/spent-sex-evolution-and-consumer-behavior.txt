Darwin Goes to the Mall 
CONSUMERIST CAPITALISM: it is what it is, and we shouldn't pre-
lend otherwise. 
8m what ]$ iI, really> Consumerism is hard to describe when it's 
the ocean and were the plankton. 
Faced 'With the unfathomable, we could start by asking some fresh 
questions. Beres one: Why would the world's most intel1igenl primate 
buy a Hummer HI Alpha sport-utility vehicle for $139,77l? It is not a 
practical mode of transport. [t seats only four, needs fifty-one feet in 
which to turn around, burns a gallon of gas every ten miles, dawdles 
from 0 to 60 mph in 135 seconds, 
has poor reliability, according 
to Consumer Reports. Yet, some people have felt the need to buy It-as 
the Hummer ads say, "Need is a very subjective word." 
Although common sense says we buy things because we think we'll 
enjoy owning and using them, research shows that the 
of 
acquisltion are usually short-lived at best. So why do we keep ourselves 
on the consumerist treadmill-working, buying, aspjring~ 
Biology offers an answer. Humans evolved in small social groups 
in which image and status were all-important, not on I)' for survival, 
but for attracting mates, impressing friends, and rea.ring children. 
Today we ornament ourselves with goods and services more to make 
an impression on other people's minds than (0 enjoy owning a chunk 
of matter-a fact tbat renders "materialism" a profoundly misleading 
term for much of consumption. Many products are signals first and 
material objects second. Our vast social-primate brains evolved to pur-
sue one central social goal: to look good in the eyes of others. Buying 
impressive products in a money-based economy is just the most recent 
way 10 fulfill that goal.

Many bright thinkers have tried to understand modern consumer-
ism by framing it in a historical context, asking, for example: How 
did we go from showing off our status with purple-bordered togas in 
ancient Rome to showing it off with Franck MuHer watches in mod-
em Manhattan') How did we go from the 1908 black Model-T Ford 
to the 2006 "Flame Red Pearl" Hummer? How did we go from eat-
ing canned tuna (about $4 per pound) to eating magical plankton 
("marine phytoplankton, the ultimate nutrogenomic, supercharged 
with high-YibratlOn crystal scalar energy healing frequencies"-$168 
for fifry grams, or $1,525 per pound, from Ascendedhealth.com) as a 
luxury food? 
This book takes a different approach from that of historical anal-
ysis, It frames consumerism in an evolutionary context) 
thus 
addresses changes aCross much longer spaDS of time. How did we go 
from being small-brained semisocial primates 4 million years ago to 
being the big-brained hypersncial humans we are today) At the same 
time it addresses differences aCross species. \'\'h.y do we pay so much 
for plankton. tbe most common form of biomass on the planet? Blue 
whales eat fOllf tons of it per day, wbich would cost $]2.2 million per 
day (pJllS shipping) from Ascendedhealth.com, if they wanted the 
"nutrogenomic supercharging." 
To understand consumerist capitalism, it might help to begin by 
considering our liyes today as our prehistoric anCeS1DrS might view 
them. What would they think of liS? Compared with their easygoing 
clannish ways, our frenetic status seeking and product hunting would 
look bewildering indeed. Our society would seem noisy, perplex-
mg. 
maybe psychotic. To see just how psychotic, iet's perfonn a 
thought experiment-something exotic, with time travel and lasers. 
From Cro-Magnons to Consumers 
This is your miSSion, should you choose to accept it: Go back thirty 
thousand years in a time machine_ Meet some clever Cro-Magnons 
in prehistoric' France, (\Ve'll ,1SSUl11e that rOll'll be .bk to speak thdr

language, somehow.) Explain our modern system of consumerist capi-
talism to them. Find out what they think of it. Would the prospect of 
ever-greater prosperity, leisure. a.nd knowledge motivate them to invent 
agriculture, animal husbandry, walled towns, money, social classes, 
and conspicuous consumption) Or would they prefer to stagnate at 
their Aurignacian level of culture, knapping flint and painting caves? 
Suppose you agree to this mission, and go back in your time machine. 
You find somo Cm-Mags one evening, and get their attention by passing 
out a dozen laser pointers for them to play around with. After an hour 
they settle down, and rou give your pitch, explaining that our culture 
offers a vast cornucopia of goods and services for showing off one's per· 
sonal qualities in ten thousand new ways to millions of strangers. One 
acquires these displays of personal merit br "buying" them with "money" 
C<lmed through "skilled labor." You promise that if they persist with their 
nint-knapping obsession, then in just a few millennia their descendanLs 
will be able to enjoy sophisticated cu ltural innovations, such as colonic 
irrigation and YouTube. 
Your talk goes well, and it's time to gauge their reaction. You take 
some questions from the audience. One of the dominant adult males, 
Gerard, has been hooting with enthUSiasm, and seems to get the idea. 
But Gerard has some concerns-most sound outrageously sexist to 
your modem ears, but since they are expresse.d with genuine curiosity, 
in the spirit of scientific objectivity you feel obliged to answer them 
honestly. Gerard inquires: 
So, Man-from-Future, with this money stuff, I could huy twenl y 
bright young women willing to bear my children 0 
You; No, Gerard. Since the abolition of slavery, we can't offer genuine 
reproductive success in the form of fertile mates for sale. There 
are prostilutes, but they tend to use contraception. 
GERARD: Well, J shall have to seduce the women so they want to 
breed with me. Cnn J huy marc intelligence and charisma, better 
"bilil it'S to Ie'! I stori"s illld jokes, more height and muscularity?

SPE NT 
YOU: No, but you can buy self-help hooks that have S0111e placebo 
effect, and some steroids that increase both rnusde mass and irri-
tability by 30 percent. 
GtRARO: OK, I will be patient and wait for my sexual rivals to die. 
Can I buy anot her hundred years of Ii fe? 
You: No, hut with amazing modern health care, your expected life 
span can increase from seventy years to seventy-eight years, 
GtRARO: These no-answers anger me, and I feel aggressive. Can I 
buy advanced weaponry to kiD my rivals, especially that bastard 
Serge, and the men of other kin groups and clans, so I can steal 
t heir women? 
YOu: Yes. One effective choice would he the Auto Assault-12 shot-
gun, which can fire nve high-explosive fragmenting antipersonnel 
rounds per second. Oh-but I guess then the rivals and other kin 
groups and clans would probably buy them, too. 
GERARD: So, we'd end up at just another level of clan-versus· clan 
detente. And there would be mote lethal fights among hotheaded 
male teens within our clan. Then I shaU be content with mv CUI-
rent mate, Gisell.e--can I buy her undying devotion. and mt;'tip]e 
orgasms so she never cheats 011 me? 
YOU: Well, actually, lovers still cheat lmder capitalism; paternity 
uncertajnty persists. 
GERARD: 'VVhat about Giselle's mother and sister-can] buy them 
kinder personalities, so they are 
cribcal of m" foil)le,;) 
Yov: Sadly, no. 
. 
Then Giselle, Gerard's savvy mate, interrupts With a few questions of 
her own, which you answer with ever~increasjng dismay: 
GISEU .. E: Man-from-Future, can I buy a handsome, high-status, 
channing lover who will never ignore me, beat me, or leave me? 
You: No, Giselle. but we Can offer romance novels that describe fic-
tional adventures with such lovers. 
GJSELLE: Can I buy more siste,", who will care f<JJ my younger

children as they would their own, when I am away gathering 
goose berries' 
You: No. child-care employees tend to be underpaid, overwhelmed, 
miseducated girls who care more about text messaging their 
friends than looking after the children of strangers. 
G,seLLE: How about our teenage children-Justme and Phillipeo 
Can I buy their respect and obedience, and the taste to choose 
good mates) 
You: No. marketers ,,~Il brainwash them to ignore your social "isdam 
and to have sex with anyone wearing Hollister-branded clothing 
or drinking Mountain Dew AMP Energy Overdrive. 
GISELLE: Zut, alorS! Mange de la merde et ",eu1'51 This money stuff 
sounds useless. Can I at least buy a mammoth carcass that never 
rots? 
Finally, you see an opening, and you start explainJng about Sub-Zero 
freezers-but then you remember that there is not yet an Electricite 
de France with fifty-nine nuclear reactors to supply freezer power, and 
you falter. 
Giselle and Gerard are by now giving you looks of withering con-
tempt. The rest of your audience is restless and skeptical; some even 
try to set you on fire "'~th their laser pointers. You try to rekindle their 
interest by explaining all the camping conveniences that consumer-
ism offers for the upwardly mobile Cro,,/>"1ag: sunglasses, steel knives, 
backpacks, and trail-running shoes that last several months, with cool 
swooshes on the sides. 
The audience perks up a bit, and Giselle's mother, Juliette, asks, 
"So, what's the catch:> \Vhat would we have to do to get these knJves 
and shoes?" You explain, "All you have to do is sit in classrooms every 
day for sixteen years to learn counter.intujtive skills, and then work and 
commute fifty hours a week for forty years in tedious jobs for amoral 
corporations, far away from relatives and friends, without any decent

By envisioning our CUTrent lives through our ancestors' eyes, we 
can see more clearly what we have given up, and what we have gained, 
from developing this thing called "civilization," which nowadays means 
consumenst capitalism, We can also better distinguish what is truly 
natural about our lives from what is historically accidental, culturally 
arbitrary, or politically oppressive, 
Consumerist capitalism, as humans practice it in any particular 
culture, is not a natural Or inevitable outcome of human evolution, 
given a certain level of technological sophistication. An evolutionary-
psychology analysis of consumerism is accordingly not a way of giving 
science's seal of approval to consumerism, nor is it a way of morally 
justifying consllmerism as the highest possihle stage of hiocultural

progress, Many thinkers have tried to "naturalize" consumerism in that 
way, including most social Darwinists, Austrian School economists 
(Ludwig van Mises, Friedrich Hayek, Murray Rothbard), Chicago 
School economists (George Stigler, Milton Friedman, Gary Becker), 
Darwinian libertarians, globalization advocates, management gurus, 
and marketers, Their model (which I cal! the Wrong Conservative 
Model, because I think it's wrong, and because 
usually advocated 
by political conservatives) is; 
human nature + free markets = consumerist capitalism 
Against such attempts to "naturalize" consumerism, others have 
rejected any concept of "human nature" 
any connection between 
biology and economics, These bio-skeptics include most Marxists, 
anarchists, hippies, utopians, New Age sentimentalists, gender femi-
nists, cultural anthropologists, SOciologists, postrnodernists, and anti-
globalization activists, For now, suffice it to say that such radicals 
propose the Wrong Radical Model, which is basically: 
the blank slate + oppressive institutions + invidious ideologies = 
consumerist capitalism 
Here, the "blank slate" means a human baby's big brain, allegedly 
born without any evolved instincts, preferences, or adaptations, yet 
capable of learning anything_ (Steven Pinker trenchantly critiqued the 
possibility of such a brain in his book TIze Blank Slate) The "oppres-
sive instltutions'" are usuaUy taken to be governments, corporations, 
schools, and media, as they inevitably represent tbe interests of some 
ruling class, 
"invidious ideologies" are usually assumed to include 
religion, patriarchy, conformism, elitism, ethnocentrism, and main-
stream economics, The Wrong Radical Model also usua:ly assumes 
that Darwinism was invented as a justification for Victorian-era capi-
talism, including Chl$sism, colonialism, sexism, and racisrn~-mld if it's

As an alternative to the \;Vrong Conservative Model (consumerism 
as natural) and the Wrong Radical Model (consumerism as cultural 
oppression), this book proposes something a bit more complicated but, 
r hope, more accurate, I call it the SensibJe Model, because I think 
it's pretty reasonable, given what science has discovered so far about 
people and societies, It goes like this: 
human instincts for trying unconsciously to display certain 
deSirable personal traits 
+ current social norms for displaying those mental traits through 
certain kinds of credentials, jobs, goods, and services 
+ current technological abilities and constraints 
+ certain social institutions and ideologies 
+ historical acddent and cultural inertia 
early twenty-first-century consumerist capitalism 
This more complex (but still vastly oversimplified) model does not just 
"denaturalize" consumerism, It also identifies specific things we could 
change about society by changing our social nomlS, institutions, ide-
ologies, cultures, and technologies, The last third of this book suggests 
some possible ways to reengineer consumerist capitalism based on the 
Sensible ModeL 
These suggested changes will not aim to restore Cra-Magnan liv-
ing conditions, which would be neither possible nor desirable for mod-
ern humans, There are 6,7 billion people on earth, and we can't all 
go back to Hving as hunter-gatllerers, The notion of returning to an 
ideali2en paradise of simple, gentle, small-group living has been advo-
cated by diverse visionaries throughout history: Buddha, Laozi, 
rus, Thoreau, Engels, Gandhi, Margaret Mead, and the U nabomber. 
Often these visionaries attract followers, who form religions, political 
movements, or whole cultures; Taoists, Shakers, Luddites, Marxists, 
anarchists, hippies, and Emo kids, Even mainstream "bourgeOis bohe-
mians" support suslninabilily, voluntary simplicity, intentional living, 
organic l;lTming, and tOfporate sodal responsibility, and try to smul!1<le

some aspects of eco-communo-primitivism into their galed communi-
ties, insofar as local 
permits them. 
Yet each of these individuals and groups has exaggerated both the 
pros of primitive life and the cons of modern life. Each intuits cor. 
rectly that a ero-Magnon lifestyle was a morc natural environment 
for the human body, mind, family, and clan. Yet at the same time, 
each forgets that, stripped of romantic idealization, ero-Magnon life 
was also ignorant, insular, violent, and unimaginably boring. I would 
not want to live without eiv! lualion's key inventions-trade, currency, 
literacy, medicine, books, bicycles, films, ducl tape, shipping contain-
ers, and computers_ Unlike many malcontents, I consider the three 
best inventions of 
time to be money, markets, and media. Each has 
radically increased the social and material benefits of peaceful human 
cooperatjon_ But together they don't necessarily add up to consumerist 
capitalism in its current forms, 
Fortunately, we are not forced to make an either-or choice berween 
(1) eco'communo-primiti\ism as it might function in some elusive 
utopia, and (2) consumerist capitalism as it happens to have metas-
tasized so far in some human societies_ The Sensible Model suggests 
that there are many alternatives, and I think some of them combine 
the best natural features of prehistoric life and the best inventions of 
modem life.

a bizarre new world of frustrating duties and counterintuitive Ideas: sit 
still, learn math, find a job, mOve away from friends, ignore kin, drive 
cars, leave kids in day care, and grow burdensome in old age. 
Children face this new world "'ith minimal guidance. Their parents 
go away all day to make money, to buy things, to look good and spe-
cial, and to attract extra attention from other men and women, despite 
ha>ing mated and reproduced already. Their parents can't explain why 
they pretend that they're still in the mating market if they don't actu, 
aUv want a divorce 
custody battle. Their high school teachers can't 
m~ke sense of the consumerist world for them either, and their college 
professors can only suggest reading perplexing rants from postmod, 
ern French SOciologists, such as Jean Baudrillard. So, almost everyone 
grows up confused, passes through life contused, and dies confused. 
Only a few children do ever gain an intuitive grasp of consum-
erism's principles, and these typically grow up to be marketing con-
sultants. They learn that people in general are motivated, at least 
unconsciously, to flaunt and rake their personal merits and virtues to 
one another. They realize that modern consumers in particular strive 
to he self-marketing minds, feetting one another hyperbole about how 
healthy, dever, and popular they are, through the goods and ser,ices 
they consume. Marketing consultants build careers around the post-
modern inSight; at its heart consumerist capitalism is not "material-
" but "semiotic." It concerns mainl,., the psychological world of 
signs, symbols, images, and brands, not the physical world of tangible 
commodities, Marketers understand that they are selling the sizzle, 
not the steak, because a premium brand of sizzle yields a high mar-
gin of profit, whereas a steak is just a low-margin commodity that any 
butcher could sell 
However, even the cleverest marketers still don't fully understand 
which merits and virtues consumers are really trying to display through 
their consumption decisions. They don't really understand the content

then the), get real jobs at real companies and realize that their formal 
training is mostly useless in selling real products. In response, they 
strive to develop an intuitive understanding of consmner behavior and 
marketing strategies through years of trial-and-error learning, plus the 
occasional book by Seth Godin or IVlalcolm Gladwell. They lack the 
huge practical benefits of having a coherent evidence-based theory 
about consumer behavior, and this limits their success rate. 
In particular, most marketers still use simplistic models of human 
nature that remain uninformed by the past twenty years of rescarch on 
human nature-research by evolutionary anthropologists, evolution-
ary biologists, and evolutionary psycholOgists. Marketers still believe 
that premium products are bought to display wealth, status, and taste, 
and they miss the deeper mental traits that people are actually wired 
to display-traits such as kindness, intelligence, and creatiVity. They 
don't put consumption in its evoilltionary context, or trace its prehis-
toric roots, or understand its adaptive functions, As a result, they don't 
have access to a good map of the human mind, or of this brave new 
semiotIC world in which it dwells. \Vhat marketers need is Darwin. 
Yet Darwin, in turn, needs to take a break from fieldwork and visit 
the mall, The Darwinian science of human nature needs to shift some 
attention from Pleistocene evolution to twenty-first-century COnsumer 
beha\·ior. \Ve need to understand in much deeper ways how people 
flaunt and fake their biological firness-their prospects for survival 
and reproduction-.. ·-l.o one another. We need to understand the spe' 
cific facets of fitness-the most important physical and psychological 
traits· that people strive to display t hwugh t heir "fitness indicators," 
including most of the products they buy.

damental biological traits sllch as good genes, good health, and good 
social intelligence. 
The animals that possess them are not consciously aware that these 
traits evolved to adverrise their litness. They just have the genes and 
instincts for displaying them, and evolution itself keeps track of the 
survival, social, and sexual beneHts of doing so. We humans may not 
have much more conscious insight into 
biological functions of Our 
fitness indicators than guppies have into the functions of their Ilaglike 
tails. Indeed, we oftcn buy products that increase our apparent fimess 
(health, beauty, fertility, intelligence) at the cost of real biological fit-
ness (reproduction)-for example, Ortbo TriCyclen birth control pills 
make women's skin look more attractive by reducing acne, but it low-
ers reproductive success by eliminating ovulation OUf brains did not 
evolve to pursue reproductive success consciously, but to pursue the 
cues, experiences, people, and things that typically led to reproductive 
success under ancestral conditions. 
Successful reproduction requires males and females to follow dif· 
ferent sexual strategies, and to display their fitness indicators to dif-
ferent audiences. Across virtually all animal species, males display 
mostly [0 attract female mates, and less often to intimidate male sex-
lIat rivals. It is easy to see the functional connection between peacock 
!nils and porsches, and many recent studies have confirmed that men 
increase the conspicuousness of their consumption ,,,,hen they are 
most interested in mating. The situation is mOre complex for females. 
Female animals of most species gain little benefit from displaying fit-
ness indicators to either sex, except in species where females com-
pete for reSources and mates, Of where males are selective about their 
mates. Among the highly social great apcs, for example, female Sla-
IllS hierarchies alX' imporlant in predicting female access to food, so

female apes often compete for status by displaying fitness indicators to 
one another-such as their size, heald" assertiveness, and popularity 
during mutual grooming, Such female-versus-female status competi-
tion probably likewise accounts for most conspicuous conswnption by 
human females, especially for products such as Prada handbags and 
Manalo Blahnik shoes, which straight males rarely notice, Humans 
are even more distinctive in that males are 
choosy about the 
fema les \I~th whom they form long-term relationships, which means 
that females also compete to attract the higher-quality males, Sadly, 
the evidence so far suggests that men pay very little attention to such 
conspicuous consumption by WOmen, 
Unlike other animals, humans have evolved unique abilities to 
invent, 
display, and imitate new kinds of fitness indicators, 
These new indicators evolve at the cultural rather than genetic level, 
and they include many uf the credentials, jobs, goods, and services 
that are typical. in modem economies, Juvenile humans have an insa-
tiable thIrst to learn about culture-specific indicators, gossiping end, 
lessly about what is "cool:' "hot," "phat:' "rad," or "wicked." In other 
words, they are trying to diseern "Which products would display my 
traits, tastes, and skills most effectively, given the current display tac' 
tics favored by my peer group, especially its more socially and sexually 
attractive members)" If local status depends On memorizing longer 
passages of the TOTah or Qur'an than others can, young people will 
learn to do that; if it depends on getting higher "interestingness" scores 
On one's FIlckr-posted photos, or a higher friend-count on Facebook, 
or higher "hotness" ratings on Hotornot.com, they will opt for those 
instead, Just as toddlers have special brain systems that evolved to 
learn whatever language is spoken locally, teens seem to have evolved 
similar systems to learn whatever culture-specific fitness indicators 
are favored in their local eeo-niche, social niche, or market niche, We 
are not just intuitive linguists; we are also intuitive status-ticians. In 
each case, evolution has crafted Ollr innate ability to acquire culturally 
modulated communication skills. 
In humans, fitness indicators arc unlikdy 10 have evolved to

advertise monetary wealth, career-based status, or avant-garde taste, 
because these phenomena arose guite recently on the evolutionary 
timescale, within the past ten thollsand years. Rather, the 
traits 
that we strive to display are the stable traits that differ most between 
individuals and that most strongly predict our social abilities and pref-
erences, These include physical traits, such as health, fertility, and 
beamy; personality traits, 
as conscientiousness, agreeableness, 
and openness to noveltv; and cognitive traits, such as general intel-
ligence, These are the biological virtues that peop.!e try to broadcast, 
with the unconscious function of attracting respect, love, and support 
from friends, mates, and allies. Displaying such traits is 
key "latent 
motive" that marketers strive to comprehend, \Vhile consumers do 
strive semiconsciously to show off their wealth, status, and taste, I'll 
an>ue that they do so largely in order to reveal these more fundamental 
bi:logical virtues, 
money can function as a form of "liquid 
fitness:' but largely as a means of acquiring more conspicuolls fitness 
indicators, And while consumers do rely more on emotions than on 
reason in deciding what to buy, buman emotions cannot be described 
clearly without understanding their evolutionary origms and functions, 
Until marketers and consumers understand these principles deeply, in 
vjvid Technicolor detail, and with a blttersweet ambivalence about the 
human condition, we will have little hope of improving and enlighten-
ing society, 
Description and Prescription 
This book has two main aims, 
first is to describe our human 
culture as it is, within a biological context. The second is to suggest 
some ways that we could change our human culture so it more hap-
pily combines the best features of prehistoriC social life and modern 
!('c!mology, 
Inevitably, my descriptions and prescriptions \vill get mixed 
together in the course of my discussion, They will interlace at every

as I shift between considering facts and values, Such promiscuous 
hybridizations of "is" and "ought" often provoke outrage among the 
superhumanly rational philosophers of science and morality, who pre-
fer that behavioral scientists restrict themselves to objective reportage 
and leave the preaching to them, or to their religious counterparts, 
Too bad, There is a distinguished tradition of gaining new prescriptive 
insights into one's society through new ways of describing its follies and 
injustices~a tradition that mcludes such names as John Locke, Mary 
Wollstonecraft, Daniel Defoe, Wilham vVilberforce, Henry David 
Thoreau, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Margaret Sanger, Thorstein Veblen, 
John Kenneth GalbraIth, Alfred Kinsey, Germaine Greer, and Peter 
Singer. I hope to scramble along 
a dormouse in their footsteps, 
If my descriptive analYSis proves accurate, it should be useful to 
different readerships with conflicting agendas, It should give market-
ers new ways to explott consumer preferences and make more money, 
It should also give consumers new ways to resist marketer influence 
and save mone)', It may give conservatives new ways to justify some 
aspects of the statns quo, given the ubiquity of conspicuous display 
throughout nature, It may also 
progressives new ways to under-
mine that status quo, given 
colossal inefficiency of conspiCUOUS 
consumption as a form of trait display. Vi/hi Ie I can't control who reads 
this book, what insights the)' derive from it, or how they apply those 
insights in their lives and livelihoods, I can hope that a more accurate 
view of human nature and consumerist culture leads to mOre intelli-
gent debate about all its relevant issues, 
Consumerist Ambivalence

Mall of America, fast food, cable television, Hummers, and overpriced

Bangkok You can draw up your own lists, and contemplate your own 
sources of consumerist ambivalence, 
Unfortunately, most writing about consumerism shows either pure 
love or pure hate, with no balance or nuance, On the one hand, we 
have pro-consumerism advocacy: the World Trade Organrzation, World

The Genius of Marketing 
THE TALE OF ALADorN, from the 1,001 Arabian Nights, offers a 
serviceable metaphor for consumerism, The poor hoy Aladdin discov 
crs a magic lamp in a secret cave, \Nhen he rubs the lamp, he releases 
a terrifying but powerful Genius ("genie," colloquially), This Genius 
of the Lamp grants Aladdin many wishes-rich food on silver plates, 
embroidered clothes, fine horses, the intimidation of a sexual rival (the 
Grand 
forty gold basins, and a marble palace set with 
jasper, gold, and 
In Aladdin's case, the reproductive payoffs of 
releasing and 
the Genius are real: he wins the love of a prin-
cess and sires a long line of kings, 
In the modern world, the market is the Genius, and its products 
embody our Wishes, though the biological payoffs in this case are less 
clear. The market holds a mirror up to our desires, creating public 
manifestations of om private preferences. Like the Genius of the 
Lamp, the market seemS both magical and manic in its potency and 
ingenuity, Through many cycles of market research, conswner feed-
back, and economic competition, the market, like the Genius, also 
makes enormous efforts to fulfill our stated wishes-but often, like 
I he 
it obeys the letter rather than the spirit of those wishes, 
with frustfllting consequences, 
Marketing has already transformed our world more dramatically 
I han the Genius transformed AJaddin's. Thirty thousand years ago,

environment. There were rocks, trees, insects 7 and stars-an ornery

I ury, ill least for educated eliles in rich countries, consumer capitalism 

20 
S PENT 
has profoundly reshaped OUf environment to reflect our wishes. So, 
to understand the nature of our wishes, we need only look out at the 
world and see what it says about us. The wodd of goods, services, 
advertisements, media, and entertainment is a rich sourCe of evidence 
about what people want~vr at least about the products that people 
think they want. 
Roughly, products fall into twO overlapping categories: (I) things 
that display our desirable traits and bring us 
when others see 
that we own them, and (2) things that push our pleasure buttons and 
bring us satisfaction even if no one else knows we have them. This 
book focuses on the first category, the status products, which reveal 
human instincts for displaying various traits to others. Analyzing such 
products can even help uS discern the nature of the human traits they 
are designed to display. For instance, to better understand the trait of 
human intelligence, we can go beyond traditional IQ tests, and analyze 
ways that bright consumers acquire educational credentials (Oxford 
MAs, Harvard MBAs) as intelligence displays. To better understand 
the trait of human altruism, we can go beyond experimental economic 
studies of the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and Ultimatum Came. 
and analyze the ways some consumers unconsciously display their 
kindness by driving their Toyota Camry hybrids to their local organic 
food co-ops to pick up their Fair Trade shade-grown coffee. !'or ",-erl' 
aspect of human nature, for every dimension of variation in human 
personality, intelligence, virtues. and values, there exists a vast market 
of prodllct sets that we can draw from to broadcast our personal traits 
to others. 
The same reasoning applies to pleasure products. To understand 
our aesthetic tastes, we can go beyond laboratory research on \'isual 
preferences, and examine the clothes and carS designed to attract the 
human eye. To understand male sexual psychology, we can do more 
than ask men what they're willing to say they want; we can also ana-
lyze the ways that female sex workers have learned to maximize their 
earnings by looking and acting in certain ways. Many evolutionary 
The Genius of Marketing 
21 
psychologists have already been working for years to better understand 
human tasteS and preferences by analyzing such pleasure products; 
the status products remain much more mysterious. 
To understand how human status seeking plays out in consumer-
ist capitalism, we need a new way of thinking about the human con-
dition. one that goes beyond conventional science and conventional 
ideas about consumerism. Most writing about consumerism assumes 
that culture shapes human nature, so that our desires conform to the 
dictates of advertising, through socialization and learning. This is the 
heart of postmodernist cultural theory. Much of evolutionary psy-
chology tends to work in the same direction, from the outside in, as 
Darwinians consider how the external challenges of prehistoric living 
wou!dhave shaped our thoughts and feelings L~rough genetic evolution. 
Both postmodernists and Darv.1nians agree that our minds conform to 
the external em'ironmem, through either cultural or biological adapta-
tion. I try to work in the complementary direction, from the inside out. 
[ argue that we have inherited a rich human nature from our ances-
tors, full of desires and preferences for seeking status and lmpress-
others. I recognize that we have a

to trace how our internal status-seeking instincts get 
refracted through consumerist culture to produce the products, mar-
kets, and lifestyles that constitute our modern environment. 
A deeper understanding of human nature helps everybody, whether 
we are cOnsumers trying to live a morc fulfilling life, or marketers try-
i Ilg to increase brand recognition and market share, or scientists trying 
10 understand the world, or activists trying to improve society. Indeed, 
new insights into human nature have provoked every other major revo-
IUlion in the classiealliberal tradition of evidence-based enlightenment: 
Ihe Protestant Refonnation, the American Revolution, the abolition 
of slavery, and the women's movement. Those democratic revolutions 
rclormulated the relationships between governors and citizens, but 

22 
S PEN r 
with the spread of free-market capitalism, business-consumer relation-
ships have become much more important. What democracy is to poli-
tics, consumer demand is to business: the fulcrum with which ordinary 
people have the most leverage on how their world is organized, Spent 
is therefore not just a book about business or psychology; it concerns 
the most important issue that confronts a free-market society--how to 
make the economy work for us, rather than vice versa, 
Beyond Maslow 
If we want to understand our behavior as consumers, it helps to 
remember that we evolved as social primates competing for mates, 
friends, family support, and statUS, Throughout most of the twentieth 
century, psychologists assumed that this biological legacy gave us just 
a few simple instincts to survive and reproduce, and that everything 
else was due to learning and culture, Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, 
and B, F Skinner had some great inSights, but they did not integrate 
Darwin's legacy into human psychology, This Darwinization has taken 
place only since about 1990, In the field of evolutionary psychology, 
and it has yielded a picture of human nature much richer than a short 
list of simple instincts, 
EvolutlOnary psychology reaches all the way into our most cherished 
abilities and asplfations, explaining why we care about friendship, 
love, family, social status, self-respect, moral virtue, and authentiCity. 
It explains much mOrc than merely why "sex sells:' It also explains why 
empathy and extraversion are sexually attractive, and whywe are moti-
vated to buy mobile phones that reveal our popularity, and pets that 
reveal our kindness and conscientiousness, It has demonstrated a set 
of human motivations and aspirations vastly morc detailed, nuanced, 
and principled than the "hierarchy of needs" posited by Abraham 
Maslow in the 1950s, which remains the dominant model of human 
motivation in consumer-behavior textbooks, 
Maslow's hierarchy includes just seven ty'pBs of human needs, 
elLlsttred into two <'atq;ori<:s, "f)eficiency needs" arc driws to roduce

states of deficiency or discomfort, and are pursued only when a defi-
ciency arises, They include: 
• physiological needs: breathing, drinking, eating, excreting, 
regulating temperature, having sex 
• safety needs: health, well-being, familiarity, predictability, 
personal security, financial security, insurance 
• social needs: family, friendship, intimacy, sexcallove, 
belonging, acceptance 
• esteem needs: recognition, status, fame, glory, self-respect, 
self-esteem 
"Growth needs" are drives toward "transcendence:' and are pursued 
whenever the individual is free to do so, They include: 
• cognitive needs: fa learn, explore, discover, creatc, acquire 
knowledge, and increase intelligence 
• aesthetiC needs: to experience beauty as found in nature, 
people, or artifacts 
• self-actualization needs: to fulfill one's potential and make the 
most of one's abilities 
hom an evolutionary viewpoint, Maslow's hierarchy is hopelessly 
muddled, It mixes innate drives (breathing, eating, seeking status, 
ocquiring knowledge) and learned concerns (seeking financial secu-
rH y, self-esteem, and increased intelligence), It does not "cut nature 
III the joints" in terms of the key selection pressures that shaped 
human behavior survival and reproduction. Survival includes most of 
Maslow's physiological needs (breathing, eating), but also some of the 
lI10re concrete safety needs (avoiding harm from predators, parasites, 
"'Xlwl rivals, and hostile tribes), social needs (building relations "'~th 
ramily, friends, and mates who can help feed, protect, and heal you 
under ildv(~r$C' conditions), cognitive needs (to Icurn about survival-
iller""s;,,)!, orrorllll1iti<'s nnd survivi1l-r",llIcing t1al1Rcrs), ,md even 

24 
S PENT 
aesthetic needs (to find a propitious landscape for one's dan to live in, 
to make weapons that are sen'iceably symmetric, strong, and sharp), 
Reproductive challenges, includi ng find ing high-quality sexual partners 
and raising high-quality offspring, encompass one of the key physiologi-
cal needs (having sex) and most of the other social, esteem, cognitive, 
aesthetic, and se]f-actuallzation needs, For example, mate preferences 
for kindness can explain our sodal needs for intimacy, belonging, and 
acceptance, Mate preferences for status can explain our esteem needs 
for recognition, fame, and glory, \-late preferences for intelligence, 
knowledge, skills, and moral virtues can explain our cognitive needs 
to learn, discover, and creale, and our self-actualization needs to fulfill 
our potential (for example, to display the highest possible mate value 
given our genetic quality), 
Moreover, a branch of evolutionary theory called "life history 
theory" points out that there are often tough trade -offs between 
these survival and reproductive priorities, The lower-level 
do 
not always take priority, Por example, male elephant seals will often 
starve to death during a breeding season while guarding their harems, 
If elephant seals could talk, and you recruited them to participate in 
a focus group at your market research institute, they might explain 
that they were giving up a physiological need (to eat) for three higher 
needs: a social need (to feel intimae), and belonging with each of many 
females), an aesthetic lleed (to be surrounded by beautiful~····,that is, 
line, fit, fat, fertile-females), and a self-actualization need (to be the 
best elephant seal One can be, as demonstrmed lhrough biting, maul-
ing, bloodying, and excluding all male sexual rivals from one's beach-
front harem), But these last three Maslovian needs can actually be 
reduced to reprocluctive benefits, I\:atural selection crafted social, aes-
thetic, and self-actualization motivations because they yielded higher 
reproductive success over thousands of generations of elephant seal 
evolution, Male elephant s<",ais who were "slackers," content to fulfill 
their survlVal and safety needs withoLtt coMict, would have avoided 
the bloody beach siles where more ambitious "status seekers" fought, 
copulated, starved, and died, The s1",:ker seals may haY{' hCt'n per-

feetly happy, and might have even turned vegan and ate plankton, 
they dId not leave any descendants to inherit their easygoing tempera-
ments, Only the male seals that were willing to compete for domi-
nance, status, and harems, even at the cost of their own lives, sired 
uny offspring, Although male humans did not evolve in prehistory to 
compete for large harems, both human sexes did evolve to compete 
for high-quality mates, friends, and allies, leaving us with many of the 
same drives, los tincts, preferences, and aspirations that the elephant 
seals in the focus group might have artkulated, 
Finally, Maslow's hierarchy overlooh mnst of the adaptive prefer-
('nees, emotions, motivations, and aspirations that evolutionary psychol-
Ilg)' has demonstrated in human nature, It cOMales different forms of 
love-parental solicitude toward offspring, familial solicitude toward 
kin, social attachment to same-sex friends, romantic attachment to 
Illutes, cultural attachment to one's tribe, It ignores the distinctive 
functions of gratitude, guilt, shame, embarrassment, moral outrage, 
and forgiveness in sustaining cooperation within groups, 
While Maslow's work was a useful early step in categoriZing the 
uiversity of human motivations, It never integrated Darwinjan insights, 
Ilnd it is now seriously outdated, Its continuing popularity in marketing 
~nd consumer behavior textbooks is pualing, especially since market-

IOil about consumer behavior; perhaps nothing better has yet emerged

pubHc has hecome familiar with it through excellent popular books by 
Richard Dawkins, Steven Pinker, David Buss, Matt Ridley, E, 0 Wil-
son, and others, and rhrough fascmating TV documentaries by PBS 
and the Discovery Channel in the United States, and by the BBC and 
Channel 4 in the UK 
Evolutionary principles have also revolutionized many traditional 
disciplines during the same period, Hundreds of papers and dozens 
of books have discussed Darwinian medicine, Darwinian psychiatry, 
evolutJonary analysis in law, evolutionary economics, Darwinian polit-
ical science, Darwinian aesthetics, and Darwinian moral theory, Inso-
far as evolutionary principles promote a more coherent understanding 
of human nature, their populariry should not be surprising, because 
human natnre is at the foundation of all social sciences and humani-
t!es, However, the bus mess world has conspicuously remained the odd 
man ouL Marketing, advertiSing, consumer research, and product 
development are equally dependent on an accurate understanding of 
human nature, yet evolutionary insights have so far had little influence 
in this 
Executives are still trained in MBA programs, and market research-
ers are still trained in Ph,D. programs, as if humans were created from 
day eight thousand years ago, and designed with an arbitrary list of 
"manifest motives" and "latent motives," Virtually no course content 
on the evolutionary origins of human behavior and preferences is 
included at any of the world's lOp business schools-IMD (Lausanne), 
INSEAD (Paris), ESADE (Barcelona), London Business School, Rot-
terdam School of Management, Indian Institute of Management (Ban-
galore), Queens School of Business (Toronto), Harvard, Stanford, MIT 
(Sloan), U. Penn (Wharton), New York Universiry (Stern), or North-
western (Kellogg)_ To date, only a few researchers have used Darwin-
ian insights in any systematic way to understand consumer behavior-
Since the late 1990s the marketmg professor Gad Saad, at Concor-
dia Business School in Montreal, has been developing this new {idd

of evolutionary consumer psychology almost single-handedly, He pub-
hshed the first papers about evolutionary psychology to appear in any 
marketing Or consumer behavior journals, and published the first book 
on the topic, The Evolutionary Bases at Consumption, in 2001. 
Since 
mid-1980s, the Cornell economist Robert H. Frank has 
been using evolutionary principies of sodal and sexual competition 
to understand the mOre specific issues of runaway economic status 
seeking and conspicuous consumption, His books, such as Choosing 
the Right Pond, The Wilmer-Take-AU Society, and Lwmry FeL'er, have 
not only connected Darwin and Veblen, and framed human econom ic 
behavior in its biological context, but have also pioneered new empiri-
cal ways to analyze economic data, in order to demonstrate the perva-
sive effects of status seeking in career choices and consumer choices, 
(Robert H_ Frank is not to be confused with journalist Robert L 
['rank, author of Richistcm,) lowe Gad Saad and Robert Frank a great 
debt for their ground breaking work 
More recently, a few other researchers, such as the marketing pro-
fessors VJadas Griskevidus at University of Minnesota and Jill Sundie 
at UniverSity of Houston, have been taking evolutionary consumer psy-
chology forward in new directions by integrating it more closely with 
social psychology. A few other evolmionary psychologists have thought 
"bout human nature in relation to particular kinds of products, such 
us food, pets, landscapes, Singles ads, drugs, pornography, and novels, 
In each case, by more clearly understanding the evolutionary origins, 
hiological functions, and design features of our psychological adapta-
lions (such as Our perceptions, emotions, and preferences), researchers 
<,an better understand the "hedonomics" 
pleasure-giving design 
"'''tures-of various goods and services, 
At the moment, though, Darwinians have only scratched the sur-
!;lee of consumer behavior, The most powerful theory in the whole 
or lhe biolOgical and behavioral sciences, a theory that explains the 
orilli ns and functions of the complex psychological adaptations that 
constitute human nature, has rarely been called on to illuminate the 
SwtlmpS 'Illd jllogles of modern conslImerism, where we all live these

days. For example, given the antibiological biases of most consumer, 
behavior researchers and journal editors, as of mid-200B only one 
paper mentioning evolutionary psychology has ever appeared in any 
of marketing's four leading academic journals-Joumal of Consumer 
Research,Jounud oj !vlarketing, Journal of Marketing Research. and Mar-
keting Science. None of them has ever published an article concerning 
biological evolution, human nature, Dan\~nism, Or primate behavior 
Consumer research has been almost as obhvious to the extraor-
dinary recent progress in the study of individual differences--the 
ways that people's minds are distinct from one another's. Individual-
differences research has delivered some wonderfully robust and useful 
models of human personalit)" intelligence, and moral virtue. These 
models are much 
than might have been expected. Human per-
sonality, for example, can be represented quite accurately by just the 
"Big Five" dimensions of variation between people: openness to expe-
rience, conscientiousness, 
agreeableness, and emotional 
stability. Human intelligence can be represented with astonishing effi-
ciency and accuracy by just one dimension, called the g factor (a.ka. 
general intelligence, general cognitive ability, IQ). As we'll see later, if 
we know how an individual scares On these "Central Six" dimensions 
(the Rig Five personality trailS plus general intelligence), we can pre-
dict a great deal about his habits, prefetences, values, and attitudes-
and about the products he may acquire to display those traits to others. 
Al! six dimensions are also genetically heritable: twin and adoption

evolved over the past few million years, It argued that some of our 
most wondrous and distinctive human mental abilities-art, music, 
language, kindness, intelligence, and creativity-evolved not just for 
survival, but for reproduction, Specifically, they evolved in both sexes 
as fitness indicators to attract high-quality sexual partners, 
To explain how the process of sexual selection through mate choice 
might have shaped human mental evolution, The Mating I'vliml used 
a lot of marketing metapllOrs, Animals seek sexual partners in a com-
petitive mating markeL Animal bodies and behaviors evolve largely as 
advertisements for their genes, ,vlale humans evolved potent new sales 
tactics-verbal courtship, rhythmic music, gentle foreplay, prolonged 
copulation-for sedUCing skeptical female customers into accepting 
free trials of their fastest-moving consumer goods (sperm), Female 
humans evolved potent new tactics of relationship marketing to build 
long-term loyalty among their highest-value male customers, and to 
promote continued "[nale investment in their new subsidiaries (chil-
dren), Human creativity evolved to keep our mates fascinated as we 
release ever-new beha\·ioral products-new utterances, stories, jokes, 
observations, ideas, artifacts, songs, and gifts-designed to seem ini-
tially fashionable but that quickly become obsolete. Each individual's 
ideology (religiOUS, political, and philosophical beliefs) can even be 
viewed not as his editorial content but as his ad campaign-designed 
not to convey verifiable news about the worM, but to create positive 
emotional associations between the individual as product and the cus-
tomer's aesthetic, social, and moral aspirations. 
These marketing metaphors seem to work as well as they do 
because most readers knuw more about shopping than about sexual 
selection theory, so the latter could be explained by reference to the 
former Spent tries to reverse the direction of explanation, by analyz-
ing consumer behavior based on \-vhat we know about human evolution 
and individual differences, This task might prove harder, given that it

simply visualize the molecular stmcture of ethanol, and imagine the 
oxygen atom is the dog's cranium, and the two carbon atoms form the 
dog's torso, . ," Nonetheless, it's worth a try, because we really need 
to understand how consumerist capitalism arose from human nature, 
and how it could be improved, 
To follow my reasoning, you'll need to rethink most of what you 
thought you knew about your motives, preferences, and "aspirations. 
You'll have to look at your adult human life the way a wise child or a 
Cro-Magnon matriarch wuuld, You'll have to set aside some traditional 
distinctions between biology and culture) animals and consumers, 
evolution and economics, psychology and marketing, You'll need some 
existential courage to accept that years of obsessive workaholism and 
status-seeking conswnption may have been misguided, 
That's the hard part The easy part is that Spent demands very little 
background expertise, You don't need to know much about psychology, 
beyond what you already know about people, You don't need to know 
much about consumerist capitalism, beyond what you already know 
about shopping, In fact, the less you've been taught about traditional 
marketing and economics, the fewer misconceptions you'll have to 
overcome.

I hal scientists work to maintain the status quo, and that evolutionary 
psychologists like me are especially dangerous and conservative, Even 
many marketers have been socialized to take that ,~ew. As you will see,

economically important but less interesting, such as commodities and

ties (water, gas, electricity, heating, cooling, lighting), basic consumer 
durables (appliances, furniture, linens), and financial products (bank-

many of these categories, consumerist shOwing off and status display 
are less important, as when one is seeking the best price on soybean oil 
futures, or the best heart surgeon, or tite most reliable life insurance 
company. No doubt the evolutionary psvchology of consumer behavior 
will eventually embrace all 
product categories, but I won't here.

and a childhood in Cincinnati, OhIO, That year, some key founders of 
evolutionary psychology-Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, David Buss, 
Martin Daly, and Margo Wilson-were all visiting Stanford for a sab, 
batieal year, My friend Peter Todd and I got excited about their ideas, 
met ''''ith them about once a week, and learned about the extraordinary 
potential of Darwinian theory to revolutionize psychology, Everything 
about human behavior suddenly seemed easier to understand-dearer, 
simpler, more functional, more grounded in the 3-billion-year saga of 
life On earth, Everything in psychology seemed more W1ifled-more 
connected not only to the other 
but also to the humanities 
and to everyday life, I got hooked on the idea that human hehavior 
could be best understood by considering the chaJlenges of survival and 
reproduction that our prehIstoric ancestors faced, Th.is paradigm shift 
seemed uniquely satisfying and complete-as if I had found my intel-
lectual home onCe and for aU, and nothing could ever blow my mind in 
the same way again, 
FOrlunately, I was wrong About ten years later, I got a research 
job at the new Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution at 
University College London, My challenge was to get the evolutionary 
psycholOgists and game-theory economists to work together. I spent 
months talking to researchers individually, in groups, and at confer-
ences, It was the most frustrating experience of my professional life, 
for we psychologists just did not understand the economists, and they 
did not understand us, We were interested in 
people; they were 
interested in idealized markets, We liked experiments; they liked prov-
ing mathematical theorems. We published ideas about human nature; 
they published results about Paroto-<iominant equilibrium selection in 
mixed-motive games (don't ask), 
My crisis point came at a 1999 conference that I organized in lon-
don on the origins of people's economic preferences. We psychologists 
thought that economist~ would enjoy hearing about our preference 
experiments, so that they could develop more accurate and sophisti-
cated models of human economic behavior, How wrong we were, It 
became clear that economists still followed a "revealed preferenccs" 
The Genius of Marketing 
35 
doctrine, which holds that consumer preferences are psychological 
abstractions-hidden, hypothetical states that cannot be measured 
or explained apart from the purchases that they causc, If preferences 
are revealed only through purchases, and not through questionnaires, 
interviews, or focus groups, then it is redundant to study preferences 
from actual consumer spending patterns, to speculate about the 
origins of preferences, or to conduct market research on preferences 
for hypothetical products, In short, the revealed preferences doctrine 
suggests that psychology is irrelevant to economics, (Ibis was before 
the psychologist Daniel Kahneman got the 2002 Nobel Prize in 
nomics for his work on decisions and preferences,) So, the economists 
gradually drifted away from the conference, leaving the psychologists 
to nurse our bmised egos, in the company of some strange-looking 
folks we hach!t seen before, 
These folks weren't like the academics at the conference, They 
were forty-five but looked twenty-five; they had funky clothes and hair; 
they spoke with torrential enthusiasm; they gave out business cards 
with baffling job titles (Cool-HW1ter, Frenzy-Mistress, Vice-President 
of Buzz, Meme-Seeder), They were the marketers, and they were hot 
for psychology, They actually cared about people's preferences-where 
they come from, how they worked. and how to profit from them, I 
talked for hours with them, and a new world opened up, 
Over the next several years, 1 read everything I could about mar-
keting, advertising, public relations, market research, product deSign, 
retailing, hranding, positioning, and conSUmer behavior. It felt as if my 
latent interest-in-business genes had finally turned on, (My maternal 
grandfather, Henry G, Baker, had been a professor of management 
and marketing at the University of Cincinnati, and most of his five 
sons now run private equity funds,) I taught COurses on the evolution-
ary psychology of consumer behavior, first to undergraduates at UCLA 
in 2000 as a visiting professor, then at UNM to graduate studenls, I 
became fascinated by inelsive portrayals of the consumerist hfestyle in 
movies such as The Matrix, Existenz, American Beauty, and Idiocracy, 
and in novds by Chuck I'uhlhniuk, Douglas Coupland, Nicholson

Baker, and 1- G. Ballard. I talked about marketing with everybody I 
knew who was involved in it-old high school frjends, relatives, neigh-
bors, local business school faculty. I subscribed at various times over 
the past seven years to any periodical that seemed likely to reveal 
something new about consumerism: Architectural Digest, AutoHieek, 
the Baffler, the Chronicle of Higher Education, Consumer Reports, 
the Ecal1om;st, Gourmet, Harper's, Maxim, Men's Fitness, Money, PC 
Gamer, Premiere, Rolling Stone, Stuff, Wired, Worth, the Utne Reader, 
and Vanity Fair. I also pulled articles and ads from the occasional issue 
of Action Pursuit Games, Adult Video News, All Ahout Beer, Atomic 
Ranch, Christian Music Planet, Cosmetic Surgery Times, Frozen Food 
Age, Guns &- Ammo, Hooked on Crochet! Hot Boat, Log flome Living, 
Lu:xury SpaFinder, Meat Processing, Modern Bride, Modern Dog, lvfon-
ster JVluscle, New Age Retailer, Packaging Digest, Pet Product News, 
Spcn Compact Car, and Tropical Fish Hobbyist. This was not always as 
fun as it sounds. I also read a few hundred books on consumerism and 
business, in search of good ideas. 
1 started to see that marketing underlies everything in modern 
human culture in the same way that evolution underlies everything in 
human nature. Writers have agents; movies have publicists; politicians 
have press secretaries. Magazines are published not to inform readers, 
but to sell the market segment-the readers' attenLion-to advertisers. 
Almost nothing in popular culture gets there by chance or gossip, by 
the unsupervised spread of memes from one mind to another. Every-
thing has been put on the public's radar screen deliberately by market-
ing professionals of one sort or another. 
1 realized, in short, that if you weren't tuned in to marketing, you 
were missing the elephant in culture's living room.

Why Marketing Is Central to Culture 
MARKETING IS NOT just one of the most important ideas in busi-
ness. It has become the most dominant force in human culture. If 
this sounds like an outrageously strong claim that no rational person 
could believe, consider that much of this disbelief stems from mis-
understanding "marketing" as a pretentious term for advertising. But 
marketing is far more than that. It is, ideally, a systematic attempt to 
fulfill human desires by prodUCing goods and services that people will 
buy. It is where the wild frontiers of human nature meet the wild pow-
ers of technology. Like chivalrous lovers, the best marketing-oriented 
companies help us discover desires we never knew we had, and ways 
of fulfilling them we never imagined. 
Almost everything we can buy has been shaped by some mar-
keting people in some company thinking hard about how to sell us 
things that we think will make us happier. Adam Smith's "invisible 
hand" has spawned the invisible eye. Production is no longer guided 
by the clumsy feedback provided by last quarter's profit figures, but 
by empirical research into human preferences and personalities, focus 
waul's, questionnaires, beta testing, social surveys, and demographics. 
Psychology has given way to market research as the most important 
investigator of human nature. For example, as of 2004, about 212,000 
Americans worked as market and survey researchers, whereas only 
ni>oul 37,000 worked as psychology professors. 
Markets themselves are ancient, but the concept of marketing in 
ils modern form arose only in the twentieth century. In agricultural 
and mercantile societies there were producers, guilds, traders, bank-
('rs. and retailers. but economic consciousness was focused on mak-
i11).\ 1l101lCY, Ilot 011 rc'sc;trching anu fulfilling consumer desires in any

systematic way, Only through trial and error did A Ibrecht Durer learn 
what kinds of prints would seli, or Thomas Chippendale learn which 
of his chairs would prove fashionable. With the Industrial Revolution, 
mass production led to a greater emphasis on the cost efficiency of 
production rather than the satisfaction of the customer. As markets 
matured in the early twentieth centurY, businesses bad to compete 
harder for market share, but they did so througb advertising and 
promotions aimed at un loading their goods on resistant customers. 
Only gradually did corporations understand the relevance of psy-
chology to sales. A key figure was Edward Bernays (1891-1995), a 
founding theorist of propaganda, public relations, and advertising. Bet-
nars was Sigmund Freud's nephew, and used psychoanalytic insights 
to address what he called the problem of "engineering consent" in a 
democratic 
He consulted 00 ad campaigns for Dodge, Proeter 
a nd Gamble, General Electric, and Cartier, and helped the United 
Fruit Company (now known as Chiquita) overthrow the Guatemalan 
government in J954, In his 1928 hookPropaganaa, Bemays argued 
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized hab-
its and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic 
SOciety. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society 
constitute an invisible govemment which is the true ruling power of 
our country. 
Yet, even Bernays realized that effective manipulation of pubhc opin-
ion required listening to the beliefs and desires of consumerS and citi-
zenS. Governments and corporations need to listen in confessionals, 
not jost to shout from tbe pulpit. Good public relations require good 
pul>lic opinion pails, not just good propaganda, 
By the time Willie Loman was lamenting the fall of traditional 
hucksterism in Death of a Salesman in 1949, several consumer-goods 
companies had developed a more respectfu I, inquisitive attitude toward 
the consumer. The marketing revolution they launched came with 
the same sense of wand rous inevitahility that accompanies all scien-

39 
tific revolutions. That a company should produce what people desire, 
instead of trying to convince people to buy what 
company hap-
pens to make, was a radical idca that seems obvious only in retrospect. 
The.~e corporations established marketing departments dedicated to 
finding out what people want from their detergents, soaps, and light-
bulbs. Their success spawned imitators, and almost all large corpora-
tions now include marketing arms tbat are supposed to coordinate all 
aspects of product research 
development, advertiSing, promotion, 
and distribution. 
By the 1960s, as more and more marketing executives were pro-
moted to CEO positions, some firms adopted the modem "marketing 
orientation," in which everything the firm does is aimed at making 
profits by satisfying consumers, This constituted an invisible revolu-
tion in the 1960s, and though it did not get the same press as the sexual 
revolution, the hippies, or the New Left, unlike these counterculture 
trends, the marketing revolution radically changed the way business 
works, (Indeed, the marketing revolution was largely responsible for 
the popular spread of countercultural values through cool new prod-
ucts like the Volkswagen T2a Bus, the Enovid contraceptive piU, and 
Jimi Hendrix records, 
of which were often combined enjoyably,) 
While the marketing orientation has become commonplace in com-
panies that produce things for individual customers, such as dothes, 
cars) 
and movies, it remains rare in the hCilV}' inciust(ies 
(steel, coal, oil, and paper), where the immediate consumers are other 
husinesses, and where conspicuous consumption and luxury brand-
ing are less important. The marketing orientation is also still poorly 
developed in most service industries such as banking, law, govern-
ment, the police, the military, medicine, charity, and science. in(ieed, 
Illost leaders in these sectors do not think of themselves as working in 
,,'rvice industnes. But until they do, they will not bother using market 
It'search to shape their services to their customers' desires, and their 
institutions will lose market share to those that do,

but least understood revolutions in human history, marking a decisive 
power shift from institutions to individuals. Production made work-
ers into technology's servants; marketmg, ideally, makes consumers 
into technology's masters. Marketing zealots might even take the view 
that the marketing revolution renders most of Marx irrelevant: 'vVhat 
meaning could "alienation" and "exploitation" have when businesses 
work so hard to fulfill our desires as consumers) 
Generally speaking, intellectual, still don't understand marketing. 
It is largely invisible to right-Wing economists, who think 
carry 
all the information about supply and demand that markets need in 
order to produce the goods and services that people want. There was 
no role for market research in the worldviews of the economists Adam 
Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, or Gary Becker. To left-
wing social scientists, journalists, and Hollywood scriptwriters, in con-
trast, marketing means nothing more than manipulative advertiSing by 
greed)' corporations. Since they rarely deign to talk to businesspeople, 
they believe that modern business works like the evil Omni Consumer 
Products corporation from Robocop, The rare professors who acquire 
some modest oet worth tend to learn much more about investments 
tban about marketing, because while investment advice is ever},where 
(CNBC, Fox Business Network, personal finance magazines), market-
ing knowledge lurks as a sort of arcane magic behind this financial-
product hucksterism, 
One problem is that marketers, like all profeSSionals and academ-
ics, are prone to showing off their expertise by using distinctive terms 
and concepts that are baffling to eavesdroppers. \lJhen disempowered 
subcultures use private jargon, they sOlmd cute. But when market-
ers with heavy economic firepower do so, they can sound both hilari-
ous and necromantic, like Pentagon acronyms, Consider these lines

Such canny observations no doubt mean something, but it's not dear 
what. 
Even within business, although most younger managers understand 
marketing at a practical level, they do not know how to talk about it as 
" cultural, economic, social, and psychological revolution, as it is not 
presented that way to them in business school. Business journalists, 
likewise, 
not brought the marketing revolution into public dis-
course the way they have brought

Like fish unaware of water, we do not realize that we live in the 
A!I,c of Marketing It does not much matter whether products are mate-
rial or cultural, sold in stores or online, What matters is tbat products 
11£0 systematically conceived, deSigned, tested, produced, and distrib-
tiled based on the preferen<:es of consumers rather thao 00 the con-
venience of producers. The New Economy, "Web 2.0;' and "social 
network marketing" are just the most recenl stages in the marketing 
l'{'Volution. 
How can we understand this revolution' There are two analogies 
from history that can help us think about it. Democracy can be seen 
ilS the marketing concept applied to government. The American and 
I,'r('ncb revolutions brought the marketing concept to politics long 
!".J'orc it gained a toehold in business. The production-oriented state

whllt it can do for voters. Citizens demanded the vote so they could

S PEN T 
rocus groups were telling manufacturers what goods they wanted. "No 
taxation without representation" came long before "No profits without 
market research." 
Even before these political revolutions, the Protestant Reformation 
applied the marketing insight to religion. Martin Luther and John 
vin organized churches to fill the emotional needs of worshipers, not 
the fiscal interests of priests. They were dissatisfied with a production-
oriented papacy that churned out costly rituals in a dead language 
within opulent cathedrals. They crafted a now form of Christianity 
based on local languages, simple churche..s, and glorious music. The 
thirty thousand current denominations of the Christian faith are 
just what we would expect from efficient market segmentation given 
diverse consumers of religious services. Similar shifts occurred from 
production-oriented Hinayana Buddhism to market-oriel1ted Mahay-
ana Buddhism, and from Orthodox to Reform Judaism. The common 
denominator in busmess marketing, political democracy, and reli-
gious reform is the transfer of power from service providers to service 
consumers. 
Is the marketing revolution a good thing? On the upside, it promises 
a golden age in which social institutions and markets are systematically 
organized on the basis of strong empirical research to maximize human 
happiness. \Vhat science did for perception, marketing promises to 
do for production; it tests intuition and insight against empirical fact. 
Market research uses mostly the same empirical tools as experimen-
tal psychology, but with larger research budgets, better-defined ques-
tions, more representative samples of people, and mOre social impact. 
Ideally, marketing's empiriclsm works like Rogerian psychotherapy, in 
which the therapist restates and reflects the patient's concerns, Mar-
keting holds up a mirror to our selves, reflecting otlr beliefs and desires 
so we can recogo ize, remember, evaluate, and transform them. The 
invention of real mirrors empowered people to accept or reject poten-
tial modifications to thei.r appearance with greater accuracy and objec-
tivity, allowing them to try different makeup, hairstyles, and fashions, 
to judge what looks good. The marketing revolution cmpowt'rs us in 
Why Marketing Is Centrol to Culture 
43 
a Similar way, on a longer timescale. It allows us to accept or reject 
potential ways of displaying our traits through our product choices. 
We can try on different lifestyles, experience the results, and perhaps 
even change our consumer preferences if we're dissatisfied. 
On the downside, marketing is the Buddha's worst nightmare. It 
is the grand illusion, the Veil of Maya, turned pseudoscientific and 
backed by billion-dollar advertising campaigns. It perpetuates the 
delusion that desire leads to fulfillment. It is the enemy of mindful 
human consciousness, because conscjousness is content with its own 
company, and needs Jittle from the world. 
The trouble is not that marketing promotes materialism. Quite the 
opposite, It promotes a narcissistic pseudospiritualism based on sub· 
j,'c!ive pleasure, social status, romance, and lifestyle, as a product's 
mental associations become more important than its actual physical 
'Iualities. This is the whole point of advertising and branding-to 
l'rcate associations between a product and the aspirations of the con-
,umer, so the product seems to be worth more to the consumer than 
lis mere physical form could possibly warrant. Marketing actually 
nvoids materialism at all costs, for if consumers comparison shopped 
Holcly on the basis of objective material features and costs, the prod-
ru:ts themselves would be reduced to commodities-and commodities 
~ilnnot be sold for serious profits in a competitive market. 
For example, tap water (about $0.006 per gallon in Albuquerque) 
I. a low-profit commodity, whereas Glaceau SmartWater ($1.39 per 
thirty-Four-ounce bottle, or $5.20 per gallon) is a high-profit branded 
pmtluct. SmartWaler sounds like a magical intelligence-boosting elixir 
rrom the French Alps, so it can be sold for 870 times the price per 
volume of conunodity water, even though it is really just distilled water

Thus, a world run by marketing to profit from consumer desires 
will never allow itself to be "commodified" into a "materialistic" world. 
Rather, it could easily transmute into a virtual reality where neither 
products nor consumers require any physical qualities at all Mar-
keting's logical culmination would not be crass materialism, but the 
seductive immateralism of The Matrix or Sec01ui Life. 
Marketing also creates some more immediate problems. Like 
democracy, it fort:es intellectual and cultural elites 10 confront their 
patronizing attitudes toward the masses. Elites do not always like com-
panies 
states that provide what the people desire. Consumers may 
want sweets, fats; and sugars; cigarettes/ beer. and marijuana; motor-
cycles and handguns; porn videos and prostitutes; breast implants and 
Viagra; reality TV and formulaic anime. Uk""l1se, if everybody voted, 
they might want the death penalty, prayer in schools, book burning, 
ethnic cleanSing, fascism, and Amerimn !dol. PlaIa clearly saw the 
difference between a mass demoe racy based on universal suffrage, 
and a republic based on the utopian visions of elites. For the elite, 
marketing's populism can be an alarming prospect. Plato thus rejected 
the marketing orientation-including democracy, which is marketing 
applied to politics-as a basis for social organization. His ideal benev-
olent dictator, the philosopher-king, does not organize focus groups, 
conduct market surveys, or hold elections to decidc his policies. The 
common folk cannot be trusted to understand their true long-term 
interests, for the mismatch between theIr primitive instincts and the 
behavioral demands of civilized life are so severe that the enlightened 
minority must control the ignorant majority, for the greater good. Con-
fucius had similar views: the patriarch must rule the family, just as 
the emperor must rule the nation, to impose civilized order on natural 
anarchy. 
This Platonic-Confucian tradition dominated European and Asian 
political theory for millennia. It can still be seen today, whenever elites 
argue that the state should collect taxes and pw,·ide certain services 
that people can't Or won't buy as individuals. Sometimes these slate-
organi7.ed services seem sensible (roads, (i", o('panml1lls, health eare, 
Why Marketing Is Centrol to Culture 
45 
the BBC)' sometimes not (farming subsidies, fraudulent wars, hridges 
to nowhere). The Platonic-Confucian ideal also comes into play when-
ever elites argue that some product or behavior must be banned. 
(Sometimes the elites bave a point; even among Second Amendment 
extremists, few would advocate that your local Target store sbould be 
allowed to sell FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missiles.) 
Marketing, like democracy, bas the (often untapped) potential to 
be anti-arrogance, anti-powet, and anti-idealism. It can, in principle, 
replace elitist progressive visions based on the illusion of popular 
consent with the reality of a world shaped to fulfill ordinary human 
desires. It is tempting to minimiz.e the marketing revolution, to naIvely 
propose that the most significant revolutions of the past mi!!ennia have 
been technological inventions that expand production capabilities, or 
scientific ideas that inform elite ideals. If we do choose to ignore the 
marketing revolution, we do so because we are terrified of a world in 
which our elite ideals lose their power to control the fruits of technol-
ogy. (If you have the leisure lime, education, and indination to read 
this book. vou are obviously a member of the elite.) Marketing threat-
ens to put 'infinite production ability in the sef\~ce of infinite human 
lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, greed, envy, and pride. It portends a world 
of rdwcrac)" Cinnabons, and Super Bowls. It threatens to atomize 
human society into 6 billion navel-gaz.ing blog writers. 
Or is the elite's 
of that prospect just another self-deceptive 
rationale for keeping a stranglehold on power) Fear of an economy 
based on market research, like 
fear of democracy based on uni-
versal suffrage, is based on contempt for fellow members of our spectes. 
Elites hate to recognize the marketing revolution because they hate to 
acknowledge that contempt. Marketing is the most important inven-
tion of the past two millennia because it is the only revolution that has 
ever succeeded in bringing real economic power to the people. It is not 
just the power to redistribute wealth, to split the social cake into dif-
ferent pieces. Rather, it is the power to make our meanS of production 
Iransform the oalur,,1 world into a playground for human passions.

our planet's "net primary productivity"-more than half the biomass 
grown each year on earth. One lucky species, oul of 20 million, sucks 
up half of the biosphere's annual output, and transforms it into work 
roles and leisure activities that are structured mainly by marketing. 
Marketing does not just dominate human culture; since human cul-
ture dominates the matter and energy flows that constitute terrestrial 
life, It also, at this historical moment, dominates life on earth. 
Marketing Versus Memes 
This blindness to marketing's cultural role 
especially clear 
when I joined a debate about memes, moderated by Richard Dawkins, 
at Oxford University in May 1999. My debating parmer, the British 
psychologist Susan Blackmore, had just published her book Tlw Meme 
Machine. She argued, following Dawkins, that much of human culture 
reflects an evolutionary competition between memes: jnformation 
units such as stories, anecdotes, ideas, catchphrases, or jingles that 
can be remembered and repeated to others, Memes that are salient, 
memorable, and communicable (like celebrity gossip and human 
interest stories) are expected to proliferate and spread. Memes that 
are irrelevant and forgettable (like the fact that a proton has about 
1,836 times the mass of an electron) should fade quickly from popu lar 
consciousness (despite the best efforts of high school physics teach-
ers). According to Blackmore, human popular culture consists of suc~ 
cessful memes that reflect the interests and preferences of individual 
humans. 
The meme idea has always seemed fasCinating 
provocative, 
especially in Blackmore's book. However, I 
a somewhat differ-
ent line: most successful memes are imposed top down by marketing, 
in the mterests of certain powerful individuals, groups, and institu-
tions. It seemed clear that the most successful memes-religions, 
political ideologies, languages, cultural norms, technologies-have been 
disseminated by churches, states, school systems, and corporations 
with immense wealth and power. In princil)lc, 111,]fkClinf; responds

to pre-existing consumer preferences. In fact, marketers sometimes 
refer to their work as "cultural engineering" 
intentional creation 
and dissemination of new culture units (memes) through advertising, 
branding, and public relations. 
Even the proliferation of ordinary memes (such as buzz about films, 
new social and political issues, countries to fear this yearl is dominated 
by the six global media conglomerates: 
• TimeWarner ($45 billion in revenue, 87,000 employees as 
of 2006), including Warner Brns., New Line Cinema, AOL, 
CompuServe, Atlantic Records, HBO, CNN, Time Warner 
Cable, Turner Broadcasting, Time-Life Books, and the 
magazines Time, Life, Money, and People 
• Disney ($34 billion in revenue, 133,000 employees), including 
Touchstone, Miramax, Buena Vista, ABC TV, ESPN TV, 
Hyperion Books, Discover magazine, and ABC Radio 
Networks 
• NewsCorp 
billion in revenue, 47,000 employees), 
including Twentieth Century Fox, Fox TV, Sky satellite 
TV, Sky Radio, HarperCollins Books, TV Guide, and 175 
newspapers 
• Vivendi Universal (S20 binion in revenue, 34,000 employees), 
including Universal Studios, Geffen Records, Polygram, 
Universal Music Group, Canal+ TV, and Universal Television 
Group 
• Bertelsmarm ($20 billion in revenue, 97,000 employees), 
including UFA Film and TV, Barnes and Noble, BMG Music 
Publisbing, RCA Records, AOL Europe, and the publishers 
Ballantine, Bantam, Crown, Doubleday, Dell, Fodors, Knopf, 
and Random House 
• Viacom ($10 billion in revenue, 9,500 employees), including 
Paramount, United Cinemas, CBS TV, MTV, Sbowtime 
TV, Simon & Schuster, Infinity Radio, and Viacom Outdoor 
advertising 

48 
S? E N T 
These conglomerates relentlessly cross-promote their TV charmels, 
films, magazines, and books through all available media, For example, 
if Warner Bros, releases a big-budget film such as The Dark Knight, it 
will typically be featured on the covers of Time and People magazines, 
reviewed favorably on CNN, and well advertised On AOL This is not 
conspiracy theory; 
just good business sense and standard operating 
procedure for media conglomerates. 
Apart &om these big six media conglomerates, there are the four 
big advertising holding companies: 
• Omnicon ($13 billion, 61,000 employees) 
• WPP ($12 billion in revenue, 100,000 employees in 106 
countries as of 2007) 
• Interpublic ($7 billion, 43,000 employees) 
• Publicis ($6 billion, 44,000 employees) 
academics have never heard of these companies, but tlley are at 
tbe heart of cultural engineering, as they are involved not only in adver-
tising, but also deSign, marketing, media buying, public relations, and 
lobbying The)' design the memes, buy the airtime and column inches 
to distribute them, and measure how well tbe memes are achieving 
their purposes in promoting consumer, investor, and political recogni-
lion for their clients. Altogether, about $400 billion per year is spent 
in the global ad market-money spent specifically to promote some 
memes, brands, products, and people at the expense of others, 
Consider another example of cultural engineering: food prefer-
ences, Every evoluhonary psychology textbook suggests that our fast-
food cravings [or fat, salt, and sugar are innate, evolved preferences, 
The theory is that because these nutrients were so rare and valuable in 
prehistory, we inherited an insatiable desire forth em that is now coun-
terproductive' making us fat and sick Honey was hard to get in the 
Pleistocene, so now we can't help bUl eatlwo·hundred-calorie Krispy 
Kreme doughnuts, Th" evolutionary view nicely accounts for some 
cross-cultural univcrsal~ in food preferences, 
'Why Morkeling I, Cenlrollo Culture 
49 
l'vleme theory offers a different view: maybe we consume steaks, 
doughnuts, and sodas because we've seen others do so, and have imi-
tated their eating habits. We could just as well have ended up favoring 
pickled tofu and Siberian kale, but the random dymunics of meme 
evolution took us in a different direction, Thls meme view might 
wise explain some cross-cultural differences in food preferences, such 
as why Americans tend to turn 
naturally savory foods into sweet 
desserts, by such measures as adding barbecue sauce to meat, ketchup 
to french fties, honey-mustard dressing to salad, sugar to bread, and 
corn SyTUp to water ("soda"). 
\>Vbile their insights are valuable, it would be helpful for both evo-
lutionary psychologists and meme theorists also to recognize the eco-
nomic, political, and marketing power of the global food industry, In 
the United States, we 
alot offat, salt, and sugar ;n processed foods 
partly because there are rich, powerful trade organizations that lobby 
politicians very effectively for government subsidies and contracts, 
weaker regulations, and tort reform to minimize liability, including 
t he National Council of Chain Restaurants, }\:ational Grocers Asso-
ciation, Food Products Association, Food Marketing Institute, and 
Grocery Manufacturers of America, The National Restaurant Asso-
dation represents the nine hundred thousand US restaurants, which 
<'mploy 12.2 million workers and earn $476 billion in revenue per year. 
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association represents eight hundred 
(housand ranchers who "harvest" about 26 
pounds of 
per 
year from 35 miUion cattle, The National Chicken Council repre-
s<'nts massive companies such as Tyson, Gold Kist, Pilgrim's Pride, 
and ConAgra, which sell about 600 million pounds of chicken flesh 
PC[ week in the United States, by killing about 8 billion chickens per 
year. Further promoting fat and protein consumption are tile Am"ri-
('(In Meat Institute, National Pork Board, National TUrkey Federation, 
International Dairy Foods Association, and National Milk Producers 
Ihleration. To promote salt consumption, we have the Snack Food

for Dressings and Sauces, and International Jelly and Preserves Asso-
ciation, The Com Refiners Association is especially important, since 
it represents the U.S, "com wet-milling industry," which manufactures 
about 25 billion pounds of high-fructose corn syrup per year. Com 
syrup is the main ingredient in sodas (apart from water), and each 
American consumes on average about forty-five grams of 1t per day, 
So, we doubtlessly have some innate liking for fat, salt, and sugar. 
The lobbyists and trade organizations do not create the demand for 
these tastes out of thin air-otherwise the Pickled Tofu Marketing 
Institute and U,S, Kale Association would have greater funding, influ-
ence, and success, Nonetheless, thesc more-powerful industry groups 
hugely amplify our evolved food preferences through massive political 
clout and marketing budgets for their food groups. 
The shaping of such ideas, tastes, norms, habits, and memes by 
social power systems is exactly what the social sciences study, It is the 
very lifeblood of political sdence, sociology, and media studies, These 
sciences have realized through decades of research that they can't 
jump straight from individual psychology to mass culture through a 
simple model of meme evolution; that would be as naive as market 
fanatics thinking that political anarchy plus the economics of sup-
ply and demand would yield utopia. We also have to consider social 
institutions and interests, Meme perpetration-conscious, deliber-
ate, institutionalized strategies for shaping popular views and prefer-
ences-is what millions of people are paid to do every day when they 
work as marketers, advertisers, retailers, Or public relations experts, 
The market fanatics are right in one respect: marketing's power is 
quite decentralized. There 's no unified conspiracy, no secret Masonic 
Temple, to perpetuate capitalism, consumerism, patriarchy, hetew-
sexism, racism, or general mass stupidity and apathy_ The World Trade 
Organization is just 630 folks working in a five-story office building 
at 154 Rue de Lausanne in Geneva, Mostly, marketers are not ny.

cally floundering around like everybody else, They try to keep up with 
the latest consumer psychology rads by reading the shortest available 
pop-business books by eccentric writers with extremely large or small 
quantities of hair, 
So, none of the extreme views offered by modem science works 
very well to understand marketing, The innate-preferences theory and 
meme theory neglect marketing power entirely; the social sdence con· 
spiraey theories neglect the decentralized, dog-eat-dog, ill-educated 
competition among marketers. As a result, most behavioral sciences-
psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, political science-have 
rarely taken marketing seriously, with the result that they have largely 
ignored the mainspring of modem culture, the central force that ampli-
fies. dampens, distorts, frustrates, or fulfills human nature.

\VHlLE MARKETING is central to modern culture, the consumerist 
mind-set is central to marketing. To understand this mind·set objec-
tively, we have to reach escape velOCity from its gravity well, so that 
we ean turn around and examine it from a distance. This is hard to 
do when one's ego and self-esteem are wrapped up in one's identity as 
a consu.mer, 10 detach from consumerism, it may help to feel embar-
rassed, alienated, and betrayed by it. Like a cirrhotic drunk at his first 
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, we may find that it helps to admi.! 
that our life choices have had a whiff of insanity about them. 
Given that perspective, what sort of mental illness is most anal-
ogous to consumerism? Is it, for example, most like depression, or 
schizophrenia, or post· traumatic stress disorder) I think the relevant 
comparison here is to narcissism, technically called narcissistic per· 
sonality disorder. Personality disorders in general are deeply ingrained, 
lifelong, pervasive, maladaptive problems in living and relating to oth-
ers. Narcissism in particular is a pervasive pattern of self-centered, 
egotistical behavior that llsually begins by early adulthood, and that 
combines an intense need for admiration by otbers with a lack of 
empathy for others. 
Narcissism and Consumerism 
Freud introduced the concept of narcissism in 1914, drawing on the 
ancient Greek myth of Narcissus-a handsome, seductive young man 
who rejected the love of the wood nymph Echo, and fell io love instead 
with his 0"'11 refleetion in a pool of water, eventually withering away 
and turning into the flower that bears his name. Narcissism is thus 
This Is Your Brain on Money 
53 
love of one's external image as it would be loved by another-combined 
with contempt for others who actually feel love for one's inner quali· 
I ies. The best archetype for consumer narcissism is probably Paris Hil-
ion's self-branded fragrance, Just Me (that is, Not You and Not We), 
It's the scent of solipsism. 
The key diagnostic features of narcissism (according to psychiatry's 
hible, the cumbersomely named Diagnostic and Statistical A'Ian""l of 
Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision) are: 
• selfishness (taking advantage of others, lacking empathy) 
• arrogance (haughty, contemptuous attitudes, plus rage when 
frustrated or contradicted) 
• exceptionaHsm (belief that one is special and can only be 
appreciated by other high-status people) 
• sense of entitlement (expecting special treatment and 
automatic compliance with one's wishes) 
• admiration seeking (needing excessive attention, affirmation, 
praise, and deference) 
• success fantasizing (obsessive ambitions about unlimited 
success, power, brilliance, beauty, sexual power. or ideal love) 
• grandiosity (exaggerati.ng one's talents, achie\'ements, and 
status) 
• victim mentality (blaming the outside world for one's failures 
and disappointments) 
• anhedonia (inability to enjoy simple pleasures) 
• emotional instability (when cut off from the "narcissistic 
supply" of adulation from olhers, narcissists feel sad, hopeless, 
and even suicidal) 
'I'iI('se core symptoms lead narcissists to view themsekes as stars in 
Ilwir own life stories, protagonists in their own epics, with everyone 
"I", n minor character. (They're like bloggers that way) They talk about

They feel irritable and show a low frustration tolerance. They some-
times reward themselves with impulsive, hedonistic extremes: alcohol, 
drugs, gambling, binge eating, shopping on credit, promiscuous sex. 
They sometimes perceive a "grandiosity gap" between their inflated 
self-esteem and their actual accomplishments, leading to an unstable 
sense of self-worth and periodic self-doubts and depression. Narcis-
sists tend to seek pleasure not through informal social interaction 
with equal-status others, but through self-stimulation (fiction reading, 
TV watching, drug taking, masturbating) and showing off (ritualized 
displays to lower-status admirers, as in wearing absurdly impractical 
fashions, or throwing extravagantly destructive parties). Tech-savvy 
narcissists are also likely to do a lot of "ego surfing" (go ogling their own 
names to see what comes up), and "blog streaking" (revealing overly 
personal detaLls in their blogs). 
Does that description call to mind anyone you know? If you're 
a mature adult, it may sound like all young adults. If you're from a 
poor country, it may sound like all Americans. If you're a woman, it 
may sound like all men. Most of us can seem narcissistic to some of 
the people some of the time. However, true narcissistic personality 
disorder--extreme, relentless, hard-core narcissism-is estimated 
to affect only about 1 percent of the popu lation. Yet the capacity for 
narcissism, under certain conditions, seems present in most ordinary 
humans. Runaway consumerism works largely through creating these 
conditions and tapping this capacity. 
Narcissists rarely think anything is wrong with them, and there-
fore don't seek treatment. If they do show up at a therapist's, it's usu-
ally because a long-suffering spouse has issued an ultimatum. Even in 
treatment, they rarely get better. Giving them Prozac, self-help books, 
or self-esteem-boosting exercises just tends to increase their grandi-
osity, sense of entitlement, and victim mentality. Therapy feeds their 
egos, often becoming just another source of "narcissistic supply" (self-
focused attention and praise). Similarly, unself-conscious consumers 
rarely think anything is wrong with them. They're prohably married to 
This Is Your Brain on Money 
SS 
another unself-conscious consumer, so they don't even have the spou-
sal pressure to seek treatment, insight, or change. 
\Ne don't yet know what genes, environmental triggers, and ran-
dom events during brain growth lead some people to develop true 
narcissism. But once 1Ne do, it seems likely that those factors will 
overlap with the factors that promote runaway consu merism. The 
environmental triggers for both seem likely to include the relentless 
self-esteem-boosting messages sent to children of certain countries by 
their parents and teachers. Kids told fifty times a day that they have 
"done awesome," regardless of their talents and virtues, seem likely to 
acquire a grandiose sense of entitlement and a penchant for egotistical 
self.indulgence-not to mention an inability to use adverbs properly. 
The Two Faces of Consumerist Narcissism 
Narcissists tend to alternate between public status seeking and private 
pleasure seeking. I believe that these two faces of narcissism are also 
the two key components of the consumerist mind-set. iNe buy things 
for status or for hedonism, to show off to others or to please ourselves, 
to send fake fitness indicators to others or fake fitness cues to our-
selves. Remember that fitness indicators are signals of one individual's 
traits and qualities (good genes, good health, good social intelligence, 
and so on) that are perceivable by others-signals like the peacock's 
tail, the bowerbird's bower, or the consumer's iPod. Generally, animals 
have no conscious awareness that, by displaying fitness indicators, 
they will attract mates, friends, and help from kin; they simply feel 
an urge to do the displays under certain conditions, and they reap the 
evolutionary benefits. 
Fjtness cues, in contrast, are features of an lndi,\lclual's environ-
ment that convey useful information about local fitness opportunities 
ways to increase one's survival chances or reproductive success. Dark-
ncss is a cue for danger (reduced survival chances), so it induces 
fear and shelter seeking. For predators, the scent of prey is a cue for 

56 
S PENT 
food (increased s[ITVi"al chances), so it motivates pursuit, attack, and 
ingestion. For males, the cues that identify fertile females of their 
own species carry information ahout mating oppoctunities (mcreased 
reproductive success), so they motivate pursuit, courtship, and copula-
tion. Our perceptual systems have evolved to pay the most attention 
to these sorts of fitness cues, hecause, in evolutionary terms, they are 
the only things worth noticing about one's world. (Natural selection 
cannot favor animals' responding to any cues that do not identify an 
opportunity to promote their survival or reproduction.) Further, ani-
mals evolve motivation systems to surround themselves with positive, 
fitness-promoting clles (which evolve to "feel good"), and to avoid 
negative, fitness,threatening cues (which evolve to "feel bad"). At the 
evolutionary level, animals are always under selection to survive and 
reproduce. But at the subjective level, they are always motivated to 
chase the fitness cues that feel good-not because they consciously 
understand that natural pleasures are associated with evolutionary 
success, but because they have been shaped to act as if they under-
stood that association unconsciously, 
So, there is a parallel between nonhuman animals displaying fit-
ness indicators and chasing fitness cues, and humans seeking status 
and pleasure, whether as narcissists or COnsumers. This does not mean 
that all consumers should he 
diagnosed with narcissism, hut 
rather, that all human brains have a deep and abiding interest in two 
big sets of evolutionary goals: displaying fitness indicators that were 
associated with higher social and sexual status in prehistory, and 
"h,,,ino fitness cues that wece aSSOciated with beller survival, social. 
and parental prospects in prehistory. These two branches of 
universal human nature spontaneously grow large and malignant in 
the ) percent of us who are true narcissists. These two branches are 
also watered, fertilized, and hot-housed by consumerist capitalism. So, 
narcissism and consumerism are two related ways in which 
drives 
for displaying fitness indicators and chaSing lit neSS cues can 
over 
our Iives--often to the exclusion of empathy, intimacy, friendship, kin-
ship, parental responsihility, and community spirit.

The Two Faces of the iPod 
Almost all advertisements appeal to status seeking, or pleasure seek-
ing, or hoth. An excellent example is the sixth-generation iPod Clas-
sic, released in 2007. It is a "portable media centel" that lits in one 
hand; it is 4 by 2.4 inches in sil.e, about half an inch thick, and weighs 
about six ounces. Yet its alilminum case contains 160 GB of storage, 
which can hold forty thousand songs, twenty-five thousand photos, 
or two hundred hours of vldeo. Its 2.5-inch, 640-by-480-pixel color 
screen can display MPEG-4 movies, TV shows, and games. It can play 
music, podca,ts, or audiobooks for about forty hours on one charge of 
its lithium ion battery. It retails for about $350, However, if you actu' 
filled its hard drive completely with $0.99 songs dovvnloaded from 
iTunes, the iPod's total cost would be $40,000. 
The iPod is not a typical example of "conspicuous consumption" in 
Thorstein Veblen's sense, as it is an affordable little 
that sells 
by the millions. However, it does demonstrate that the two aspects 
of consumer narcissism are often at work even in products that are 
not ostentatious or exclusive. First, iPods display coolness, status, and 
wealth through their sleek deSign, brand recognition, and moderately 
high cost (relative to a typical teenager's allowance). You can custom-
i,.", their appearance by uploading new screen images, covering the 
dick,wheel 
with "wheel art: and covering the whole case 
in '\vrapSt" ,;; bands," or "skins" in any color or texture of silicone) or in 
Icather cases. The distinctive iPod earbuds can be swapped out for 
more exotic,looking Earpollution D33 Earbuds (showing a radiation 
hazard symbol, $13), the Skl111Candy Full Metal Jackets (showing a 
skull. $50), or the Heyerdahl iDiamond ears (each earhud covered in 
204 diamonds; $6,400), 
At the same time, iPods embody the self-stimulation aspect of nar' 
,'i55ism. They play music that no one else can hear, or videos that 
flO one else can see, They are pleaSllre·delivery system" private 
m<,diascapes. They encourage a narcissistic worldview in which iPod

Spent focuses on the showing-off forms of consumer narcissism repre-
sented in the left column, (Gad Saad's 2007 book, The Evolutionary 
/lases of Con" .. mption, dealt a bit more witb the right column,) As we 
will see, a surprisingly high proportion of products are deSigned and 
marketed for shOwing off·--as narcissism projectors, nait amplifiers, 
ness indicators, signals of health, wealth, or virtue_ This has been well 
understood by eve!)' intelligent observer of capitalism since Adam Smith, 
including Thorstein Veblen, Vance Packard, and Robert H. Frank. 
Yet we routinely choose to view consumer narcissism as something 
that other people did in the historical past, or that they do cn other 
cultures and subcultures. We rarely have clear insight into our 0""11 
rorms of consumer narcissism, a fact that is especially true for educated 
citizens in developed economies-such as most readers of hooks like 
Spent. We may feel contempt for the forms of conspicuous consump--
t ion that we consider crass, outre, and infra dig: the Bolo", Hummers, 
;llld McMansions of the aesthetically misguided nouveaux riches_ At 
I he same time) we frame our own less-conspicuous varieUes of con-
"'mer narcissism as natural, reputable, enlightened forms of authentic 
,,-If-expression, merited achievement, and civic virtue. One can hang a

those Iowa State law school grads who work for Monsanto so they can 
buy five-thousand-square-foot tract mansions in Des Moines. 
My point is not that the Hampshire-graduate bungalow owner is hyp-
ocritical-we're all hypocrites these days, one way or another-but rather 
my point is that we cannot track our ever-shifting forms of consumer 
narcissism if we do not cle.arly understand how ancient human instincts 
interact with the modern economy, and how people display their ancient 
psychological trailS through this week's hot new products. 
The Narcissism Premium for Cost-Dense Products 
If we do a little price-comparison exercise, we can better appreciate 
the two faces of fitness-flaunting consumer narcissism. Let's take con-
sumerism at face value as a form of materialism-a way of buying raw 
matter that has been transformed and patterned for human use. How 
can we compare prices and value-densities for very different products, 
mnging from apples to bras to cars to cocaine? We can measure them 
on two fundamental scales: their retaH cost, and the amount of mat-
ter they contain, As economics meets physics, we can ask how many 
dollars per pound a variety of different products cost, and see if any 
notable patterns arise. The table below gives estimates for a range of 
products. (The notes on the book's website give more detail about each 
product's features and how I calculated the cost per pound.)

This table reveals some shocking truths. First, there is a rather wide 
spread of cost densities-an implanted human egg costs .oout 72 
quadrillion times as much per pound as tap water, though the egg is 
constituted mostly of water, plus some chromosomes, membranes, 
and organelles. The implanted egg represents genuine evolutionary 
fitness-successful reproduction itself-the gold standard of human 
value. It carries the most precious cargo that males desire: high-
quality 
from an intelligent, attractive woman. For this, there is 
little supply and much demand, hence a high price. From the view-
point of males, these market pressures apply equally whether the egg 
is obtained from a donor who must be paid by check, or from a wife 
who must be courted by displaying one's kindness, intelligence, and 
wealth. For example, the billionaire Ron Perelman's first three ex-
wives cost several million dollars per child produced, just in divorce 
settlements, and not counting courtship and maintenance costs: Faith 
This Is Your StOlfi on Money 
63 
Golding (married eighteen years, four children, an estimated $8 mil-
Hon settlement), Claudia Cohen (married nine years, one child, about 
$80 million), Patricia Duff (married eighteen months, one child, about 
$30 million). (What it cost these women to bear Perelman and his off-
spring is harder to quantify.) 
Another shocking revelation of the table is how little the basic 
requirements for survival cast. As Adam Smith observed, the two 
commodities absolutely necessary for short-term human survival-air 
and water-are virtually free. \-Vilhout them, we would die respec-
tively in three minutes or six days. The third commodity necessary 
for living a few weeks-basic vegetarian food (grains, beans, fmits, 
vegetables)-is also very cheap, less than $2 per pound. From a sur-
vivalist viewpOint, then, everything beyond air, water, and food can be 
conSldered a luxury good. Of course, there's much more to evolution 
than merely survival of the fittest, which is why there are products 
with higher cost densities. 
The basic comforts of modern life-housing, transportation, doth-
ing, basic entertainment-are the next,cheapest goods. costing around 
!l few dollars per pound for a suburban house, Toyota Camry, Levi's 
blue jeans, or a high-definition Sony television. If you're a carnivore 
who eats cows ($12 per pound) or a vampire who drinks human blood 
($45 per pound), you have to pay a little morc for your food. Even fit-
ness in the sense of aerobic endurance costs only $ 75 per pound, for a 
Vision Fitness X6100 Elliptical Trainer, like the one I use. 
We reach the magical realms of consumer narcissism once cost 
density exceeds that of silver bullion ($225 per pound). Here we find 
the first products designed mainly for flaunting or faking fitness. We 
can exaggerate our physical attractiveness (Victoria's Secret bra, breast 
implants, Guerlain perfume, MAC IipsDck), intelligence (TEe tele-
scope, alternative-music CDs), aggressiveness (Glock handgun), or 
social status (fake Columbia University diploma, cell phone, Learjet). 
When cost denSity approaches that of gold bullion ($14,000 per 
pound), we see even purer narcissism: luxury status symbols {Role" 
willehes, iPods that are actually full of iTunes songs, diamonds, real 

64 
SPENT 
Columbia University diplomas, van Gogh paintings), luxury drugs for 
improved appearance and performance (Viagra, Prozac, Botox), and 
luxury drugs for pleasure (cocaine, heroin, Ecstasy, LSD). Strangely, 
the patented prescription appearance drugs have about the same cost 
density as the illegal pleasure drugs. What do these three product 
classes have in common? They are fundamentally psychological in 
nature, not material. They all have a fairly direct effect on the own-
er's brain, or on the brains of observers. They entertain our minds or 
impress others' minds. They reach right into our nervous systems, grab 
our attention, jump-start our emotions, and make us exclaim "cool, rad, 
extreme l " Onl), a few of these cost-dense products are directly related 
to survival (kidney transplants) or reproduction (sperm, eggs). Even in 
the thermospheric heights of cost, well above 
gold's stratosphere, 
we seem willing to pal' as much per pound for fake fitness as for real 
fitness. (i\. fake fitness indicator displays inaccurate information to 
others about one's underlying biological traits, whereas a fake fitness 
cue conveys inaccurate information to oneself ahout the object's likely 
survival or reproductive benefits.) 
Note that for many luxury status symbols, much cheaper fake ver-
sions exist. Real diamonds have 1,100 times the cost density of high-
quality fake diamonds (cubic zirconia, CZ). Real university diplomas 
have 1,150 times the cost density of fake diplomas. From one view-
point, the fakes seem hopelessly cheap and tawdry, hut from another, 
the "real" goods seem absurdly overpriced. Arguably, the diamond 
buyer is overpaying the De Beers cartel by a factor of a thousand Com-
pared with the CZ buyer, for an almost indistinguishable stone. Like-
wise, the Lexus LS 660h L luxury car has three times the cost density 
of the Toyota Camry-which may imply that the reliable, near-luxury 
Camry offers three times the value of the Le.xus, which is also made 
by Toyota Motor Corporation. 
Of course, cost density is not the only possihle way to distinguish 
luxuries from necessities, or to compare the functions of different 
products. We could have compared cost per unit of time (hoUTof enjoy-
ment), taking into account not just goods (such as a Dell laptop cost 
This Is Your Brain on Money 
65 
divided by expected hours of use before obsolescence), but services 
as well (hourly costs for babySitting, psychotherapy, prostitution, uni-
versity lectures, or amusement-park rides). Likewise, we could have 
compared the ratio of final retail price (as for a Lexus car) to the cost 
of raw material inputs (such as steel, glass, rubber, leather). In either 
case, we would find much the same pattern: basic survival goods are 
cheap, whereas narcissistic self'stlmulation and SOCial-display prod-
ucts are "-''Pensive. Living doesn't cost much, but showing off does. 
Product >veight is, however, especially misleading for informational 
goods such as music CDs and porn DVDs, whose contents could 
be downloaded digitally as very lightweight patterns of electrons. 
Most such informational goods are also clear cases of self-stimulation 
or social display, since they can't have any real-world effects except 
through one's own or other people's senses. For these reasons, they are 
likely to have extravagant costs that can't be attributed to their male-
rial utilitl'. 
FinaUy, many important things are notable for their absence from 
the cost-density table. 
in the twenty-first century, we still can't 
buy true love, respect, or fulfillment. Ifwe're lacking them, we can't buy 
sane parents, successful siblings, or sensible children. We can't even 
buy decent replacements for biological adaptations that go wrong-
artificial eyes, brains, hands, or wombs. Our bodily organs are the most 
value-dense ltems t hat we can call our own. They are beyond 
but we take them for granted until we lose them through accident or

you pay for working sperm or eggs of your own--not just DNA from an 
unknown donor? 
Our inherited legacy of adaptations is literally precious. Even the 
poorest parents give their children vast riches, in the form of senses,

Ult.imately, the fundamental difference in our existence is not

tion tower far above Aladdin's palace as gifts for which to be thankful. 
This is a literal truth that transcends sentimental New Age nonsense; 
if you move the palace to the airless moon, you won't long enjoy its 
agate walls and ruby windows. One of my goals is to reveal exactly 
how evolved human nature engages with our market economy, so we 
can attach the right relative values to organic adaptations versus artin-
cia! products. Fools toast each Other's wealth, whereas sages toast each 
other's health. 
What The Sims 2 Got Wrong 
About Consumer Narcissism 
Consumer behavior is so fundamental to modern life that modern life-
simulation games are largely consumption-simulators. \Ve no longer 
play the 1960 Milton Bradley Game of Life, with its people~pegs in 
little plastic cars, stopping at the "Gel Job" and "Get Married" spaces, 
trying to reach tlie road's end (retirement) with the most money. 
Instead, we play The Sims, released in 2000 by Electroruc Arts, which 
became the most popular computer game in history, selling 6 million 
copies to date, Its follow-up, The Sims 2, released in 2004, sold more 
than a million copies in its first ten days, at $50 each, 
In The Sims 2, the player controls the hehavior of simulated human 
beings (Sims) who live together in houses that are rendered On-screen 
This Is Your 8roin on Money 
67 
in amazing detail. The Sims can be designed from scratch with a wide 
variety of personalities, faCial appearances, and clothing Slyles, The 
Sims can get simulated Jobs (such as doctor, actor, con artist, or police 
officer), and make simulated money, using it to buy simulated furni-
ture, appliances, electronics, decorations, and skdl-building items 
(such as books, chessboards, or fitness machines), The Sims can be 
guided by mouse movements to undertake mundane duties (such as 
cook, eat, sleep, shower, or go to work) and riskier social tactics (such 
as tickle neighbors, slap enemies, grope housemates, or greet extrater-
restrials), The game is fairly open-ended, with no predetermined goals, 
no levels to play through, nO points to accumulate. Yet there are some 
implicit success criteria: most players strive to make their Sims liappy, 
wealthy, well employed, and well networked, and to avoid letting their 
Sims die of hunger, drowning, burning, or electrocution. Technically, 
The Sims 2 is very sophisticated-a fully 3-D agent-based artificial 
life simulation that requires more disk space (35 gigabytes) than any 
PC contained in 1995, 
Computer-game revenue now exceeds that of Hollywood feature 
mms, and The Sims franchise accounts for a substantial portion of 
it. The Sims is a major cultural phenomenon, They are the first com~ 
puter games to crack the gender barrier and successfuUy appeal to girls 
<lnd women, They have huge appeal acrOSS age groups (from preteens 
through the retired) and across cultures (being especially popular in 
North America, Europe, and East Asia). The core games (The Sims, 
The Sims 2) led to the creation of more successful spin-offs ("expansion 
packs") than any other computer game-spin-offs that aUo\\" for exam-
ple, romantic encounters (The Sims: Hot Date, 2001), pets (The Sims: 
Unleashed, 2002), vacations (The Sims: Vacation, 2002), multiplayer 
nnline interaction (The Sims Online, 2002), celebrity status (The Sims; 
Superstar, 2003), college dorm life (The Sims 2: UniverSity, 2005), lIir-
lation in bars and dance clubs (The Sims 2: Nightlife, 2005), running 
"'H1il businesses (The Sims 2: Opcn for Business, 2006), and enjoying 
s('asonallifcstyle products (The Sims 2: Seasons, 2007), 
These ~amcs are also potent educational tools, whereby young 

68 
S PENT 
people can learn a mental model of adult life in ways that formal 
schooling never offers, To succeed in these games, one mllst learn 
how to make ami sustain friendships, keep domestic peace among 
house mates, pay bills promptly, allocate time efficiently, get work pro, 
motions through skills and social connections, and manage household 
renovations and improvements, So far, so good-I'm happy to see my 
daughter play The Sims 2 and learn how to naVigate through the chal, 
lenges of contemporary life, 
Yet the way that human nature is portrayed in these games is wor' 
rying. Rather than a single global happiness score, the Sims have eight 
specific needs to fulfill through buying and using consumer products, 
Five of them are reasonable survival requirements for a social primate; 
hunger (satisfied by eating food), energy (satisfied by sleeping), blad, 
der (satisfied by using the toilet), hygiene (satisfied by showering), 
and social (satisfied by talking in person Or on phone), Three of them, 
though, are a little more nebulous; comfort (satisfied by relaxing, nap, 
ping, sleeping), fun (satisfied by SOCialiZing, playing, or using elec' 
tronic entertainment), and environment (satisfied by decorating the 
house with luxury products and an). The whole rationale for studying, 
working, and buying in The Sims 2 is to fulfill these needs more effi, 
ciently, in less time, A more expensive bed boosts energy faster during 
sleep; a more expensive rediner chair boosls comfort faster', a more 
expensive shower boosts hygiene faster. Since time is the crucial stra' 
tegic resource for Sims, product upgrades are all about saving time, 
rather than flaunting fitness. 
Strangely, The Sims 2 does not simulate social stat liS, prestige, or 
sexual attractivencss, or allow product acquisition to influence these 
qualities. Buying a more impressive bed, recliner, or shower will not 
attract morc friends or mates, Thus, the social-display aspect of nar' 
cissism is completely missing from the game, The subjective,pleasure 
aspect of narcissism, meanwhile, is hidden behind the three nebu, 
lous needs; comfon, fun, and environment. Luxury furniture boosts 
comfort scores faster; luxury TVs, stereos, and computers boost fun 
scores faster; luxury paintings, sculptures, lamps, and decorations 
This Is Your Brain on Money 
boost em~ronment scores faster. By presentmg these three forms of 
self'stimulating narcissism as bask human needs on a par with hunger 
and hygiene, The Sims 2 portrays runaway consumerism as natural 
human behavior, As In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the instincts for 
social display are hidden behind vaguely aspirational drives. 
Thus, the most popular computer games in history teach players 
rhat bourgeois careerism and endless consumption are the twin pillars 
of a happy, fulfilling life, The Sims learn, work, and buy, but they do 
nOt vote, protest, form unions, do volunteer work, give to charity, Or go 
to church. They are economically empowered but politically neutered, 
Iv!arx would have viewed The Sims 2 as the most advanced form of 
cultural superstructure ever developed-3.5 gigabytes of interactive, 
high,resolution, self-inflicted propaganda supporting capitalist ideal, 
ogy and political apathy, No need for fascist goon squads to make kids 
play it at gunpoint m public schools; they willingly play it themselves, 
actually believing it's an escape from the educational indoctrination 
that they call homework 
Psychologically more realistiC life'simulation games would include 
[he two faces of consumer narcissism, Greedy careerist Sims would 
chase self'stimulation through costly products that promise comfolt, 
fun, and environmental aesthetiCS, but that do not always deliver, They 
would chase status cues that promise to advertise their intelligence, 
kindness, and popularity more effectlVely to other Sims than ordinary 
sOClal interaction can, On the other hand, there could also be anti, 
consumerist Sims, who survive, socialize, mate, and reproduce with 
basic appliances in small houses, through minimal work, with plenty 
of leisure. They could enjoy life without buying much, apart from the 
occasional /Idbusters magazinc or Noam Chomsky video, These Sims 
could build their own houses and make their own furniture, Lnstead 
of buying everything at the fuJI manufacturer's suggested retail price, 
I hey could buy things on sale, or used, or from thrift stores. Instead 
of buying a home fitness machine or swimming pool to exerCise, they 
,'ould run around playing tag, or have tickly sex, for free. lnstead of 
s<'eking transcendence in front of big,screen HDTVs, they could 

70 
SPENT 
meditate, pray, or take drugs. They could overturn 
atomized sub-
urban lifestyle by joining cohousing estates wjth communal dining and 
child care. They could even vote for higher-density mixed-use wning 
that combines residential, commercial, and leisure functions in a New 
Urbanist utopia. Alas, such radical-but-sensible options never appear 
in the game's vision of life success. 
This is not to say that Electronic Arts is part of a global consumer-
indoctrination conspiracy, It's just a medium-size company with $3 
blilion in 2006 revenue, employing seventy-two hundred game devel-
opers and support staff who take pride in designing fabulous cutting-
edge games, However, those employees are mostly middle-class white 
American male software engineers, who are living in placid sub-
urbs near Redwood City, California, and who are more interested 
in employee sLOck options and the Best Buy megastore than in Buy 
Nothing Day. Not surprisingly, they tend to channel their own Silicon 
VaHey workaholie-shopaholic values into the needs and aspirations 
of their Sims. And when we play their games, we tend to internalize 
those same values so our Sims can prosper.

The Fundamental Consumerist 
Delusion 
SO, WHAT AilE we really trying to show off with our products? Super-
ficially, consumer narcissism allows people to display their wealth, 
status, and taste. Yet these are maddeningly vague terms. "Wealth" 
indudes not just assets and income, but the borrowing power to obtain 
house, car, and business loans. It depends on a little three-digit number 
called a credit score, which reflects one's history of being a profligate 
borrower who repays loans conscientiously enough to be dependable, 
but slowly enough to be profitable to lenders. 
major U.s. credit 
reporting companies (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) also take into 
account personal factors such as employment history, residence sta-
biliry, and debt-la-income ratios. Thus, wealth as borrowing power 
depends largely on the mental traits of high conscientiollsness (which 
predicts gainful employment, fewer missed payments, and lower bank-
ruptcy risk), and high intelligence (which predicts education, income, 
and learning enough abom the credit system to Own the optimal num-
ber of credit cards), 
Further, not all wealth is seen as morally equal. We make fine 
discriminations between wealth acquired "legitimately" through the 
meritocratic, pro-social ideals of individual hard work that helps oth-
ers, versus wealth acquired through inheritance, 
windfall, 
gambling, or crime. Wealth takes on a different connotation if it is dis-
played by an organic farmer or brain surgeon, as opposed to an arms 
dealer, supermodel, lottery winner, Enron executive, Afghan warlord, 
cult leader, gold digger, or rent boy. We make different attributions 
about the personality, intelligence, and moral traits of wealtby people 
based on the sources of their wealth, and pure wealth displays are not 
generally infonnative ahout such ttaits. To overcome this ambiguity 

72 
S PEN r 
about all the traits beyond wealth, many luxury goods are "positioned" 
to signal more-specific aspects of the owner's identIty (that is, per-
sonality traits)< For about $50,000, one can buy any of the following 
new sedans: a new BMW M3, Cadillac CTS-V, Jaguar S-type, Lexus 
460, or Lincoln Town Car These five models are deSigned and 
branded to convey very different impressions about the owners' traits 
and their likely sources of wealth, which I shamelessly stereotype as 
follows: 
• BMW M3: dlVorced 40-year-old male assistant district a!torney 
who needs small rear seats for weekend child custody, and 
knee-weakening acceleration for dates with leggy criminal 
defense lawyers 
• Cadillac CTS-V: single 19-year-old rap star, recently signed by 
Inrerscope Records, soon to lose driving license through D\iVl 
convictions 
• 
S-type; separated 50-year-old female real estate 
agent who used to be a pole dancer; proud not to have used 
OxyContin in the past six weeks 
• Lexus GS 460: 35-year-old lesbian professor of cultural 
studies, recently tenured for a book on the 
of condom 
packaging, cohabiting with female krav maga instructor who 
drives a Subaru Outback 
• Lincoln Town Car: married 75-year-old couple who ran a 
modestly successful John Deere tractor dealership in Plano, 
Texas; proud to be American 
However, all such pOSitioning requires additional advertiSing effort to 
create s)'mbolic associations between the brand and the aspirational 
traits it embodies, including the specific source and form of wealth of 
prospective buyers. 
"Status" is an even more elusive concept It basically means any-
thing that provokes social interest, attraction, or deference< In any 
specics of social primate, a hrgher·status animal is simply one who is

looked at and groomed more often by others, who can displace others 
from desired resources such as food, and who is solicited more often

is done by other people: one's status dwells in the minds of observers. 
Politicians have no more status than what is granted to them by vat· 
ers, media pundits, and corporate ca mpaign donors. Scientists have nO 
morc status than what other scientists award them through citations, 
talk invitations, and tenure< "Status" makes a misleadingly concrete-
sounding noun Ollt of many social verbs distributed among many 
observers. Status is what we confer on one another-usually through 
other individuals' Judgments on physical, mental, personality, and moral 
traits. Beauty raises status. Creativity raises status< Emotional stability 
and articulate leadership during group emergencies raise status< 
There are as many types of status as there are types of individual 
differences between people< Individual differences in intelligence are 
substantial, stable, and highly predictive of behavioral competence 
across many domains, so differences in intellectual status exist. Indi· 
vidual differences in kindness and agreeableness are substantial, sta-
ble, and highly predictive of altruistic behavior across many domains, 
so differences in moral status exist. So, here again, when we speak of 
buying products to display our status. we really mean buying products 
to display the fact that our physical, mental, or moral traits are supe-
rior to those of other people in some comparison group< Like "wealth;' 
"status" boils down to a type of superiority with regard to some set 
of individual-differences dimensions that have already been noted, 
judged, and validated byothers< 
'Taste" admits an even broader diversity of interpretations, as one 
person's elegance is often another person's kitsch. It is not easy to 
"flaunt your taste," as the Hennessy cognac ads suggest, in a way that

of the beholder. Rather, it means that taste is a way for us to sort one 
another out, to choose friends and mates based on similar aesthetic 
and moral criteria that reflect commona}jties of intelligence. personal-
ity, ,md ideology. Common ground in aesthetics, morals, and personal-
ity traits make it easier for people to coordinate their behavior with one 
another for their mutual benefit. Similar tastes make similar stimuli, 
ideas, and behavioral tactics more salient to each individual. In game-
theory terms, they make it easier for people to coordinate on certain 
"focal points" in "coordination games." Por instance, if I anange to 
meet an old friend in London on a particular date, but we forget to 
specify an exact time and place to meet, it would help enormously 
if we could anticipate one another's tastes and thinking styles. Most 
people know that meeting at noon is a mOre salient focal point for find-
ing one another than trying to meet at any other particular time, such 
as 2:4J a,m. People eat lunch around noon, so meeting at a restaurant 
might make sense. If my friend and I know we have similar prefer-
ences concerning food, price, and location, and know what those pref-
erences are, it's much easier to find each other. We would meet at the 
Wagamama noodle bar near the British Museu m. 
Conspicuously displayed aesthetic taste is a convenient, visible 
way for people to display their deeper personality traits. Por example, 
if I were rich, J would collect paintings by the contemporary artist 
Fred TomaseHi, rather than the usual Post-Impressionists or Abstract 
Expressionists collected by Upper East Side hedge-fund managers. 
Why) Because I find Tomaselli's work visually and intellectually richer, 
and I appreciate 
biological materials, compositlonal skills, and psy-
chedelic themes. In other words, I would want mv art collection to 
reflect my personal!aste, meamng in this case I wo;ld (unconsciously) 
want it to proclaim my openness (to weird hallucinogen-inspired art, 
and to images of Hfe's spooky transience), conscientiousness (esteem 
for artists with an obsessive-compulsive attenrion to de!ail), and mtel-
lil'I'llce (appreciation of quasi-conceptual art and knowledge of semi-
obscure twcnty-first-century artists). 
I'""",".l taste should not just attract like-minded individuals; it

should also repulse differently minded ones, To be effective, It must 
be a high-risk, high-gain form of taste signaling, rather than a meek 
nod to the least common denominator. The Tomaselli paintings would 
be effective for my social-screening purposes because few people of 
low openness could bear to sit through a dinner party with such d.s-
orienting works on the walls. They would feel existential nausea and 
never come back. On the other hand, visitors who admired the work 
articulately, without gagging, would reliably signal their higher open-
ness. Conversely, Christians can repulse atheist intellectuals like me 
by hanging black-velvet Jesus paintings on their walls, just as Van Hel-
sing repelled vampires with garlic. 
Thus, while it is superficially true to say that products display our 
wealth, status, and taste, these terms do nothing morc than dip a tim-
orous toe into the shallows of scientific inSight. Real understanding 
of how we convey om traits through om consume, behavior must, I 
think, be anchored in a few key facts: 
• We are social primates who survive and reproduce largely 
through attracting practical support from kin, friends, and 
mates. 
• We get that support insofar as others lliew us as offering 
desirable traits that fit their needs. 
• Over the past few million years, we have evolved many mental 
and moral capacities to display those desirable traits. 
• Over rhe past few thous<,nd years, we have learned that these 
desirable traits can also be displayed through buying and 
displaying various goods and services in market economies. 
The most desirable trailS are not wealth, status, and taste-these are 
just vague pseudo-traits lhat are achieved and displayed in widely dif-
ferent wavs across different cultures, and ones tnat do not show ve,y 
high stability \lIithin individual lives, or very high heritability across 
generations. They exist at the wrong level of description to be scien-
tifically useful in connecting consumer psychology to evolutionary 

76 
S PEN T 
psychology. Rather, the most desirable traits are universal, stable, 
heritable traits closely related to biological fitness-traits like phySical 
attractiveness, physical health, mental health, intelligence, and per-
sonality, When we rcally want to find out about someone-as a poten-
tial friend, mate, co-worker, mentor, or political leader-these are the 
traits we are most motivated to assess accurately. Consumerism's dirty 
little secret is that we do a rather good job of assessing such traits 
through ordinary human conversatiof), such that the trait-displaying 
goods and serviceS we work so hard to buy are largely redundant, and 
sometimes counterproductive. This raises the question: Why do we 
waste so much time, energy, and money on consumerist trait displays' 
The Social Psychology of Consumer Narcissism 
The whole edifice of consumer narcissism rests on 
questionable 
premise that other people actually notice and care about the products 
that we buy and display, Sometimes they do, hut often they don't, and we 
overestimate how much they actually do , This is a deep failure of hum an 
soda I psychology, Under natural conditions, \Ve are generally rather 
good at doing perspeelive-taldng---imagining other people's points of 
view, and understanding what they notice and care about. Although we 
humans are better at perspective-taking than any other animal, we are 
far from perfect, especially since we have come to live under evolution-
arily novel, unnatural conditions, such as being swamped in consumer" 
ism and spoiled for choice amid branded products. 
Advertisements for most products converge on one key message: 
other people will care deeply what products we buy, display, and use, 
At first glance, this message sounds absurd-SOcially implausible and 
easily disproved by talking with others. However, given that we're 
exposed to about three thousand ads per day repeating some version of 
this message, it's hard 10 remain skeptical. The result is that we greatly 
overestimate how much attention others pal' to our product displays, 
through which we are unconsciously striving to show off ollr key bodjly 
and mental tmits, We also underestimate how much "Hention olhers

pay to more natural forms of trait display that can be judged easily and 
accurately in a few minutes of observation and conversation. 
S crious/y can you remember anything specific worn by your spouse 
Or best frie~d the day before yesterday? Can you remember what kind 
of watch your boss wears' The brand of your nearest neighbor's din-
ing room table! The face of the last person you saw driving a Ferrari? 
Probably not, unless you have the obsessive consumer fetishism of 
American Psycho's protagonist. Mostly, we just don't carc what kinds of 
products strangers display, except for a few domains in which we have 
a profeSSional or personal interest: dentists notice your teeth; hobby-
ist jewelry makers notice your earrings, (We may know what kmds of 
cars and clothes our friends and mates own, but we've already learned 
about their deeper traits anyway, so their product choices don't carry 
much further information,) 
In fact, decades of social psychology research suggest that we auto-
matically notice only a few basic traits when we see people: their size, 
shape, age, sex, race, familiarity, relatedness, and attractiveness. We 
also notice special states of physiology (sleep, injury, sickness, preg-
nancy) and emotion (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, elation), Through-
out human evolution, these have been the most significant things to 
notice about people, because they carry the most crucial implications 
about how we shou ld interact with them to promote our own survival 
and reproductive prospects, It was always important for females to dis-
tinguish between their babies, sisters, boyfriends, and stalkers, It was 
not so important that they notice exactly what kind of furs, beads, or 
body paint each individual was wearing, except when they were useful 
in assessing a stranger's sodal status. 
Indeed, the traits that are most salient and relevant to people are 
precisely the traits that remain hardest for purchased products to signal 
reliably-Of to misrepresent credibly, It is very difficult to buy goods or 
,crvices that can notably alter ones apparent age, sex, or race, or that 
can disguise one's broken leg, oral herpes, or basic emotions, A $15,000

other cues of age on the neck and hands. A sex change through hormone 
therapy and sex reassignment surgery (also about $]5,000) can transform 
apparent sex in some ways, but has Bttle effect on height, torso shape, 
fadal bone structure, or the sexuaUy differentiated brain that grew in 
utero--much less on ones ability to reproduce as a member of the oppo-
site sex. In each of these situations, our sodal-perceprual systems for rec-
ognizing key human traits and emotions are hard to mislead, because 
they have been evolving so long to be accurate. They have become very 
efficient at vacuuming up all the information they can fTom all the differ-
ent cues that can be perceived from an individual's body, face, language, 
and behavior. 
After we notice people's key demographiC and physical traits, we 
seek information about their mental traits. We want to know a few 
basic things about how their brains work. How intelligent and mentallv 
healthy are they? \<llhat kind of personality do they have) What mor;l 
virtues do they signaJ through the political and religious beliefs that 
they espouse) These, again, are the traits that carry the most predictlve 
information about how to interact with someone. They are also the traits 
that we have evolved to assess most qUlckly and reliably through the 
normal prehistoric modes of interaction: greeting, eating together, and 
talking. And again, they are the traits that are hardest to fake through 
bought products-though the rest of this book basically details how we 
try to do so, in various self-deluded and ineffectual ways. 
Recent research on "person perceptiOn" suggests that we are really 
rather good at judging other people's intelligence, sanity, and person-
ality from just a few minutes of observing their beha,'ior or talking 
with them. Accuracy can be measured by determining how consistent 
different personality cues are with one another ("convergent valid-
ity"), the degree to which people agree when judging a particular trait 
("inter-rater reliability"), and how well the trait judgments predict an 
individual's future behavior ("predictive validity"). Accuracy tends to 
he higher for more visible traits such as extraversion (talkativeness 
and outgoingness), and lower for more internal traits such as neuroti-
dSil:l (t('nocrtcy to worry, ruminate, and feel anxious). Accuracy is also 
The Fundamental Consumerist Delusion 
79 
higher when we judge a person behavmgin a free, unscripted situation 
that allows individual differences to reveal themselves (as when chat-
ling at a party or living in a smail-scale hunler-gatherer group) than in 
a situation highly structured by social nonns that suppress individual 
differences (as when standing in line at a cash machine or marching in 
a military parade). Observed behavior also carries more reliable infor-
mation when the persons in question believe they are alone, and are not 
constructing a false persona for pubJic approvaL This is why the sight 
of men helping the elderly or rescuing bttens is so attractive to women, 
especially when the men do not know they are being watched. 
The personality psychologist David Funder has summarized many 
of these effects in his realistic accuracy model of person perception. 
His model posits that there are plenty of more-or-Iess objective, reliable 
behavioral cues available to infonn us about most personality traits. 
Our accuracy at Judging those traits depends simply on others' domg 
or saying things that express these relevant and informative cues, and 
on our notlcing, perceiving, and judging the cues appropriateJy. These 
personality cues can include every aspect of how people talk, move, 
and dress-everything from how they pronounce "Coethe" to how they 
discuss Neil Caiman's graphic novels; everything from their walking 
speed to their erotic eloquence when dancing a tango nuevo. 
Funder's model also implies that when personality-relevant infOrma-
tion is not readily available about someone we ","sh to judge, we may 
often create social occasions in which the information becomes more 
available. For example, it may be hard to judge a daughter's boy-friend's 
agreeableness (bndness, ,va<mth, generosity) jf we meet him in a quiet, 
air-condItioned steak house. !V1uch better to invite him over for a mid-
summer extended-family barbecue at wh.ich he is in encouraged to drink 
several beers, and then assaulted chaotically on all sides by ch.ildren, 
dogs, footballs, and stinging insects. If, under these more difficult, dis-
inhibited, and diagnostic conditions, he becomes irritable to the point 
of thrOwing the footballs at the dogs and squirting mustard at the chil-
dren, we know his agreeableness level is rather low (and that he mlght 
have a short temper with our daughter's future babies). Conversely, if he 

80 
S PEN T 
remains calm, cheerful, and helpful as the sweat rolls down his 
flushed, mosquito-stung, dog-licked face, we know his agreeableness 
level is rdlher high, The cultural evolutjon of such occasions for accurate 
personality assessment may explain why major social rituals (dates, job 
interviews, parties, banquets, holidays, weddings, honeymoons) entail 
such long durations, high stress levels, and disinhibiting drugs such as 
alcohol, These conditions bring out both the best and the worst in us, 
Many mental disorders are also rather easy to detect within a few 
minutes, on the basis of appearance, behavior, and conversation, Peo-
ple with major depression tend to slump and look sad; they speak soft Iy, 
slowly, and monotonously; they disparage their lives and prospects 
People with schizophrenia tend to be unwashed, ungroomed, and 
dressed in too many layers of clothing; they have odd gaits and man-
nerisms; their speech is sometimes incoherent, rambling, and delu-
sionaL Other easily observed cues characterize people with anxiety 
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, anorexia, narcolepsy, 
and most personality disorders" Only a few mental disorders are really 
hard to identify from superficial interaction: psychopathy, specific pho-
bias, sexual disorders and dysfunctions, and some addictions, When it 
comes to judging people's sanity, most experienced adults are rather 
accurate, We may not be able to diagnose each peculiarity using the 
current psychiatric terms, but the basic difference between normal 
and abnormal behavior is highly salient, This is especially true when 
we are making judgments about people who may liIJ central roles in 
our lives: potential mates, friends, business partners, and in-laws, Even 
psychopathy-the disorder that is hardest to detect through short-
term individual interaction-can sometimes be detected through gos-
sip about the psychopath's previous crimes and misdemeanors,

This explains why the dating choices made by teenagers have 
always seemed appallingly stupid to their parents" Teenagers are overly 
influenced by the traits that are easiest to assess (physical attractive-
ness and status among peers), By contrast, parents have decades more 
experience in assessing the harder-to-discern traits, such as consci-
entiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, and intelligence, and 
in appreciating the longer-term benefits that these traits convey in 
any human relationship, This ability to judge character was consid-
er~d a major part of wisdom, and a cardinal virtue, before consumerist 
capitalism made concepts like character, 'Wisdom, and virtue sound 
unfashionable, 
Why was evolution so remiss in failing to arm human teenagers 
with sensible mate~choice preferences? One answer is that their pref-
erences may be rather well-adapted to getting good genes in the con-
text of short-term mating, even if they're not so good at finding good 
partners for the sort of long-term relationships that Yleld higher social 
and economic benefits under modern conditions, A second answer is 
that teenagers reach puberty far earlier today (probably due to higher-
fat diets) than they did under prehistoric conditions, when their sexual 
psychology had mOre time to catch up to their sexual physiology" A 
third answer might be that parents ahvays had a fairly heavy influence 
on mate choices made by their teenage offspring, so evolution focused 
on shaping the parents' preferences rather than the teens'" 
In any case, by the mid-twentieth century, it became crucial for 
marketers to convince young people that they could judge one anoth-
ers individuality more effectively through consumerist trait displays 
than their elders could through wise observation" Judgments of one's 
peers and dates by the older generation had to be made to seem old-
fashioned, uncoo!, irrelevant, biased, and prejudlced" I 11 this, the mar-
keters succeeded spectacularly, assisted by tWO key twentieth-century 
ideologies: (1) the egalitarian rejection of the idea that an individual's 

82 
S PEN T 
personality, intelligence, mental health, and moral \'irwes are use-
ful concepts worth evaluating accurately and discussing socially, and 
(2) the environmentalist rejecUon of the idea that these traits show 
stability within individuals (across situations, relal.ionsWps, and ages) 
and witWn families (through genetic inheritance). 
Consumerist capitalism has depended on youth's embrace of these 
blank-slate ideologies, which were sold as thrillmgly rebellious and 
thoughtfu Ily progressive. Throughout most of the twentteth century, 
they seemed validated by psychology, social science, progressive poli-
tiCS, and the self-help movement_ In popular culture, the blank-slate 
ideology convinced the young that the purchase of an)' new product 
designed to display some personal trait was a heroic rebellion against 
the older generation'S outmoded belief in the existence, stability, and 
heritability of personal traits. In the behavioral sciences, the blank-
slate ideology biased generations of scientists against trait psychology, 
personality research, intelligence research, behavior genetics, and any 
other area concerned with individual differences. Instead, the focus 
tumed to psycholOgical processes that were allegedly similar across 
all humans: child development, social cognition, neural information 
processing. 
As long as advertiSing never actually used the old-fashioned terms 
for traits (character, intelUgence, virtue), the young eould buy, display, 
and admire the trait-displaying products, make the social judgments 
they needed to make about one another's traits, and pretend that they 
were hving in a radical new post-trait world. The whole discourse of 
traits went underground, discreetly hidden in the rhetoriC and semi-
otics of branding and marketing. It remained just visible enough for 
,he you og to recognize, unconsciously, which products would display 
which traits, but it was just elusive enough ,hat their anti-trait ideol-
ogy was never threatened, and the person-perception wisdom of their 
parents never seemed relevant to their lives. For example, rap music 
producers such as Dr. Dre reaGzed in the 19905 that the real money 
lay in convincing white middle-dass suburban boys that by buying and 
playing rap, they could display their coolness, attitude, and strcet cred 
The Fundamental Consumerist Delusion 
83 
(that is, their aspirations toward low conscientiousness, lowagreeable-
ness, and high promiscuity)- The white boys obliged by pouring bil-
lions of their parents' dollars through the local music retailers' hip-hop 
sections, while dissing their parents' concerns that white girls might 
actually prefer to date boys who display high conscientiousness, agree-
ableness, and chastity. But if the parents couldn't distinguish between 
DJ Spooky, DJ Spinna, and DJ Qualls, how could they possibly claim 
that the whole rap music industry was just another marketing-driven 
set of costly, umeliable trait displays. or that the trait displays their 
children considered cool were actually repulsive to potential mates, 
friends, and employers" 
Thus, the blank-slate model of human nature, far from challeng-
ing the principles of consumerist capitalism, forms consumerism's 
ideological bedrock. It makes the trait-perception wisdom of older 
generations seem outdated and irrelevant, and makes the trait-display 
aspirations of younger generations seem to require bu)'lng the appro-
priate goods and services, while allowing them to pretend that they 
live in a brave new post-trait world. Most importantly, it undermines 
everyone's confidence that their traits afe real enough and visible 
enough to be appreciated without being amplified and externalized by 
careerism and consumerism. 
The Fundamental Consumerist Delusion 
Consumerism depends on forgetting a truth and believing a falsehood. 
The truth that must be forgotten is that \\" humans have already spent 
millions of years evolving awesomely effective ways to display our men-
tal and moral traits to one another through natural social behaviors such 
as language, art, music, generosity, creativity, and ideology. 'We can all 
do sO without credentials, careers, credit ratings, or crateloads of prod-
uct. Our finest, most impreSSive goods and services have been endowed 
to us by our DNA, in the foml of physical and psychological adaptations 
that naturally display our virtues and naturally impress our peers. Our 
ancestors unwittingly invested enormous effort into huilding up this 

84 
5 PEN T 
genetic legacy of aCCUl1lte trait display through billions of attempts over 
millions of years to win friends, influence people, court mates, choose 
mates, raise children, and show magnanimity to onc another This is 
a coro message fTom evolutionary psychology: the most precious, com-
plex, intricate, and wonderful things in life are the biological adapta-
tions COmmon across all humans-especially the adaptations that signal 
Our individual differences so conspicuously. vVe already have everything 
we could possibly need to impress our fellow humans, yet every maior 
human ideology conspires to make us forget this fact-becau;" ev~ry 
ideology seeks power by convincing us that we need something beyond 
ournaked bodies and minds to be socially acceptable anJ sexually att,ac-
tive. Consumerism has become our mOst potent ideology because it so 
contemptuously dismisses our natural human modes of trait display, and 
it keeps uS too busy--workmg, shOpping, and product displaying---to 
remember what We can signal without all the products. 
Consumerism actually promotes two big lies. One is that above-
average products Can compensate for below-average traits when one 
is trying 10 build serious long· term relationships with mates, friends, 
or family. True, some products can mask personal defects in the short 
term. For a forty-seven-year-old single woman seeking mates, Botox 
can paralyze facial muscles ro reduce wrinkles, hiding some signs of 
age, The treatment might lead a thirty-one-year-old single man to ask 
her for a second date, which he might not have done had her true age 
been more apparent during a candlelit first date. However, that age 
will become apparent sooner or later through other, more reliable cues: 
the appearance of hands and neck in daylight, an i11lroduction to her 
twenty-five-year-old daughter Or fifty-lwQ-ycar-old sister, the invitation 
to her thirtieth high school reunion, and so on, Thc same principle 
applies to almost every other product that tries to enhance physical 
appearance, apparent intelligence, personality, or moral virtues Trait-
enhancing products can fool some of the people in the short term, but 
they can't fool any of the people in the long term. This is why new-
lyweds are more often disappoi11led than delighted to discover tlll'ir 
spouse's true character during stressful foreign honeymoons. 
The Fundomenlal Consumeris1 Delusion 
85 
A second big lie that consumerism promotes is that products offer 
('ooler, more impressive ways to display Our desirable traits than any 
natural behavior could provide. SpeCifically, consumerism assumes 
I hat better products are more effective signals, Any technical improve-
ment in product design or features, and any marketing innovation in 
product branding, is pitched as an upgrade in Signal effectiveness. 
Indeed, if we buy products primarily as Signals of our underlying bio-
logical traits, their Signal effectiveness-----especially as carried by brand 
recognition-is, logically, paramount, while theit efficiency in serv-
ing their nominal purpose (as a garment, appliance, or vehide) IS only 
of secondary concern. This fact is perfectly clear 10 every marketing 
I,rofes,ional, but it must remain perfectly obscure to most consum-
('rs. Advertising must therefore playa coy and suhtle game With the 
<'Gnsumer: while it must hint at the signaling functions of conspicuous 
l'onsumptiol1, it must never make quantirative claims about the rela-
tive Signaling effiCiency of different products, or of artificial products 
versus natural human behaviors. 
Such explicit claims about a product'S trait-Signaling power could he 
proven false 311 too easily. For example, sports car ads aimed at single 
males must imply that driving the car will result in the males' attract-
ing more attention from beautiful young women, But the ads must not 
make that claim explicitll" because it ,,'Ould be too easy for advertis-
ing regulators or rival manufacturers to demonstrate empirically that 
I he sports car's d rivers do not enjoy a sufficient increase in attention 
10 jusrify its price premium, and that a betler sense of humor would 
increase female attention far mOre effectively than eXCeSS horsepower. 
Thus, consumerist capitalism must keep the signaling functions of 
products at the stage's periphery, in the shadowy netherworld of smoke, 
mirrors, curt-ains, veils, video girls, and dream boys, Direct claims that 
a product will increase one's SOCIal popularity Or sexual attractiveness 
could not \vithstand the spotlight of center stage, where the quality of 
one's performance can be judged all too harshly. Instead, the product's 
nominal functions, features, speCifications, novelties, popularity, and 
bmnding must occupy the consumer's conscious attention, while the 

86 
S PE NT 
promise of signaling status and sex appeal must penetrate the uncon-
scious as silently and unaccountably as a stealth bomber Consumers 
must feel that they uniquely recognJze the signaling potential of the 
product from the subtext of the ad, that their desire for social status 
and sex appeal is subjectively legitimate but publicly embarrassing, 
and tnatthey alone can convert the product's technical excellence into 
a dIsplay of personal coolness that yields social and sexual payoffs. 
The consumers must feel that they can enter into a signaling conspir-
acy between themselves, the product, and some hypothetical audience 
of admirers, and that this conspiracy is racy, transgressive, ingenious, 
and somehow even subversive of capitalism itself. 
Even the consumer rights, education, and protection movements 
conspire to promote this delusion. \Vhile Com;umer Reports magazine 
takes great pains to assess empirically the objective features, functions, 
safety, and reliability of products, It never assesses their signaling effi-
ciencies in promoting the consumer's social reputability or sexual suc-
cess. Given progress in social science and consumer-research methods, 
that would actually be rather easy to do, through interviews, question, 
naires, and focus groups, in which people rate how they would react 
ro specific individuals' buying, using, and dIsplaying the various prod, 
ucts, compared with other competing products, and compared with 
other possible behaviors. 
For example, Consumer RepOTlS readers could complete annual 
questionnaires asking not just how often their Corvette Z06 has 
needed brake repairs, but whether the Corvette has actually resulted 
in any new friendships, business partnerships, dinner party invita-
tions from neighbors, or spont>meous sexual encounters with admir-
ing female pedestrians. Even if male Corvette drivers do manage to 
attract a little extra female attention, the math doesn't work out very 
well for them. Suppose a male driver enjoys an average of one extra 
short'term mating per year attributable to his choice of car. The Chev-
rolet Corvette Z06 ($70,000) has a $50,000 price premium Over the 
comparable-size Chevrolet Malibu sedan ($20,000), and both cars are 
designed to become obsolete in about Jive years. Rational car-huyers 
The Fundamental Consumerist Delusion 
could then calculate that the Corvette's price premium of $50,000 
yields an expected five extra sexual encounters during its five-year 
product life, or $10,000 per encounter. By contrast, a typical encoun, 
ler with a professional sex worker costs about 5200, or fifty times less. 
Instead of paying the Corvette's price premium, which might yield one 
encounter per year, the driver could just buy the Malibu and, with the 
cash he saved; have one encounter per week The prospective male 
Corvette-buyer must accordingly either be wildly overoptimistic about 
the car's attractiveness to women, or be very bad at math, or strongly

Flaunting Fitness 
SINCE ABOuT 1990, there have been two bloodless but momentous 
revolutions in human affairs: the collapse of communism in politics, 
and the rise of Signaling theory in biology. Both depended on the same 
insight: individuals work hard mostly because they want to show off to 
others, not for the good of the group. This tendency holds true in both 
organic evolution and human economics. Bowerbirds build elaborate 
nests to attract mates for themselves, not to improve the public aes-
thetics of their New Guinea habitat Likewise, Ukrainian farmers will 
work harder to buy status s}'ITlbols for themselves than they will to 
feed starving neighbors, 
The baSIC insight of signaling theory IS that animals make a lot of 
noise about themselves, but they don't communicate much news about 
the world. We've known ever since Darwin that animals are basically 
machines for survjval and reproduction; now we also know that ani-
mals achieve much of their survival and reproductive success through 
self-advertisement, self-marketing, and self-promotion. Narcissism is 
nothing new; it is the evolutionary norm, as every peacock strives to be 
the brand most favored by peahens. 
Almost all animal signals-bjrdsong, firefly lights, pheromones, 
courtship dances--convey self-promoting information abour the sig-
naler, tlot helpful information about the environment. Instead, most 
animal sjgnals convey little more than the individual's type (species, 
sex, age) and quality (fitness, health, status, fertility). They do not 
include the sort of detailed product spedfications favored by 1950s 
car ads. They just say what kind of beastie you are, and how good you 
are at being your sort of hcastic. Animals scml oucb signals to just a

or food from parents, to threaten rivals, and to attract mates. This is 
"ccomplished not by conversing about topics of mutual interest, but 
hy sending credible claims about one's own needs ("Gimme food l ") or 
qualities ('Tve got great genes, sO you should mate with me'l 
It's easy to claim that one is helplessly hungry or awesomely fit; the 
challenge is to make such claims credibly. This is precisely what sig-
naling theory addresses: how animals can back up their claims, how 
they can send reliable, hard-to-fake signals that will be believed. In 
1975 the. Israeli biologist Amotz Zahavi proposed that high cost could 
Io\uarantee the reliability of quality signals. His "handicap principle" 
suggested that only high-quality animals could afford to waste a lot 
of time, energy, and resources on issuing costly signals, which he 
called handicaps. l\ sickly, starving, parasite-ridden, brain-damaged 
pigeon can't repeat the "mate with me" song a few thousand times 
iln hour; therefore, any pigeon who can repeat the song must not be 
sickly, starving, or otherwise impaired. Tne song's cost guarantees the 
singer's quality. This theory remained controversial until around 1990, 
when biologists understood it clearly enough to develop mathemati-
cal models demonstrating that it works. Since then, Zanavi's handicap 
principle has expanded into modern "costly signaling theory;' which 
is a foundation of modem research on animal communication, sexual 
selection, social mtcraction, and human behavior. 
'When animals use phYSical traits or behaviors to show off, we can 
call these handicaps, or costly Signals, or sexual ornaments, or fitness 
indicators, the term I prefer. As we saw in chapter 5, fitness indicators 
function as both advertisements and warranties: they not only pro-
daim quality, but guarantee it. Indicators attract attention if they are 
costly, hard to produce, and hard to fake. They are ignored if they are 
100 cheap, simple, and easy 10 counterfeit. 
The peacock's tail is the classic example of a fitness indicator. It 
has no survival function, and plays nO necessary role in fertilization. 
It simply attracts peahens by showing off the peacock's health and fit-
Iless, the quality of its genes, and its ability to find seeds and insects, 
and to escape from tigers, Other obvious fitness indicators include th" 

92 
S PEN T 
lions mane, the elk's antlers, and the humpback whale's song. Human 
bodies are also full of fitness indicators that reveal reliable informa-
tion about health and fertility, and that were shaped in part by sexual 
selection to attract mates. These bodily signals of quality include om 
faces, voices, hair, skin, gait, and height-plus female breasts, but-
tocks, and waists, and male beards, penises, and upper-body muscle 
maSS. 1\'lan)' human mental traits may have also evolved as fitness mdi< 
cators, including our capacities for language, humor, art, music, cre-
ativity, intelligence, and kindness. 
Signaling theory applies equaUy to nature and culture. Nature pro-
duced peacock tails: large, symmetrical, colorful, costly, awkward, 
high-maintenance, hard-to-fake fitness indicators. Human culture pro-
duces luxury goods like the Hummer Hi, which is also large, symmet-
rical, colorful, costly, awkward, and high· maintenance. These qualities 
likewise make it hard to fake as a wealth indicator--even if you could 
steal an Hi, you probably couldn't afford its gas or insurance. 
Counterfeiting 
Signallng theory becomes dearer when you think about counterfeiting 
money. Counterfeiting became much easier in the J 990s with digital 
color copiers. printers, scanners, and computer graphic software-
technology that challenged the U.S. Bureau of Printing and Engraving 
to include stronger antlcolJnterfeiting features in the next-generation 
redesign of U.S. currency. The $20 bill is an especially popular coun· 
terfeiting target, since it's the highest·denomination bill commonly 
accepted by cashiers 'Without close inspection. Thus, the upgraded 
Series 2004 $20 bill included several new security features sllch as 
a broader range of ink colors, watermarks and microprinting that are 
very hard to copy or scan, color-shifting ink that is hard to imitate, 
security threads with microprinting that glow different colors under 
UV light, and highly detailed, enlarged, off-center portraits that are 
easy to recognlze hut hard to imitate. 
The common denominators in these security devices nrc con-

spicuous cost and conspicuous precision. The bureau's high-speed, 
sheet-fed rotary Intaglio printing presses are Just too expensive for 
the typical counterfeiter-although once the bureau is equipped, the 
marginal (unit) cost of printing each $20 bill is only four cents. As 
for conspicuous precision, the microprinting, security threads, water-
marks, and detailed portraIts are very complex, detailed, and hard to 
imitate accurately. \A/hen the European Central Bank released 14.5 
billion new bills of euro currency on January I, 2002, they included 
similar anticounterfeiting features, plus even harder-to-fake iridescent 
ink and a hologram foil stripe or patch. 
'To understand the costly signaling theory that explains much of 
consumption, it's easiest to consider how we distinguish "real" products 
from "fake" products-and why we care about the difference. Con-
spicuous cost and conspicuous precision are the two basic features of 
hard-to-fake signals. Zahavi's handicap principle focused on produc-
tioll cost, and the money printers focus on production precision, but 
Illost credible Signals-and luxury goods-include high levels of both, 
and it is both that cheap imitators try to fake. 
Consider gold necklaces, for example: their value depends on the 
weight and purit), of their gold and the quality of their workmanship. 
(:old-plated and hollow'gold necklaces seem fake compared with solid-
~old ones simply because they contain fewer atoms of gold. Likewise, 
10k necklaces (41.7 percent gold-the minimum allowed to be labeled 
"real gold" in the United States) seem fake compared with 18k neck-
laces (75 percent-the minimum for France and Italy). Also, necklaces 
"ast with pilS, bubbles, rough edges, uneven color, and poor soldering 
s('em fake compared with well-made necklaces. In each case, the fakery 
can be detected easily by professionals. Gold content can be assessed 
hy the magnet test (gold isn't magnetic; many base metals such as iron 
"re), the heaviness test (gold is dense, about twice as heavy as base 
metals), and the acid test (gold does not react to pure nitric acid, but 
will react to aqua regia-a mixture of nitric and hydrochlOriC acid). 
( 
flaws are easily discernible through a lOx triplet loupe. For a 
dl<'''fl1hrtll, go to your local mall's jewelry chain store with a magnet, a 

94 
S PE NT 
$15 loupe, and $5 bottles of nitric acid and aqua regia, and ask to tcst 
their alleged 14k gold jewelry, This is JUSt the sort of testing we do when 
trying to discern whether a potential mate Or friend is, metaphorically, 
pure gold or merely gold-plated, We don't use magnets and loupes, but 
we unconsciously draw upon even more potent means to assess their 
quality: aUf evolved capacities for conversation, face perception, and 
personality inference, 
As another example, eonsider fake Rolex watches, Computer-
controlled machine tools, Swiss movements, and cheap sapphire crys-
tals have enabled small-scale East Asian manufacturers to flood the 
online market with ever better, cheaper imitations of luxury-brand 
watches. ThiS leads to a signaling arms race: Rolex adds more and 
marc anticounterfeiting features, and the Role.x-imitators learn better 
and better ways to replicate them. For example, a high-quality $1,200 
replica of the Rolex President watch from Replicagod.com is rather 
hard to distinguish from the original (which costs about $30,000), 
because both include a waterproof, shock-resistant Swiss ETA 25-jewel 
movement, a micro·Jaser-etched crown On the dial, a quad-wrapped 
18k gold forged case, a scratchproof sapphire crystal, a 2.5x date mag-
nifying viewer, unique serial and model numbers between the Jugs, 
Luminox hour markers, a black Triplock a-ring seal on the winding 
crown tube, and a Rolex brand hologram sticker. Unless you read the 
expert Rolex identifying gUides by Richard Brown or John Brozek, it's 
very hard to tell a real from a fake Rolex-or indeed to Justify spend-
ing the extra $28,800 for a real one. Similar replica problems afflict all 
the other luxury watch companies, including Breitling, IWC, Omega, 
Patek Phillipe, and TAG Heuer. (Surprisingly, a similar problem is 
emerging in the auto industry: Shuanghuan Automobile in China has 
been able to produce and sell cheaper vehicles that bear very dose 
similarities to the Honda CR-V, the SmartCar, and the BMW X5,) 
Likewise, OVer the course of human evolution, as om capacities for 
judging others have improved, our capacities for deceiving others have 
improved in turn, in a never-ending arms race of social judgment and 
social pretense.

The anns race between real and fake has also undercut the De 
Beers diamond cartel for more than a century, as ever-better imitation 
diamonds have been developed: titanium dioxide (synthetic rutile) 
in the 1940s, synthetiC strontium titanate (Fabulite) in the 1950" 
yttrium aluminum garnet (yAG)in the 19605, gadolinium gallium gar-
net (GGG) in the 1970s, cubic zirconia (CZl in the 19805, and silicon 
carbide (Moissanite) in the 19905. CZ makes an excellent imitation 
diamond; J've made a necklace for my daughter from a perfect, three-
carat, brilliant-cut CZ bought for $4 from a local gem and mineral 
shop, Moissanite, introduced in 1998, is even closer to diamond, with 
a similar hardness, denSity, and luster, yet more brilliance (a hjgher 
refraction index) and more "fire" (a higher dispersion index), Moissan-
ite's manufacturer, Charles & Colvard, advertise it as "not a diamond 
substitute" but as 
entirely new option in affordable luxury," which 
"offers the value, quality, and fastuon that self-purchasing women 
demand, without the emotional heft of diamond." That is, women can 
buy themselves MOlssanite rings without having to deal with engage-
ment to "emotionally hefty" men, Casual observers can't tell them 
apart, nor can most pawnshop owners using the standard thermal con-
ductivity tests for distinguishing CZ from diamond, Only experts may 
notice the subtle double refractions (birefringence) caused by MOls-
sanite's hexagonal crystal structure, SynthetiC corundum is even mOre 
annoying to jewelers, since it is exactly the same aluminum oxide as 
real rubies and sapphires, but it can be made larger, purer (free of 
"inclusions," also known as dirt), and more evenly colored, Thus, "real" 
rubies are inferior to synthetic rubies by any rational measure, though 
they cost a thousand times as much, because their rarity makes them 
more desirable to some. These advances in gem production raise the 
possibility that in biological evolution, too, traits that began as rake 
alternatives to certain signals of qualil:y may have evolved to be more 
useful and even more desirable than the original traits ever were, For 
"xample, verbal humor may have originated as a way for subordinate 
youths to imitate and mock older, more physically dominant sexual 
rivals-until eventually, hwnor becan1e even more attractive than

dominance, just as Moissanite achieved higher brilliance and fire than 
diamonds, 
Finally, consider the problem of provenance in art history. Rem-
brandt painted about 700 pictures, of which only 3,000 are stil.1 in 
eXlStence, , .. UncannjJy, Rembrandts continue to proliferate like 
rabbits, long after his death, Suppose you buy an alleged Rembrandt 
original for a few million dollars, and very much enjoy showing it off at 
dinner parties, and discussing its subtleties of form and shade. Then 
your insurance company's experts determine that it was produced by 
a talented nineteenth-century forger, The painting has not changed 
as a physical object-its subtleties of form and shade should remain 
equaUy laudable-but its value may have dropped a thousandfold. 
\Vhy~ Because it is no longer "real," no longer in the small category 
of Canvases Actually Painted by Rembrandt van RiJn, born 1606. 
Value depends on supply and demand; there is a much larger supply 
of fake than real paintings by Dutch Old Masters, and a much smaller 
demand. (Provenance also matters in mate choice: given two possible 
spouses of equal apparent quality, we generally prefer the one who 
comes from a higher-quality family, meaninga family full of more suc-
cessful and desirable blood relatives. Those relatives carry Some of the 
same genes as the potential mate, so \ve assess them unconsciously as 
a genetic guarantee of the mate's true quality,) 
every kind of high-value product-paper money, gold necklaces, 
luxury watches, diamonds, Rembrandt paintings--there is an endless 
struggle between the real and the fake, the genuinell' valuable and the 
counterfeit The real products tend to include ever more conspicuous 
costs (in raw materials, equipment, time, energy, and innovation) and 
ever more conspkuous precision (symmetry, regularity, complexity, fit, 
and finish). In response, manufacturers of fake products find ways to 
substitute cheaper materials and equipment, to minimize production 
time and energy costs, and to emulate the precision and branding of 
high-quality goods, The fake ultimately illuminates and challenges the 
rcal, as consumers begin to question why they should pay the "real" 
product's premium. Why hot her with a rcnl $8,000 3-carat diamond 
Flaunting FimeM

for an engagement ring, when a $4 CZ stone is indistinguishable to 
most people? Why bother with a real Rembrandt for $10 million when 
you can download a high-resolution digital image of one and commis-
sion your local FedEx Office store to make a visually indistinguishable 
full-size gjdee print of it (with computer-printed color ink on 
can-
vas) for about $200' The fakes reveal what a high proportion of the 
real products cost: a luxury brand markup, a pute profit premium, a 
con. The irony is that, with regard to purely pragmatic: value, the "real" 
version of the product is a bigger rip-off than the "fake" version. 
Signaling theory is best understood by thinking about these issues 
of counterfeiting, cost, precision, and luxury branding. If YOll look at 
any costly Signal, any fitness indicator, you're ahV'dYs looking at a snap-
shot of ongoing coevolution between the real and the fake, The pea-
cock's tail, the lion's mane, the $20 bill, and the Rolex are not static 
designs. They grow ever more costlv, precise, and elaborate over time 
as imitators try to reap the social, sexual, and status benefits of such 
displays without possessing the underlying qualities being displayed 
(litness, health, wealth, or taste). 
Signaling, Branding, and Profit 
If you want to make a decent profit, your product must have a special 
signaling value beyond its nominal function. If a product appeals to 
everyone, it cannot Signal anything about the consumer, so conSum-
ers will simply comparison shop for it On the basis of features and/or 
jlrice. Neoclassical economics assumes this is what consumers do, but 
it is the last thing that real businesses want from consumers, because 
it drives profits roward zero. 
In actual capitalism, corporations strive mightily to avoid competi-
t ion based on mere objective product performance, Instead, they use 
advertising to create signaling systems-psychological links between 
brands and the aspirational traits that consumers would like to dis-
[llay. Although these Signaling links must be commonly understood hy 
Ii", consumer's socially relevant peer group, they need not involve the 

98 
S PE NT 
actual product at alt The typical Vogue magazine ad shows just two 
things: a brand name, and an attractive person. It is irrelevant whether 
the person is wearing any of the brand's dothing. Mere clothing can be 
copied within a few weeks by any coastal Chinese sweat shop. Of len, 
the ad contains no text other than the brand name, no price infor-
mation, no product features, no retailer locations-seemingly nothing 
that could guide a rational consumption decision. 
However, there is a hidden rationality ar work-the rationality of 
costly signalmg. What matters in moSt advertising is the learned asso-
CIation between the consumer's aspirational trait and the company's 
trademarked brand name-the fountainhead of all profitability. 
Often, celebrity endorsements are the easiest way to create such 
an association: the celebrity's traits can be linked to the product brand 
without the traits themselves needing to be identified explicitly. For 
example, Mont Blanc pen ads that feature Johnny Depp or Julianne 
Moore can Create a mental link between the Man! Blanc pen and these 
actors' widely recognized and admired traits (coolness, attractiveness, 
intelligence, sense of humor, emotional authenticity)-without having 
to name those traits as such. These ads also mention Mont Blanc's 
support of the Entertainment Industry Foundation's National Arts 
Education [nitiative, so a further association with generosity and cre-
ativity is established. A similar logic drives the Burberry ads featur-
ing Kate Moss and its contributions to the Breast Cancer Research 
Foundation. In short, celebrities are portrayed in ads not just for their 
name recognition, but for the distinctive traits they are believed to 
have, and these become associated, through the symbolic magic of 
classical conditioning, with the product itself Since celebrities are not 
widely known for their generosity, reinforcement of the status signal 
by the flying buttress of corporate philanthropy helps consumers feel 
better about conspicuous consumption. 
The ad viewer himself need not believe that the brand has any logi-
c.l or statistical link to the aspirational trait he wants to display. He 
must simply believe that ether ad viewers from his social circle will 
perceive such a link If 1 want to look tough, I don't need to believe 
Flaunting Fitness 
99 
that the Hummer HI really looks tough; I need only believe that mOre 
gullible onlookers wi)] think it looks tough, and will credit me with 
toughness for owning it. Thus, all ads effectively have two audiences: 
potential product buyers, and potential product viewers who will credit 
the product owners with various desirable traits. The more expensive 
and exclusive the product, the more the latter will outnumber the for, 
mer. Thus, most BMW ads are not really aimed so much at potential 
BMW buyers as they are at potential Bi\1W coveters, to mduce respect 
for the tin)' minority who can afford the Cars. This explains why BMW 
sometimes advertises in mass-circulation magazines: it is an inefficient 
way to reach their target market of potential BMW buyers but it is a 
very effiCient way to reach the BMW coveters who might respect the 
BMW buyers. Their true target market recognizes this fact, because 
they, too, sometimes read mass-Clrculation magazines, and see that 
their less-successful peers are being educated to understand the semi-
otic power of the BMW 5501. This is how any signal bootstraps its way 
from arbitrary association into common knowledge. 
Advertisers can make errors when they do not understand this sig-
naling logic. De Beers has recently begun advertising diamond rings 
for Single professional women, by trying to introduce a new social con-
vention: whereas traditional engagement rings are for the left hand, 
these Single-woman rings are "right-hand rings:' At first, this sounds 
great: men used to buy diamond rings for theIr fiancees when they got 
engaged, but today there are many wealthy working wOmen who are 
not engaged, and who might nonetheless like a diamond ring. How-
ever, signaling theory suggests this campaign may be counterproduc-
tive. If unengaged women start buying themselves diamond rings, 
and observers don't bother distinguishing right from left ring-fingers, 
then diamond rings will nO longer reliably display that a loving man 
has spent two months' salary on a woman. The diamond's signaling 
rower will evaporate; it will no longer advertise a woman's attractive-
ness, agreeableness, happiness, and faithfulness, but only her earning 
power. ,,vorse, the new synthetiC gem Moissanite is also advertising to 
single women as an inexpensive, undetectable alternative to diamond, 

100 
S PEN T 
and Moissanite marketers aren't even encouraging women to wear 
their rings only on the right hand. If unengaged women are going 
around with $300 Moissanite rings indistinguishable from $30,000 
diamond rings, engaged couples will question the signaling value of 
the diamond ring. They may switch to opal nose studs. 
Why Bother Signaling? 
Costly Signaling theory became important in biology not just because 
it solved some technical problems about how signals can stay reliable 
Over evolutionary time. It also became significant because it clarified 
the diverse and profound benefits of signaling across many species. It 
showed not only how Signaling could work, but, more important, why 
it's worth doing If an animal can credibly Signal its individual quali· 
ties to others, that can bring several key benefits. 
First, one's quality signals can solicit parental care. Young animals 
that credibly signal their prospects for surviving and reproducing can 
solicit more parental care, feeding, and protection. This hene6ts the 
young animal by reducing its chances of dying young, and promoting 
its healthy, safe development, and it benefits the parents by allOwing 
them to allocate their limited time, energy, and food to offspring that 
are most likely to pass on their genes. This pattern, called "discrimina-
tive parental solicitude;' has a dark side, in that parents tend to neglect 
or even kill young animals that display conspicuous cues of genetic 
inbreeding, birth defects, stunted growth, poor health, or behavioral 
incompetence. Perhaps this is why human children try to d.isplay theif 
physical and mental competencies by domg difficult things while 
screeching "Hey, Mom, look what I can dol" They evolved to act as if 
they knew that such displays may be rewarded by fitness·promoting 
forms of parental investment, such as cookies. Children whose physi· 
cal Or mental defects preclude such conspiCUOUS quality signals-
those with Down syndrome, autism, Or congenital blindness, for 
example-are subject to much higher rates of parental abuse, neglect, 
and homicide. Since human maturation is especially slow, and human 
flaunting Fitnes:5 
101 
parents live especially long, parental investment often continues to be 
important throughout young and even middle adulthood. Thus, off· 
spring continue to display their qualities unconsciously to their par· 
ents, by graduating from college, marrying well. becoming law·firm 
partners, ha'ing cute, healthy children of their own, and baking them 
cookies. Children who showed early promise, but who subsequently 
betrayed their reproductive prospects by becoming death-row inmates, 
often provoke some "'ithdrawal of parental affection and investment, 
however unfair and diSCriminatory such decisions may be. 
Quality signals can also be used to solicit care and investment 
from other genetiC relatives. Because relatives share overlapping sets 
of genes, they are shaped by evolution to act as if they have overlap-
ping interests. This is called kin selection, and just as parents have 
incentives to allocate their parental solicitude to the most "deserv· 
ing" offspring (those most able to convert parental care into future 
reproductive success), relatives allocate their familial solicitude to the 
most desen'ing kin. (Indeed, to theoretical biologJsts, discriminative 
parental investment is just a special case of kin selection.) Thus, the 
healthiest, most attractive individuals in an extended-family dan tend 
to elicit the greatest attention and fondness from their relatives. They 
mOre cookies from grandmothers and more job offers from uncles. 
From this viewpOint, family reunions can be seen as periodic rituals 
for mutual quality displays among genetic relatives: each individual 
tries to display his or her physical and mental traits in the best light 
to potential familial benefactors, and at the same time tries to assess 
which relatives arc worthy of receiving his or her generosity. Poor fam· 
may have public·park barbecues while rich families congregate at 
estates in Kennebunkport or Balmoral, but in each case, similar social 
functions are served. Privileges, hopes, expectations, and resources are 
redistributed according to quality inspections of newborns, marital· 
prospect assessments of juveniles, and longevity assessments of the 
elderly. We all want to look worthy to our relatives, to the extent that 
they can do anything for us. 
Moreover, quality Signals can also be used to solicit social support,

alliances, and friendships from nomelalives. This is an important tac-
tic for all animals who live in social groups larger than their kin group, 
who can recognize individuals, and who can support or ignore them 
discriminatively based on previous quality assessments and interac-
tions. Among social primates like tis., such relationships are critical 
for individual survival and reproduction. Popular apes live long and 
prosper; ostracized apes end up dead and childless. So, we have 
evolved irrepresslble instincts to display our individual qualities to 
any potential supporters, allies, or friends who can offer us social ben· 
efits. This is the most ancient form of charisma-based politics, and 
the root of diqueishness and clubbiness. Sometimes its benefits are 
abstract, delayed, and indirect: young·adult popularity yields mid life 
business contacts. But often, especially in prehistory, its benefits were 
dramatic, immediate, and direct: local celebrities are first protected 
and last abandoned under conditions of warfare, starvation, or illness, 
Even Achilles was better defended by his fierce Myrmidons than by 
his allegedly invulnerable skin, 
Finally, quality signals can attmct and retain sexual partners-the 
very gateways tu reproductive success. This is a key factor for all spe-
cies in which females or males hm'e some power of mate choice. Mate 
choice can have profound effects in shaping quality signals, but for 
now, suffice it to say that if the opposite sex is choosy a bout its sex-
ual partners, then one has extreme incentives to display one's quali-
ties both to opposite-sex potential mates and to same-sex rivals, Those 
who display most impressively will attract the highest quality and 
quantity of mates, and deter the highest quality and quantity of rivals. 
enli, quality-signaling process is absolutely central to evolution in most 
sexually reproducing speCICS, including our own. Even if one survives 
to a ripe old age through signaling one's excellence to p,m,nts, kin, and 
friends, one is an evolutionary dead-end if one does not attract at least 
One sexual partner. 
These four modes of signaling often overlap: the Same traits that 
show off one's physical and mental health to parents and kin can 
also a!lmct fTicnds and mates. Beauty and sanity are hroadly valued.

103 
Beyond these four modes of signaling, an individual animal can also 
benefit from quality displays by using them to deter potential preda-
tors from chasing it, to deter potential parasites from attacking it, and 
to deter rival groups from attacking one's own group. In each case, 
one doesn't have to convince the predator, parasite, or hostile group 
that one could never be overcome, only that some other victim would 
be an easier target. Quality signaling to predators and parasites is not 
a central COncern for modem humans in developed nations, since we 
rarely encounter packs of wild hyenas, baboons, or mosquitoes. How-
ever, collective quality signaling to potentially hostile groups is the 
essence of gang warfare, interethnic rivalry, and international politics, 
Conspicuous COrlSU mption at this collective level plays a central role in 
quality Signaling between human groups. Nations compete to show off 
their socioeconomic strength through wasteful publjc "investments" in 
Olympic facilities, aircmft carriers, manned space flight, or skyscrap-
ers. Vv'hile such prestige goods may sometimes work to attract foreign 
investment and tourism, and to deter military encroachment, it can 
also turn irrational. For instance, the United States' determination to 
signal its military and economic superiority through a $3 trillion war 
in Iraq seems to have induced a massive recession that threatens its 
long·term slatus as a superpower. 
The four main reaSons for displaying individual qualities-to solicit 
parental care, kin investment, social friends, and sexual partners-
favor many of the same traits. Your parents, 
friends, and mates all 
attend to yom physical and mental health, because this influences the 
likelihood that you will survive into the future to yield the fitness ben-
ef,ts of their attentiveness. They all care about your pbysical attractive-
ness, because they unconsciously realize this influences 
likelihood 
that you will attract good mates to pass along their genes (if parents or 
kin), or make them look good by association (if friends), or pass along 
their attractiveness to your jOint offspring (if mates), They all care 
about your intelligence, because this influences your prospects of both 
survival and reproduction; your social value as a relative, friend, or 
matc; and your Ronetic value as a mother or father. They all care ahout 

104 
SPENT 
your personality traits and moral virtues, because tliese influence your 
likelihood of being kind, fair, and conscientious in any social role you 
play. So, most traits that are valued in one type of social relationship 
are also valued in olher types, and this is why we strive to display 
those traits conSistently to different social audiences. 
Signals of Body and Mind 
My analysis focuses on products that signal the key human traits-
bodily traits of health, fitness, fertility, youth, and attractiveness, and 
mental traits of intelligence and personality. In some ways, these two 
different classes of traits represent different levels of description for 
the Same human phenotype, the same individual organism. The body 
is the physical phenotype as it appears to others perceptually-through 
vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. \Ve use products such as 
clothing, makeup, cosmetic surgery, and exercise equipment to modify 
the body's appearance so it seems healthier, younger, fitter, more fer-
lile, and more desirable. At a higher level of abstraction, the mind is 
just what the body does with itself-the behavioral phenotype as it 
appears to others, who will make judgments about om intelligence and 
personality. Just as we aspire to make our physical phenotypes (bod, 
ies) look better, we do rhe same for our behavioral phenotypes (minds, 
personalities), by spending money on education, charity, travel, hob, 
bies, and bumper stickers to appear smarter, kinder, more outgoing, 
and more open'minded than we may really be. At a still higher level of 
description, an individual's status, prestige, position, popularity, fame, 
und wealth constitute hjs social phenotype as it is perceived by others, 
and as it emerges through a lifetime of socializing, conversing, ttad-
i "g, friend making, coalition building, and status seeking. We spend 
moncyon luxuries and status symbols to appear more reputable, popu-
lar, and rich, hut because these social trails emerge fairly directly from 
our physical and mental traits, Spent will consjder them in the context 
of the first two levels.

Conspicuous Consumption as Fitness Signaling 
People have radically diverse responses to the very idea of conspicuous 
consumption. Some folks consider it blindingly obvious that most human 
economic behavior is driven by status seeking, social signa ling, and 
sexual solicitation. '[bese include most Marxists, marketers, working-
class fundamentalists, and divorced women. Other folks consider tbis 
an outrageously cynical view, and argue that most consumption is for 
individual pleasure ("utility") and family prosperity ("security"). Those 
folks indude most capitalists, economists, upper-class fundamentalists, 
and soon-to-be-divorced men. Such differences of opinion can rarely be 
resolved by trading examples or anecdotes, or arguing from first prin-
ciples. It more often helps to apply some psychology. So, inspired by 
costly signaling theory, my colleagues Viadas Griskevicius, Josh Tybur, 
and others ran a series of four experiments whose goal was to see how 
people's consumption decisions might shjft as the potential mating ben-
efits of costly signaling became more or less salient. 
In the first experiment, college students came to the lab in small 
groups. Each was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: "mat-
ing" or "nonmaring." Tbe mating subjects looked at three photographs 
of attractive opposite-sex people on a computer screen, picked which 
one they thought was most desirable, and spent a few minutes writ-
mg about an ideal first date with tnat person. 
nonmating subjects 
looked at a street scene photograph and spent the Same amount of 
time writing about the ideal weather for walking around and looking 
at the buildings it featured. Then, all subjects were asked to imagine 
that they had a modest windfall of money (such as a lottery win of 
a few thousand dollars), and to choose which of several conspicuous 
luxuries they would want to buy (such as a new watch, European vaca-
tion, or new car), as opposed to saving the money in a bnnk account. 
Flaunting Fitness 
107 
They were then asked to imagine that they had some extra time avail-
able per week. and were asked to choose how many hours they would 
spend volunteering (such as working at a homeless shelter or helping 
at a children's hospital). The results were dramatic: men in the mating 
condition said the), would spend much mare money than men in the 
non mating condition (for example, they might take the European vaCa-
tion rather than saving that money), but there was no mating effect on 
women's consumption decisions. On the other hand, women in the 
mating condition said they would spend much more time volunteer-
ing than women in the nonmating condition, but there was nO mating 
effect on H""{S volunteering. This study confirmed that conspicuous 
consumption (for men) and conspicuous charity (for women) can be 
increased by thinking about mating opportunities, and so can func-
tion strategically as a form of mating display. 
Because costly signaling theory suggests that signals must be con-
spicuous and publicly observable in order to attract [dends or mates, 
my colleagues wanted to see whether this mating effect applied espe-
cially to conspicuous rather than inconspicuous consumption and 
volunteering. In a second experiment, another set of college students 
were randoml), assigned to similar mating or nonmating conditions, 
Then, subjects indicated how much money they would want to spend 
on the same conspicuous consumption luxuries (new watch, European 
vacation) from study I, or on some new "inconspicUOUS" necessities 
(such as basic toiletries, kitchen staples, household cleaning products). 
Finally, subjects indicated how much time 
would want to spend 
on the same conspicuous volunteering from study I, or on some incon-
spicuous but socially helpful activities (such as picking up trash alone 
in a park or taking shorter showers to conserve water). The result.s 
here were equally dear: men in the mating condition, compared with 
the nonmating condition, said they would spend more money on the 
conspicuous luxuries, and that they would actually spend less on the 
inconspicuous necessities (household cleaning products); there was 
no effect on female consumption decisions. By contrast, women in the 
mating condition, compared with those in the nonmatin" condition, 

108 
S PEN T 
said they would spend more time on conspicuous pro-social volunteer-
ing (such as working at the children's hospital), but no more time on 
inconspicuous pro-social activities (such as taking shorter showers); 
there wa., no effect on male volunteering, So, thinking about mating 
does not simply increase overall consumer spending or pro-social vol-
tmteering; it only increases conspicuous consumption or conspicuous 
charity-the behaviors that work best as public, costly displays, 
It was a bit surprising that in both studies, the mating-primed men 
did not act more conspicuously benevolent, and the mating-primed 
wornen did not spend more on conspicuOlls consumption. lVlaybe 
mating-primed men only favor conspicuously heroic forms of benevo-
lence (such as saving strangers from drowning), and mating-primed 
women only favor conspicuously generous fonns of spending (such as 
bidding high at charity auctions), So, in study 3, another set of stu-
dents followed the same routine as in study 2, except that they could 
choose to spend money on the original forms of conspicuous consump-
tion (such as the new watch or car), or on more generous forms of con-
spicuous spending (such as donating to natural disaster victims at an 
on-campus booth, bidding high at a public auction to raise money for 
sick children). Also, they could choose to spend time and energy on 
the original forms of conspicuous charity (such as working in a home-
less shelter), or on some more heroic activities (such as running into 
a burning building to save someone trapped, distracting a grizzly bear 
from attacking a stranger). As predicted, mating-primed women com-
pared with control-condition women said they would spend more on 
generosity-signaling conspicuous spending; mating-primed men did 
the same. Also, mating-primed men compared with control-condition 
men said they would do more heroic helping, but not more nonheroic 
helping; there was no effect of mating condition on female heroic 
helping. i\1oreover, men \:vho were most interested in promiscuous, 
short-term sexual liaisons showed the largest increase after the mat-
ing prime in both generosity-signaling conspicuous spending and in 
heroic benevolence. This is especially strong evidence that men are 
using these hehaviors as costly mating signals. 
Flaunting Fitness 
109 
If thinking about mating can increase men's heroic benevolence, 
perhaps other kinds of male benevolence might be boosted by mating 
motives-not just heroic acts, but charitable activities that also allow 
men to display their dominance or leadership, In study 4, a final set of 
students, mating-primed or not, indicated how 'Ailling they would be 
to do helpful things that were either low-status (the original five activi-
ties from study 1), or socially prestigious (volunteering with Hollywood 
celebrities in the lVlake a Wish Foundation for terminally ill chil-
dren, or coordinating meetings between charities and White House 
officials), or socially dominant (giving a speech for a good cause to a 
hostile cro,-"d, or leading a risky public protest). Both sexes showed 
a marginally higher interest in socially prestigious pro-social behav-
iors when they were mating-primed. However, only the men showed 
a higher interest in the socially dominant pro-social behaviors when 
they were mating-primed, and this effect was carried mostly by the 
highly promiscuous men who are most motivated by mating effort. 
A fascinating recent paper by Jill Sundie, Vladas Griskevicius, 
and their colleagues replicated these effects in four further studies. 
Inspired by this finding that highly promiscuous men are most influ-
enced by mating primes, they measured interest in short-term mat-
ing using a scale called the "sociosexuality inventorv," Study I showed 
that high-promiscuity men were more willing to borrow fashion-
able clothing from a friend to impress a potential mate rather than 
a new boss, whereas low-promiscuity men would rather impress the 
boss, and women showed no difference. Study 2 showed that high-
promiscuity men who looked at photos of eight attractive women, com-
pared "ith those who looked at photos of eight attractive buildings, 
said they would spend more money on items that were rated by other 
students as examples of conspicuous consmnption (such as designer 
sunglasses or an elaborate car stereo) rather than inconspicuous prod-
ucts (such as low-cost jeans or a toaster oven). There was no mating-
prime shift for low-promiscuity men or for women, and the standard 
questionnaJre for measuring "materialism-'" did not predict conspic-
lI0US consumption. Study 3 showed that the mating-prime effect on 

no 
S PEN T 
conspicuous consumption only works when the potential mating situa-
tion is a short-term hookup rather than a long-term relationship-and 
even then, it only works for the high-promiscuity men. Study 4 showed 
that women rated a man driving a POTsche Boxster as more attrac-
tive for a short-term sexual relationship than a man driving a Honda 
Civic, but the Porsche did not make the man more attractive as a pos-
sible marriage partner. Men rating women were uninfluenced by the 
type of car she drove. This last study is especially intriguing, since it 
suggests that WOmen are attracted to conspicuously consuming men 
for their good genes (which can be obtained from a single copulation) 
rather than their good resources (their wealth as it would be relevant 
in along-term martlage), 
A final study by the evolutionary psychologists Margo Wilson 
and Martin Daly confirmed that mating primes influence economic 
behavior morc strongly among males than females. The)' were inter-
ested in people's "discount rates," which determine how patient people 
are given a choice between a certain number of dollars tomorrow, or 
a larger number of dollars a larger number of days into the future. 
First they measured the discount rate for about two hundred subjects, 
using standard economic-choice measures. Then they asked people 
to look at photographs of potential mates or cars that were prevIously 
rated as highly attractive or unattractive. Finally, they remeasured 
each person's discount rate to see if it had changed after looking at the 
photographs. They found that meo who looked at the highly attrac-
tive photographs of WOmen (from Hotomol.com) s,,~tched to a much 
higher discount rate-they became milch less patient about money. 
Looking at cars had no effect on men's discount rates, and looking ~t 
men had no effect on women's discount rates. (However, women look-
ing at highly attractive cars actually developed a lower discount rate-
a more economically rational attitude better suited to saving up the 
money for buying such a car.) In short, men who saw attractive women 
became much more motivated to get whatever money they could in 
the short term, presumably so they could spend it on c.onspicuous con-
sumption to aUrm.:L m<lt'es.

These nine studies nicely support my key point: milch of human 
economic behavlOr, whether consumption or charity, is engendered by 
motives of costly Signaling to display our personal qualities to potential 
mates and other social partners. These motives are findy tuned and 
very specific. They show systematic sex differences, and arc influenced 
by apparent mating opportunities. Among mating-primed people, they 
especially provoke conspicuous rather than inconspicuous behaviors. 
Among mating-primed women, they especially provoke charitable 
spending rather than luxury spending. Among mating-primed men, 
especially promiscuous men, they provoke heroic, socially prestigious, 
and socially dominant forms of pro-social behavior. Such finely pat-
terned behaviors seem unlikely to arise as a side 
of general 
excitement or arousaL They reveal a human display psychology with 
intricate design features shaped over millennia of evolution. to attract 
mates and friends through certain kinds of costly, risky behaviors that 
reliably signal certain desirable traits.

Conspicuous Waste, Precision, 
and Reputation 
COSTLY SIG1'ALIKG THEORY yields a usefully paranoid perspec-
tive on human behavior, for it leads us inevitably into doubt. It induces 
a vivid skepticism about other organisms' claims of bodily, mental, and 
social superiority. It makes life more unnerving-less like a formu-
laic romantic comedy, and more like a combination of film noir, spy 
thriller, and science fiction. Ultimately, it provokes more than a nod-
ding agreement "ith the observation by nineteenth-centllry American 
minister Elias Root Beadle, that "half the work that is done in the 
world is to make 
appear what they are not." 
'While we have instincts for ostentatious self-display, we also have 
instincts for optimality and frugality, qualities that guided our ances-
tors' choices of how to hunt and gather efficiently, trade profitably, and 
make tOols skillfully. Whereas Thorstein Veblen famously analyzed 
our self-display instincts in The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), 
he also examined our effiCiency-seeking instincts in his lesser-known 
[nsllnetofWorkmanship and the State afthe fndustrial Arts (1914). 
efficiency-seeking instincts can also be applied to eva luate dif-
signaling systems. They lead us to think that we would like to 
be able to judge other people accurately, without their having to handi-
cap themselves so onerously, by wasting so much matter, energy, time, 
am] risk on sigllals. Is then" allY escape from lhis nighuJlaI€ of costly 
signaling, wherein the only alternative to unh'ersal deception is colos-
sal Wd""" 
For a few years in the early 19905, biologists thought there might 
be an answer to this dilemma in the theory of "indexes." Indexes were, 
theoretically, signals that could be perfectly reliable without being 
costly: the quality of one organism's underlying trait would correlate 
Conspicuous Waste, Precision, and Reputation 
113 
100 percent with the apparent quality of a cue being observed by other 
organisms, so the cue would be a reliable index of the trait. Indexes 
might be reliable by tapping into some fundamental constraint of 
Newtonian physics or developmental biology. For example, an anj-
mal's adult body siz.e seemed like a possible index of its genetic quality, 
bodily condition, and age, because mutated, sickly, newborn animals 
simply can't eat enough quickly enough to grow larger-than-average 
bodies. In this view, a four-centimeter-Iong guppy must be a pretty 
good guppy, if guppies average three centimeters; a twenty-five-meter-
long brachiosaurus must have been a pretty good brachiosaurus, if 
brachiosaurs averaged twenty meters. 
However, index theory waS eventually overtaken by life-history 
theory-the study of how organisms allocate their resources, energy, 
and time to different patterns of growth and behavior across their 
life spans. Life-history theory suggested that there was always plenty 
of room for 
even when it came to allegedly reliable indexes. 
Suppose animals evolve to pay more attention to one another's body 
length as a cue of underlying quality when trymg to choose the fittest 
mates or trymg to invest resources in the fittest offspring. There will 
then be selection of mates and offspring to allocate more energy to 
growing longer body parts, to get more than their fair share of copula-
tions or parental care. The body parts that are cheapest to grow lon-
ger, because they have the smallest cross sections (necks and tails), 
will lengthen most qUickly over evolutionary time. Thus, there will 
be a gradual reduction in the correlations between apparent body size 
(length) and actual genetic quality, bodily condition, and age. The 
result will be long-tailed guppies and long· necked, long-tailed brachio-
saurs. Empirical tests of life history theory suggest that such evolution-
ary reallocations of energy from one growth pattern to another growth 
pattern are rather easy to achieve. There are not, in fact, many hard 
"developmental constraints" On organisms that can

happens at the cultural level, as lIIustrated by the counterfeiting of 
paper money, luxury watches, and Rembrandt paintings, 
It would be convenient to Ike in a world of reliable indexes 
merit badges, We could judge books by their covers, people by their 
faces, and products by the simplest of visible cues, Our children could 
prosper by learning a few key proverbs: the bigger, the better; nO pain, 
no gain; like father, like son; might is right; practice makes perfect. 
They wouldn't need to learn that all that glitters is not gold, or thal 
actions speak louder than words, They could keep their innocence and 
gullibility forever, in a wodd of eternal, ubiquitous truth, 
Costly signaling theory is basically the bad news that we do not 
live in that world, because the survival and reprodoctive incentives 
for deception are too high, and the adaptive processes that invent new 
forms of deception--genetic emlolion, cultural invention, individual 
Improvisation-are lao fast and pervasive, 
good news is that some 
signal reIJability is possible, under certain conditions of signal cost. 
Signal cost can certain Iy include costs in terms of an animal's gen-
etal energy budget (food calories eaten) Or ecological resources (such 
as mating territories acquired by threats and fights), which are similar 
in some ways to money. \Vben such moneylike costs are paramount, 
costly signaling theory most resembles Thorstein Veblen's theory of' 
conspicuous consumption, In The Theory of the Leisure Class, Veblen 
argued that luxury goods and services are acquired by the 
mainly: 
to display their wealth, not to increase their 
Buyers of, 
top-of-the·range products understand that their high price is a ben-
efit, not a cost. It prevents poorer buyers from owning the same prod-
uct, thereby guaranteeing the product's reliabilJty as an indicator of 
their possessor's wealth and taste, The rich covet the new iPod not for 
the sounds it can make in their heads, but for the impressions it can 
make in the heads of others, Veblen applied the term "conspicuous 
consumption" to all such costly displays, wherever the main function 
of acquiring, using, and displaying the product is to signal one's indi-
vidual traits, wealth, and status to observers, Costly signaling theory 
simply generalizes Vehlen's insight to tbe biological world, It observes 
Conspicuous Waste, Precision, and Reputation 
115 
that animals, including humans, often show off the most expensive 
signals they can afford, whether those signals are peacock tails or 
Hummer Hls, In each case, reliable signaling demands some sort of 
"conspiCUOUS waste" -a highly visible expenditure of resources that 
brings no material benefir, but that simply signals the expender's abil-
ity and willingness to waste those resources, 
However, the term 
can be misleading, and is not limited to 
biological analogues of monetary cost. Signal costs can also include 
costs in terms of an animal's time (minutes spent doing something), 
attention (proportion of consciousness allocated to some ongoing task), 
diligence (proportion of quality-control systems invested in growing or 
producing a well-formed signal), physical risk (probability of jnjury or 
death), or social risk (probability of embarrassment or punishment jf 
fakery is discovered), In these cases, costly Signals may not demand 
conspicuous waste; they may demand instead conspiCUOUS precision 
(which can be achieved only through time, attention, and diligence) or 
conspicuous reputation (vulnerability to social sanctions), 
Signals that guarantee their reliability through conspicuous waste or 
conspicuous preCision can be called indicators. If they reveal an animal's 
genetic quality or pheootypic condition, they are fitness indicators-
they reveal that animal's fitness, its statistical propensity to survive and 
reproduce successfully under a species' natural ecological conditions, 
The peacock's tail is a fitness indicator that relies partly on conspicuous 
waste (it is large and heavy), and 
on conspicuous precision (its 
finely grown feathers are radially sj1nmetrical at the macro level, show 
evenly spaced eyespots at the meso level, and display iridescence at the 
micro Jevel). 
Most human-designed products show some combination of can· 
spicuous waste and conspicuous precision, The Hummer HI SUV is 
heavy on conspicuous waste (it weighs 7,850 pounds and gets about ten 
miles per gallon), but shows very little conspicuous precision-indeed, 
it shows only enough precision of design and manufacture to run for a 
while before it needs a repair (which happens fairly often, according to 
the Consume". Reports reliability ratings), 
Lcxus L" 460 sedan is 

116 
S PE NT 
somewhat lighter on conspicuous waste (it weighs 4,240 pounds and 
gets ahout twenty miles per gallon), but much heavier On conspicuous 
precision (fit, finish, features, reliabiliry,luxury). 
Apart from indicators, many animals evolve "badges" of fitness or 
starns. These do not rely on conspicuous waste or precision, but on 
conspicuous reputation. Badges may be easy to grow and maintain for 
those who are socially recognized as deserving them. But if indi\1du-
als display them without meriting them, those individuals are subject 
to social punishment by others, ranging from avoidance and ostracism 
to physical harassment and mob violence. For example, facial mark-
ings act as status badges among female paper wasps. Higher-status 
wasps have a larger number of dark spots above the mouth, and spot 
number correlates reliably with head width, body size, and fighting 
ability. The biologists Elizabeth Tibbetts (University of Michigan) and 
James Dale (Simon Fraser UniVuNity) found that if they painted extra 
dark spots on lower-status wasps, those wasps were attacked much 
more aggressively by dominant wasps. Thus, the dark spots may be 
metabolically cheap to produce, but lead to heavy social punishment if 
the wasp does not have the fIghting ability to back up its status badge. 
Analogous human badges include British school ties, military medals, 
and gang tattoos-in each case, unmerited display provokes sanctions, 
ranging from ostracism to death. 
Fot badges to work as reliable signals, they must be checked peci-
odically by other animals to determine if the badge wearer really mer-
its the badge. This could be construed as a "maintenance cost" of the 
badge, but it is a cost borne not so much by the badge wearer as by the 
audience. Others must take the trouble to check for fraud, forgery, and 
cheating, and must impose sufficient punishment on cheaters that low-
status individuals can expect to pay a prohibitive cost for trying to wear 
a high-status badge. This leads to another problem of reliability: detect-
ing and punishing cheaters is inconvenient to the individual (since it 
costs time, energy, and risk), but good for the group (since it keeps the 
badge reliable), so it is technically an act of altruism. Such pro-social 
altruism can he maintained in populations if [he badge checkers and

cheater punishers gain social and reproductive benefits from policing 
the signaling system. But the whole system relies on a complex balance 
of power and interest between honest badge wearers, cheals, police, 
police admirers, and police groupies. If a population gets the balance 
right, badges can be extremely reliable, efficient, and cheap as signals 
of fitness, or status, or anything else. But jf individuals forget to reward 
badge checkers and cheater punishers with extra social status, friend-
ship, and mating opportunities, the system can easily break down. 
Most human-designed products also rely to some degree on status 
badges, whjch are called brands. Brand names and logos are usually 
light on waste (they're small and flat), and only moderate On preci-
sion (they use fairly simple fonts and designs), but they are feroCiously 
protected as badges by trademark law, corporate lawyers, and cargo 
inspectors. Even in China most fake branders have learned to alter the 
imitated brand name JUSt enough to avoid outright trademark viola-
tions, so they produce Paradi (rather than Prada) clothes, PenesemiG 
(rather than Panasonic) batteries, and Pmua (rather than Puma) shoes. 
As with the randomly patterned black dots on wasp heads, the precise 
form and meaning of the brand name or logo are immaterial. Even stu-
pid brand names (Accenture, Babolat, Bong Vodka, Intellocity, Kork-
Ease, and Phat Farm) can succeed if actively promoted and policed. 
All that matters is that the brand is recognizable to consumers, is posi-
tively correlated with some aspect of product quality, and is enforced 
by legal and social sanctions. JUSt as evolution builds badges as Signal-
ing systems by spreading the genes for gro'Wing and recognizing the 
badges, and enforcing tbeir accuracy, corporations build brand eqUIty 
by promoting consumer recognition of the brand, positive association 
with the brand, and intolerance for faking of the brand. Tbe same 
tecognition, association, and reliability consIderations apply to corpo-
ration and conglomerate names above the brand level (Toyota Motor 
Corporation), and to product names wlthin each brand (Camry). 
The table below jlJustrates the differences between conspicuous 
waste, conspicuous precision, and conspicuous reputation as Signaling 
principles.

Each example is arguable, because most real products rely on all three 
principles in varying proportions. In particular, most successful prod-
ucts must display some minimal level of precision in order to function 
efficiently, safely, and credibly for thdr nominal purpose. The Hummer

must run at least as long as the test-drive lasts; Los An!',"'les must have 
streets sufficiently well-organized that commuting to work takes no 
more than twenty-four hours per day. However, none of this precision 
needs to be conspicuous precision-it does not need to go beyond the 
level of pragmatic necessity. Also, most products must bear some rec' 
ogni7.able branding, or else they would not command any price pre-
mium above a generic commodity, and they would not deliver any 
profit to their manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Conspicuous 
waste is also optional if other signaling principles are in play. Some 
products assert their quality through an almost pure mix of conspicu· 
ous precision and branding, without extravagance of scale or materials. 
For example, mDst Skagen brand watches use very thin, simple cases 
of st.ainless steel, precise quartz movements, and discreet branding, 
Of course, conspicuous waste, precision, and reputation do not 
exhaust the possible forms of 'Jgnol reliability. There is also conspic-
uous rarity: pink diamonds, Rembrandt paintings, moon dust, Prin-
cess Diana dresses. Rarity is sO valued by e'<>tic pet enthusiasts that 
whenever a new species is described in the scientific literature, the 
sp,;ci,,, extinction risk is 
by collectors seeking out the high-
premium exOtica-as happened with the tunic Cheiodi"a maordi 
from the Indonesian island of Roti, which brought up to $2,000 on 
the international pet market and then almost went extinct. There is 
also conspicuous antiquity (often correlated with rarity): Roman Dou-
ble Aureus gold coins, Muromaehi period samurai swords, Gutenberg 
Bibles. However, these more exotic forms of signal reUability apply 
mostly in specialist auction markets for unique luxury items, not in 
mainstream consumer-product design and marketing.

For example, socialist and environmentalist critiques of runaway con-
lumerism apply most forcibly to cruder fonns of conspicuous waste, 
wh [eh sequester matter and energy for the rich at the expense of the 
poor, and which impose the largest ecological footprint (resource and 
energy requirements), It is much harder to raise socioecological objec-
tions to an Wod nano than to an Hl Hummer, Aristocrats differ from 
the nouveaux riches not in their freedom from consumerism, but in 
their preference for conspicuous precision and reputation ("the finer 
things in life") over conspicuous waste ("the crass and vulgar"). Green-
minded, dreadlocked vegans differ from well-coiffed soccer moms not 
in their aloofness from capitalism, but in the forms of COnsplCUOUS 
reputation they prefer: Nature's Path Organic Ginger Zing Granola 
Cereal with Silk Plus Omega 3 DHA soy milk, rather than Kellogg's 
Frosted Flakes with factory-farmed milk full of growth honnone, and 
mastitis-induced cow nipple pus, AScientologist who spends $280,000 
on the cult's "intensives" and courses to achieve "Operating Thetan 
Level VIII" status may consider bimself spiritually superior to a Bev-
erly Hills psychiatrist who spends that amount on a Girard-Perregaux 
Magistral Tourbillon Sv,lss watch, but botb are chasing conspicuous 
reputation, just in somewhat different forms. Thus, arguments about 
consumerist capitalism can go far astray when we do not recognize 
that there are many different forms of reliable signaling-and our own 
favored Signaling tactics are the ones we are least likely to recognize as 
signaling at alL 
In many ways, conspicuous waste is the simplest, most popular, and 
(surprise I) most wasteful form of signaling, Guppies and brachiosaurs 
managed to evolve wasteful signals, and the senses and brains to dis-
criminate between them: so, too, have humans. Indeed, conspicuous 
waste is a metabolic extension of life itself. Biologists define life as a 
set of proce.%es that can sustain reproduction (self-replication) and 
metabolism (control over local matler-and-energy flows to preserve 
one's bodily adaptations in the face of entropy). Conspkuous waste 
is Simply a way to display the scope of one's control over those local 
Conspicuous Waste, Precision, and Reputation 
121 
matter-and-energy flows, by monopolizing more resources than are nec-
essary for short-term self-preservation, The payoff of such signaling is 
that it promotes success in the longer-term self-preservation of oneself 
(through higher social status) and one's genes (through higher mating 
success), For example, an active adult male human needs about three 
thousand calories per day" An actively status-seeking bilhonaire enter-
taining thirty guests and twenty staff on his three-hundred-foot mega-
yacht might control the flow of an additional 150,000 calories per day 
for feeding his dependents, plus 8,000 gallons of fuel per day if cruis-
ing at fifteen knots. A gallon of fuel contains about 30,000 calories of 
energy, so the megayacht's total energy budget is about 240 million calo-
ries per day-equal to 200,000 pounds of porterhouse steak, or 80,000 
times the calories needed by the billionaire's own body, A skilled pre-
historic hunter would have been very lucky to bring horne 40 pounds of 
meat in a day, so the billionaire is demonstrating control more than five 
thousand llmes the mek1bolic resources that any normal human could 
command throughout human evoiut10n" Thus, the yacht's food aod fuel 
budget is a prodigious extension of the billionaire's metabolism. 
Thomas Malthus observed that human populations usually expand 
to match the environment's carrying capacity. Given a Malthusian 
world of limited resources, One man's monopolization of such mas-
sive energy flows through a yacht means that other people do without. 
So, when poor, hungry people see megayachts and other conspicu-
ous waste, they tend to get upset, and they either demand socialist 
revolution (in the nineteenth century), or better antidepressants (in 
the twenty-lirst), Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class was a satirical 
tirade against conspicuous waste, but it did not explore the psychol-
ogy of why we lind such waste so aesthetically offensive" His 1914 
book, TI,e Instinct of Workmanship, filled that gap by positing that 
humans evolved, Over millennia of tool-making and technical innova-
tion, a deep instinctive preference for efncienttools, projects, and life-
styles, [n Veblen's view, aesthetic revulsion against conspicuous waste 
reflects this instinct of workmanship, which values precision of design

eftid"ncy of function. Veblen envisioned a technocratic utopia in 
which righteous engineers drove corrupt marketers and investors from 
power, and delivered right-size, minimal-waste products to a grateful 
public. 
Ho"ever, in signaling-theory terms, this instinct of workmanship 
cou ld be construed as simply a different set of signal preferences-the 
preferences that we apply when judging conspicuous precision rather 
than conspicUOUS waste. To a large degree, Veblen's technocratic uto-
pia was achieved throughout much of the twentieth century across the 
developed world, through the aesthetics of international modernism, 
minimalism, and techno-fetishism. These abandoned the conspicu-
ous waste of Victorian ornamentation for the conspicuous preci-
sion of design, form, and functionality-exemplified by Frank Lloyd 
Wright houses, Knoll furniture, Movado watches. and Apple COID-
puters. The rich still bought costly furniture, but it was now eostly 
because designers spent hours trymg to develop new forms of chairs 
that required machinists to invent new fabrication methods tor each 
novel design. rather than because wood-carvers spent hours d1iseling 
Rococo Revival floral motifs into mahogany. 
The twentieth cemury's shift from conspicuous waste to conspicu-
ous precision was beneficial in many ways. It empowered designers to 
explore more creatively the space of possible 
designs. It mini-
mized, for a while, the reputability of grotesque Gilded 
extra;ro-
gance. It paved the way for the cco-aesthetics of "small is beautiful." It 
shifted status from the 
of the very 
(trains, battleships, 
skyscrapers) to the engineers of the very small (electronics, biotech, 
nanotech). It increased consumer appreciation of fit. finish, reliabil-
it)', functionality, and novelty. While conspiCUOUS waste continues to 
be favored in a few places (the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia), 
conspicuous precision has become more fetishlzed elsewhere (Japan, 
Korea, Hong Kong, Europe). 
However, conspicuous preciSion can lead to equally absurd fonns 
of runaway consumerism. If the basic functions of consumer goods 
remain stable, and if form follows function, then modernist d<?sign

should have quickly settled on optimal designs for every product 
category-whether it is the ideal chair, car, or house. Moreover, if con-
sumers demand conspicuous preCiSion, as manifest in perfect work-
manship, quality, and reliability, then every product should operate

many decades, if not lifetimes, passed down the gen-
erations as 
legacies that parallel the biological legacies of our 
genes. Such a system would, however, have resulted in economic 
catastrophe, 
eventually no one would have to produce or buy 
an)'thing. This was the businessman's nightmare of the 1950s, and it 
was solved-with a great deal of explicit strategizing among investors, 
marketers, and politicians-by inventing the various forms of planned 
obsolescence and technological pseudoprogress that journalist Vance 
Packard eXllmined memorably in books such as The Hidden Permad-
e1'5 (1957), The Status Seekers (1959), and The Waste lHake1'5 (1960). 
Corporations realized that if they wanted to continue selling new cars, 
and that if modernist aesthetics dictated that each of a car's functions 
could be served by only a narrow range of optimal design forms, then 
the only way to "improve" each year's new model car was to incorporate 
novel functions that arise through perpetual technical innovation. \Ve 
are all familiar with the parade of improvements that rendered each car 
model "obsolete" within a few years, including: air-conditioning (1941), 
power windows (1948), power steering (1951), cruise control (1958), 
three-point seat belts (1959), and so on. More recently, anxious drivers 
who were once happy with the driver-side airbag (introduced in 1980) 
now feel obligated to upgrade successively with passenger-side airbags 
(1987), side airbags (1995), knee airbags (1996), windowbags (1998), 
nnd second-generation airbags (1998). My 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser 
has only two airbags, so I feel irrationally vulnerable compared with the 
driver of a 2007 BMW 750Li, which has eight airbags-although my 
I ,and Cruiser weighs more and rides higher. 
Thus, consumerist Signaling through conspicuous precision drives 
vcry fast proliferation in product features and functions, often through 
'ninor technical innovations and pseudo-innovations. 
resulting 
waste is not usually obvious within any single product, but is serious

S PENT 
when one adds up all the successively obsolete products that a COn-
sumer buys within a lifetime, If you buy a Toyota Prius (2,900 pDunds 
curb weight) every three ye"fS rather than a Land Cruiser (5,700 
pounds) every ten years, then over a fifty-year driver's lifetime, you'll 
Consume a total of 48,000 pounds rather than 28,000 pounds of car 
mass, Continual upgrades don't always make sense, even when the 
new product has lower environmental costs per mile driven, Similarly, 
a consumer of my generation will have consumed (so far) a couple of 
record players, an 8-track player, several cassette players, many CD 
players, and various iPods-each made with enough conspicuous pre-
cision that they would probably still work, if I could find them, 
'Il,e shift from conspicuous waste to conspicuous preCision reflects 
a gradual dematerialization of consumption, by which we Signal superi-

phones are already becoming too Lilliputian for adult males to use

Yet this dematerialization of products is somewhat illusory, in that 
we have simply centralized the allocation of capital from the products 
themselves to their engineering and manufacturing facilities, A 100-
million-transistor PC microchip may be only one square centimeter, 
but it can be made only in a billion-dollar factory with a million square 
feet of floor space, including 100,000 square feet of "Class I" ultra-
dean area, To aeh,ieve conspicuous preCision in our products, we pay 
companies to cover the capital investments in manufacturing capac-
ity and expertise that are implicit in a produces quality, rather than 
through paying them to invest extravagant capital in each product 
itself. The resull can be marvelous economies of scale, since the cen-
tralized manufacturing capabilities can churn out many products at 
very low marginal costs once they arc up and running, 
Conspicuous Waste, Precision, and Reputation 
125 
Conspicuous reputation represents an even more extreme demate-
rialization of consumption, In this realm, a product's Signaling reliabil-
ity no longer depends on the capital invested in the product itself (as in 
conspicuous waste), or in the product's design and manufacturing <as 
in conspicuous precision), but in the product's marketing and brand-
ing. The product's reputability and the brand's equity exist not in the 
product's material form, but in the brains of consumers and observers, 
Those brains are just as r€<ll as steel or silicon, but because they can-
not be manipulated as directly as ordinary matter Can be, they must be 
reached through the senses: through advertising, product placement, 
opinion leaders, imitation, word of mouth, and all the other arma-
ments of modem marketing, 
In 2006 Interbrandreported that Coca-Cola had $67 billion in global 
"brand equity"-morc than any other company, To non marketers, the 
concept of brand equity (the total value of a brand's name-recognition 
among consumers) usually sounds so abstract as to 
meaningless, 
To marketers, however, it has very real empirical meaning--nameiy, 
that 94 percent of people on earth recogmlC "Coca-Co!a," and most 
"respond positively" to its products, which means that they will pay a 
price premium for a Coca-Cola product over a physically equivalent 
generic beverage, Given a g!obal population of 65 billion people, Coca-
Cola's mind share is worth about $10 perper$On, on average; that is, the 
company's $2 billion of advertising per year over many decades has gen-
erated product recognition propensities tbtt are literally worth about 
$10 per human brain, The other top ten brands-Microsoft, IBM, GE, 
Intel, :-lokia, Toyota, Disney, McDonald's, Mercedes--each have 2006 
brand equity greater than $21 billion, or more than $3 of product rec-
ognition propensity per human brain, These propensities may seem 
elusive, immaterial, even mystical, but they are rea I enough to support 
the careers of hundreds of thousands of marketing and advertising pro-
fessionals, No doubt as the new science of neuroeconomics progresses 
and uses ever more sophisticated brain imaging methods to identify 
which parts of COnsumer brains respond to brands and products, eon-
«'illS stich as brand equity will seem ever less mystical.

Costly signaling theory highlights the fact that brand equity exists 
mostly in the minds 
signal receivers (observers of other people's 
product consumption), not in the minds of signalers themselves 
(actual consumers of a product). The luxury brands with the highest 
brand equity (Louis VuiUor!, Cucci, Chanel, Rolex, Bennes, Tiffany, 
Cartier, Bulgari, Prada, Armani) understand this perfectly well. They 
advertise in Vogue and GQ not so much to inform rich potential con' 
sumers that they 
but to reassure rich potenllal consumers that 
poorer Vag". and 
readers will recognize and respect these brands 
when they see them displayed by others. This is why the typical lux, 
ury ad includes a highly attractive model dressed up as a high,status 
heiress, 
an expression of contempt and disdain for the viewer. 
The ad does not say "Buy this l "; it says, "Be assured that if you buy 
and display this product, others are being well trained to feel ugly and 
inferior in your presence, just as you feel ugly and inferior compared 
with this goddess," 
Conspicuous reputation as a signaling princJple provokes its own 
distinctive moral and aesthetic objections, Critics of branding point 
not so much to each product's material wastefulness or its techno' 
Fetishistic proliferation of useless features and functions, but to its 
in~dlous social, comparison effects. Branded products lead the COD' 
sumer to feel higher in status, sexiness, or sophistication--feelings 
that are ultimately either oppressive (if 
grant higher status 
to the product displayer, and thereby feel inferior) or self,deluded (if 
observers do not actually grant the higher status), In either case, the 
branding seems iniquitous-a waste of human effort, attention, and 
vanity in the zerO'Su m game of social slatus. 
However, in other respects, conspicuous reputation is wonderfully 
efficient as a signaling principle, It leaves a very modest ecolOgical foot-
print, because it relies on lightweight information and media technolo, 
gies to influence people's mlnds. Advertising is just photons aimed at 
eyes, and sound waves aimed at ears, 
can be produced through 
very efficient media-print, radio, television, Internet-that do nOl 
burn much fossil fLld or dub harp seals to death, The principle of con-
Conspicuous Woste, Precision, and Reputation 
127 
spicuous reputation honestly acknowledges the corc function of con' 
sumerist capitalism-the invidious display of one's personal quallt;es to 
observers-and so a L10ws marketers and consumers to fulfill that func, 
tion with less 
to other peopJe, and environments. 
It seems unlikely that people will ever relinquish their runaway 
quest for sel [,display, as the failures of communism and hippie 
utopianism showed all too clearly. (Note that Mikhail Gorbachev of 
the USSR and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones are now both 
appearing in ads for Louis Vuitton luggage.) Yet, people's modes of 
self-display are quite flexible, as shown by the development of dif, 
ferent display normS acrOSS different historical epochs and cultures. 
So, self,display may one day be shifted from om current antisocial, 
irresponsible, unreliable forms of conspicuous waste, precision, and 
reputation to more pro,social, conscientious, reliable forms that still 
let people make a living.

THE BODY IS a practical tool for survival and reproduction. but it is

we can better understand how our self'marketing minds display them' 
selves through our consumer behavior. 
Folk wisdom holds that beauty advertises health and fertility_

ant head hair that will grow long if left uncul, gemlike eyes with big 
white scleras, expressive faces, sensually everted lips, smooth hairless 
skjn, and gracefully dextrous hands_ As Darwin realized, these human 
traits are all the result of sexual selection-generations of our ances'

reliable cues of youth, health, fitness, and fertility in their 
sexual partners Moreover, each human sex has its own luxury fitness

lOrs_ (That might sound obvious, but it's not always easy to fmd good 
empirical support for the allegedly obvious_) There is now strong evi-
dence that these body traits are uniquely amplified in humans, are 
valued as sexual signals, and are dIsplayed mare prominently during 
sexual courtship_ They show 
sex differences, and develop under 
the influence of sex hormones, especially around puberty_ Some of 
these traits (lips, breasts, buttocks, penises) even get engorged with 
blood during sexual arousal. They are salient and sexy, they are costly 
and complex, and they are hard-to-fake signals of survival and repro, 
ductive ability_ They are the focus of visual pornography 
males, 
and narrative pornography for females_ As we age, sicken, or starve, 
our hair dulis, faces droop, lips thin, skin sags, and hands shake_ If 
male, our penises, muscles, and javifs shrink; if female, our breasts and 
buttocks shrink and sag_ Jf our parents were Siblings or coosins, their 
genetic inbreeding reduces our health, fertility, and attractiveness_ If 
we are badly injured, the damage reduces our symmetry of form and 
gf'dce of movement- These traits are both physical fitness-indicators, 
and phYSical-fitness indicators (the hyphens matter here)_ 
These indicators are most reliable at the medium to low end of 
fitness_ Superattractive movie Slars like Anne Hathaway and \VilI

incontinence, jock itch, penis problems, snoring, tics, varicose veins,

Indeed, when we think of the phenomenal range of human bod-

the 8 million people who saw the "Body Worlds" exhibition of plasti' 
nated human corpses, by Dr. Gunther von Hagens, you may remember 
that you couldn't really tell which body had been sexually attractive 
before the skin flaying, muscle dissection, and organ disassembly. If 
you were one of the 3,400 people executed by China in 2004, your 
sex appeal had little influence On the price that your kidneys, corneas, 
ltver, and heart could fetch on the medical black market. Some rich 
Singapore businessman is probably looking happily now through those 
condemned corneas, without prejudice. 
In the cadaver trade (for medical schools and surgical training 
seminars), the big companies such as Innovations in Medical Educa-
tion and Training (IMET) don't Care how cute you were before your 
corpse entered the "tissue bank" supply chain. They'll just pay the

view, 'That torso that you're living in right now is just flesh and bones. 
To me, it's product." Or, as the Stoic philosopher Epictetus wrote 
nineteen hundred years ago, "You are a little soul carrying around a 
" 
corpse. 
I don't want to rock your existential boat with such morbid 
thoughts; I just want you to remember that overall, human bodies are 
really pretty similar, and that we make an enormous fuss over what 
are essentially minor differences. To a short, malnourished, rickets-
warped, Iice-iufested medieval peasant, we would all look as gorgeous 
as angels. To a horny chimpanzee, we would all look like anemic, 
short'armed, sunken-faced chemotherapy patients. '[0 a saber,toothed

cat, we would 
look mighty tasty. Members of the International Bio-
metric Industry Association have to work quite hard to nnd reliable 
automated ways to distinguish people. Typically, this reqwres mea-
suring precise, complex, semirandom surface patterns from tbe ski n 
(fingerprints, hand scans, spectral reflectance profiles), face, iris, or 
voice. To other species and hiometric machines, human differences 
are subtle indeed. 
But the evolutionary consequences of those differences become 
huge when they are averaged aCrOSS whole populations and compiled 
acrOSS thousands of generations. Tiny differences in DNA sequences 
lead to subtle differences in proteins, cells, tissues, organs, and bod, 
ies, which lead in turn to different average levels of reproductive suc' 
cess. \lve evolved to notice these apparently trivial differences because 
in the evolutionary long run, they matter enonnousl,. 
Obviously, many goods and sen';ces are marketed to improve phys-
ical appearance. The most popular and dramatic examples-clothing, 
cosmetic surgery, the fitness industry-have been analyzed by thou, 
sands of researchers. Only the more extreme oddities still surprise, 
and remind liS how much narcissism lurks beneath consumerism. 
One such example is Bust, Up chewing gum, marketed to Japanese 
schoolgirls by B2Up, a Tokyo'based company. It contains phytoestro, 
gens claimed to increase breast size, shape, and firmness (see Bustgum 
,com). Another example is Extreme l\!fakewer, a reality TV show in 
which volunteers are filmed undergoing liposuction, breast implants, 
nose jobs, tummy ll1cks, exercise regimens, and wardrobe upgrades. 
The Rise of the Triathlon 
When the jogging craze swept the developed world in the 1970s, nm-
ners started to compete in marathons. 'vl/hile the Boston marathon 
had been run since 1897, big new annual marathons began sprouting 
up everywhere: New York (1970), Berlin (1974), Chicago (1977), Lon' 
don (1981). The New York marathon, the world's largest, now has to 
limit the runners to thirty-seven thousand per year. 

132 
SPENT 
However, from a fitness signaling viewpoint, marathon-running 
developed a problem: it proved too easy, It soon became apparent that 
almost anyhody between fifteen and fifty-five could finish a marathon, 
if he or she trained conscientiously for about six months. Completing 
a 26.2-mile marathon was no longer an achievement special enough 
to provoke much respect, and winning a marathon became impossible 
for the nonprofessional runner. Even worse, marathon training did not 
give people very impressive bodies. Long-distance runnerS become 
skinny and stringy: men lose their upper-body muscles. while WOmen 
lose their breasts, buttocks. and fertility. Both sexes develop lower sex-
hormone levels and libidos. Finally, marathon-running was too inex-
pensive to serve as a good wealth indicator: all you needed to compete 
was a pair of $80 running shoes. 
Some other form of amateur athletic competition was needed-
one that would favor stronger, fatter, sexier, more lertile bodies, and 
that required much costlier equipment. Voila-the Hawaiian Iron-
man Triathlon was invented in 1977. It required a 2.4-mile swim, fol-
lowed by a 112-mile bike ride, and ended ,,1th a 26.2-mile marathon. 
This contest favored amateur athletes with more upper-body strength 
(for swimming), lower-body strength (for cycling), and fat reserves (to 
avoid freezing in the water, and to provide long,term energy). Today, 
serious triathlon competitors also need to spend at least $5,000 on 
equipment-for example, $550 for a Blue Seventy Helix Full triathlon 
wetsuit, $3,800 for a Scott CR 1 Plasma Pro triathlon bike, plus spe' 
cial energy bars and electrolyte drinks (a triathlon, unlike a marathon, 
requires refueling en route). So, triathlons qUickly became more repu-
tation enhancing than marathons: longer, harder, and more competi-
tive, requiring more muscle, more training, and more money, Insofar 
as ancestral human life also required a balance between the aerobic 
capacity for long-distance walking and running, and the strength to 
carry hunted meat, gathered plant-foods, and heavy babies, the triath-
lete's body also better fits our evolved sexual preferences for the way 
that a healthy, fertile human should look. 
The triathlon is a classic example of runaway I rail display. It not

only required a higher level of physical fitness, but also higher levels 
of wealth, training effort, and conscientiousness. Compared with the 
marathon. it also resulted in a body better suited to human sexual 
preferences for general health, strength, and fertility. The triathlon's 
displacement of the marathon exemplifies a key Signaling principle: 
strong signals drive out the weak. 
Facial Fertility Indicators and Cosmetics 
One of my central claims is that we buy many products in a semicon-
scious attempt to increase the social and sexual attractiveness of cer' 
taiD personal traits. There is little mystery about some of the physical 
traits (breasts, buttocks, hair) that function as fitness indicators, and 
that women display to appear sexually attractive. However, many other 
physical traits function as more-subtle fitness indicators in each sex, 
and are more often displayed in public, and augmented by purchased 
products. \Vomen's cosmetics, for example, teach us a lot about the 
nature of beauty: how certain female facial traits function as indica-
tors of fitness, youth, and fertility. 
The evolutionary background of cosmetics is that in most primate 
species, sexual selection focuses very heavily on facial appearance. 
This is because most primates arc highly social (they care where oth-
ers are looking and what their facial expressions are conveying), and 
highly visual (they care what others' eyes and faces look like). Typically, 
thjs leads female primates to select male primate faces that have some 
absurdly exaggerated sexually attractive features. The whole face itself 
may evolve to be more visually salient, as in the strong light-and-dark 
contrasts that frame the faces of black and white colobus monkeys, 
white-faced sakis, and De Brazza's monkeys. The eyes may evolve to 
be more salient, with Similarly stark contrasts framing the eyes, as in 
the white-nosed monkey, red-capped mangabey, and spectacled lan-
gur. The facial skin or fur may evolve highly saturated colors, as in the 
uakari's bright red face and the mustached monkey's bright blue face. 
These colors may evnlve to be slightly more subtle, as in the pastel 

134 
S PEN T 
blue of the golden snub-nosed monkey, or the pastel pink of the Yun-
nan snub-nosed monkey-------or the colors may evolve to be even more 
garish, as in the mandrill's bright red and blue nose. Other primates 
evolve striking hairstyles, such as the emperor tamarin's mustache, 
and the cotton-top tamarin's mohawk. Facial features may be exagger-
ated to form oversize noses (the proboscis monkey), cheek flaps (the 
orangutan), or pointy crania (the gorilla). 
In each case, male primates have the more dis6nctive and extreme 
appearance, reflecting an evolutionary history of stronger female choice 
on their facial fitness indicators. [n humans, by contrast, sexual selec-
tion has affected each sex's facial features about equally, resulting in 
distinctively male "testosteronized" features (more prominent brows, 
jaws, chins, and noses; deeper-set, smaller eyes; beards) that are 
strikingly djfferent from female "estrogenized" features (larger, more 
prominent eyes; fuller lips; lighter, smoother skin). 
Many cues of female facial attractiveness function not just as gen-
eral fitness indicators that reliably reveal a woman's stable genetic 
quality, but as femlity indicators that reveal whether a woman is at the 
peak of fertility in her life course and in her ovulatory cycle. Female 
humans are unusual in that they become sexually active in their mid-
teens, several years before they are physiologically fertile (which, 
given low-fat ancestral diets, was usually the late-teen years); and they 
remain sexually active long after they have stopped being physiologi-
cally fertile (after menopause). They are also unusual in remaining 
sexually active throughout their menstrual cycles, rather than mat-
ing just when they are at peak fertility, before ovulation. By having 
sex when they are not really fertile, female humans can solicit more 
consistent help, care, and investment from males for themselves and 
their children. This, however, creates a problem for males: If they have 
limited resources to invest in themselves and in different possible 
girlfriends and alleged offspring, how do they choose the investment 
opportunities with the highest likelihood of promoting their reproduc-
tive success' That is, how do they discriminate the truly fertile women 
Self-Branding Bodies, Self-Marketing Minds 
135 
who could get pregnant from the juvenile, postmenopausal, menstru-
ating, or already-pregnant women) 
In assessing women's ages, men apparently evolved to pay dose 
attention to facial and bodily cues of being in the young-adult phase 
of peak fertility. \Nomen's fertility increases rapidly in the late teenage 
years, peaks in the mid-twen6es, and declines smoothly throughout 
the thirties, reaching negligible levels in most women by the early for-
ties. Thus, prehistoric men who felt sexually attracted to pre-fertile 
girls or post-fertile women might have had wunderful, loving rela-
tionships, but they left few descendants to inherit their maladap-
tive preferences. Prehistoric men who felt most sexuaLly attracted to 
peak-fertility women in their late teens through mid-thirties left more 
descendants to inherit their preferences for cues of youthful but sexu-
ally mature fertility 
As an evolutionary counterstrategy, women evolved to develop 
their fertility cues at younger ages in their juvenile life stages, and to 
retain their fertility cues into older postmenopausal ages, in order to 
extract more attention and investment from male mates. In prehis-
tory, there were no birth certificates, driver's licenses, or birthday par-
ties to yield objective indexes of a woman's chronological age. ['"lales 
had no way to assess actual age or fertility; they had only visual and 
behavioral cues of sexual maturity, youthfulness, and fertility. So, 
women could evolve to fake their fertility all the way from around age 
twelve to around age sixty-not just physically but behaViorally. As a 
counter-counterstrategy, men in turn evolve.d more perceptive ways to 
distinguish genuine peak fertility from pseudofertility-and to react 
with sexual impulsiveness to the genuine-fertility cues. For instance, 
when Bill Clinton allegedly had an affair with Monica Lewinsky in 
1995, Monica (born 1973) was twenty-two, near peak fertility, whereas 
Bill's wife, Hillary Clinton (born 1947), was forty-eight, with negligible 
fertility. 
One way of faking fertility across a broader age range is to apply cos-
metics that amplify facial fertility cues that peak in young adulthood, 

136 
S PEN T 
such as plump lips, large eyes, prominent cheekbones, smooth and 
radiant complexion, thick and glossy head hair, and minimal facial 
haiL (Each of these traits distinguishes not only peak-fertility females 
from younger or older females, but also human females from other 
anthropoid apes,) In almost all culwres, women use cosmetics to 
make their facial traits look more similar to those of a mid-twenties 
peak-fertility woman. 
For example, eye size, whiteness, and contrast tend to decline 
after the mid-twenties fertility peak, so women use eyeliner, eye color, 
mascara, brolV pencils, and Visine to make their eyes look larger and 
dearer, and to increase the ught/dark contrast between pupil, iris, 
sclera, lashes, skin. and brows. (Virtually all magazine covers, ads, and 
porn pictOrials also use Photoshop image manipulation to whiten the 
scleras of female models.) The thickness, redness, and eversion of lips 
tends to peak in the mid-twenties as a fertility indicator, so women 
use lip liner, lip color, lip gloss, and lip plumper to make their lips 
look larger and brighter. The prominence and round ness of "cheek-
bones." which are really the pads of estrogenized fat above t he zygo-
matic bones, tend to shrink with age, and the overlj.ing skin loses its 
vasodilated red blush, so women use blush and shading to highlight 
cheekbones. (Many models and actresses also get small silicone pads 
implanted in their upper cheeks, and fat extracted from their lower 
cheeks, to make their cheekbones more prominenL) The translucence, 
radiance, evenness, and smoothness of women's facial skin dedines 
after the mid-twenties, so women use foundation and powder to make 
the skin complexion appear more uniform in pigment and texture, and 
to hide wrinkles. The thickness, length, color saturation, and glossi-
ness of head hair peaks in the mid-twenties, so older women use volu-
mizing shampoos, shine, enhancing conditioners, hair dyes, uighlights, 
hair extensions, and wigs to emulate peak-fertility hair. Conversely, 
they use depilators to minimize facial hair, which tends to grow as 
estrogen drops and androgens increase after menopause. 
Top makeup artists, such as Pat McGrath of CoverGirl, have the 
Self-Branding Bodies, Self-Marketing Minds 
137 
skills to achieve these vouth- and fertihty-enhandng effects with such 
subtlety that casu a I ;bservers cannot tell any cosmetics have been 
used. The result is that when Molly Sims or Queen Latifah appear in 
CoverGirl ads, they look so youthful, radiant, and fertile in such unde-
tectably natural-looking ways that most female readers feel instantly 
outclassed, and desperate to achieve the same hyper-fertile look. (The 
beauty-fertility connection is not usually conscious, in the minds of 
either women seeking to be more beautiful or men seeking women 
who are more beautiful. We have just evolved to act as if we under-
stand the connection.) 
Cosmetic choices are much less culturally arbitrary than they 
appear at first glance. Ancient Egyptians may have used kohl rather 
than liquid eyeliner to increase apparent eye size, red ochre rather 
than blush to increase cheek redness, and mesdemet (ground copper 
and lead ore) rather than foundation to make their complexions look 
more uniform. Yet in each case, they sought to increase rather than 
decrease the facial cues of estrogenization, youthful sexual maturity 
and fertility. Across cultures, people have used different cosmetic 
ingredients, pigments, colors, and bases, and different cosmetic appli-
cation methods, styles, and patterns. Yet I cannot find any cases in 
whlCh cosmetics have been widely used by women in a culture to give 
an impression of small, jaundiced eyes, pale thin lips, or wrinkled, 
pockmarked skm. 
fact that all cosmetics aim for the same youth- and fertility-
enhanCing effects makes it very diflicult to be a cosmetics marketer 
or product developer, because it is so hard to capitali7.e on genuine 
functional innovation in the cosmetics themselves. Pharmaceuti-
cals that genuinely "cure diseases" can be profitably patented after 
FDA approval, but cosmetics that merely "enhance appearance" are 
not subject to the same evidentiary standards or legal protections. 
Instead: cosmetics brands must differentlate themselves mainly 
through packaging and pricing, to appeal to women who differ along 
the dimensions of age, wealth, and apparent sexual availability (if not

actual promiscuity). For example, the WeI'n'Wild brand appe-als to 
Jow-status, self-sexualizing teens, whereas the Shiseido brand appeals 
to !Ugh-status young professional women seeking a chaste image that 
deters sexual harassment at work. Recently, cosmeties have also begun 
br,md differentiating according to more subtle lifestyle dimensions; 
conventional romanticism (Chane!, LOre.l, Lanrome) versus clinical 
chastity (Clinique, Olay, Neutrogena, Prescriptives), versus eeo-friendly 
naturalism (the Body Shop, Aveda, Ecco Bella), versus metrosexual 
urbanism (DuWop, NYX, Smashbox, Urban Decayl. Women will pay a 
high price premium to acguire the brand that they feel best expresses 
their personality-although the chemkal differences between the 
products are negligible, and although most potential male mates have 
no idca that the squat, squarish, black, recyclable tubes of Ecco Bella 
lipstick are supposed to connote environmental awareness, whereas 
the cylindrical, brassy tubes of Urban Decay lipstick are supposed to 
connote cutting-edge, post-goth glamour. 
From Signals of Bodily Fitness to 
Signals of Me.ntal Fitness 
The cosmetics analrsi; above could 
misread as suggesting that 
women display more fake physical fitness cues than men do. In fact, 
a similar analysis could be done of male fashion models, Chippendale's 
dancers, athletes, bodybujlders, soldiers, policemen, ruggedly hirsute 
field anthropologists, and users of anabolic steroids, Viagra, and Rogcine. 
Vanity about physical appearance is an equal-opportunity vice; the 
males just target different physical traits for amplification and display, 
using different products. For instance, men try to build muscle mass 
by buying ultrapremium sustained-release protein powders such as 
Syntha-6, advertised with dose-ups of muscular male torsos that are 
hotter than most of those found in gay porn. Both sexes draw on the 
costly signaling principles of conspicuous waste (enlarged cheekbones, 
hair volume, breasts, and buttocks in women; increased height, mus-
cle volume, and sexual performance in men) nnd conspkuOlls prcci-
Self-Branding Bodies, Self.Marketing Minds 
139 
sian (facial and bodily symmetry, regularity, and smoothnessi minimal 
wrinkles, lumps, and lesions on the skin; fine grooming and clothing). 
And yet many consumers wind up disappointed with products that 
promise to enhance their phySical appearance. They realize that youth, 
health, fertility, and fitness are actually very hard to fake, because 
people have evolved for thousands of years to be very discerning. Our 
perceptual systems evolved the greatest sensitivity and accuracy in the 
tasks that were most important ro our social and reproductive success, 
and assessing others' physica I qualities were among the most critical of 
them. "Ve may not be able to see at a glance which cantaloupe in the 
produce section is ripe (hence more nutritious and carrying fewer phy-
totoxins), but we can see which potentia] mate in the nightclub is "fit" 
(hence more fertHe and carrying fewer genetiC mutations). 
Intelligent adults eventually realize all this, at some level. They stop 
fooling themselves that body-display products actually increase physi-
cal attractiveness, and learn instead that maintaining one's physical 
appearance is an effective way of hroadcasting one's personality traits. 
The consistent, skillful use of cosmetics, razors, hair products, and 
fashion advertises 
intelligence, mental health, conscientiousness, 
and self-esteem. The fortysomething trophy wives of sixtysomething 
movie producers know that they cannot really look better on a purely 
visual, sexual level than the twentysomething aspiring actresses. But 
they do know subconSCiously that, by maintaining a svelte figure, sub-
tly made-up face, and strong fashion sense, they can remind a hus-
band that they still bave sufficient savvy and self-respect to make a 
useful ally in parenting and networking, or a formidable opponent in 
divorce court. Likewise, the ex-college-quarterback who maintains 
his fonn and energy after twenty years of marriage [s displaying not 
so much his phYSicality as his moral self-restraint against the tempta-
tions of sloth and gluttony. Thus, even t be apparently superficial use of 
appearance-enhancing products can, among mature consumers, signal 
a wide array of mental and moral traits, rather than just bodily traits of 
hea.lth, fertility, or fitness.

Looking'Tough in World of Ware raft 
Consumer narcissism can be seen most clearly in tbe virtual worlds 
of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), which are great 
natural experiments For investigating human behavior. For example, 
ahout 9 million people globally playa MMOG called World of War-
craft (WoW), marketed by Blizzard Entertainment. In WoW, players 
create a virtual character who is one of ten races (such as human, 
dwarf, gnome, ore, or blood elf), and one of nine classes {such as war-
rior, shaman, rogue, or hunter)c The characters run around in a three-
dimensional Virtual world fanning teams, fighting monsters, trading 
items, and accumulating character levels (which range from I to 70) 
depending on amount of game experience. Online players can see one 
anothercs characters rendered in very high delail and vi,id color, so the 
visual appearance of one's character and the items ir Owns (especially 
its weapons 
are a major source of pride and social status 
within the gaming commlmity. 
My colleague 
Mendenhall analyzed conspicuous consump-
tion in WoW by looking at the auction-market prices of different weap-
onsc Each weapon has a set of game-relevant attributes determined 
by the game designers, such as the "damage per second'c it typICally 
inflicts, its "durability" (the time until it breaks), and its "critical strike 
bonus" (its chance of inflicting an extra,damaging attacklc While 
these quantitative attributes wholly determine each weapon's actual 
utility in the game, some weapons look a lot cooler than others, and 
are more impressive to other players. These appearance-based features 
of the weapons are indexed hy 
"rarity" color level, which can be 
white (common), gr~Aen (uncommon), blue (rare), or purple ("epic," or 
very rare)c For example, purple swords look larger, more exotic, and 
more distinctive than green swords, They are also objectivc]y better 
weapons (With greater damage per second, durability, and other useful 
qualities), but we wondered whether weapon rarity in itself might be a 
source of social status for players, and whether they might pay a price 
premium fDr rare weapons. 
Self-Bronding Bodie" Sel~Morketing Minds 
141 
In online chat associated with the game, players often discuss 
by name rhe rare, high-status weapons that they own, want, or have 
observed. For example, in online WoW dialect, they might say: 
"vVhodi, 411 flash. u c that 170 pallyin SM with Cataclysm's Edge?" 
"NFW IlRC, it doe., 138 dps? WEG. Better than my vendor trash" 
'·=:-D. OMG, sick wep, sick tankl If he got torqued, I would shit

"Friend, consider this interesting nOwSc Did you see that level,

purple-level s"~ml, Cataclysm's Edge?" 
"No feasible way_ If I remember correctly, that sword does 138

than my 
commOn weaponryc" 
"(Scared grin expression.) Oh my God, what a cool weapon, and 
a cool, physically intimidating warrior' If he got angry at me, I would 
react WIth extreme distress. (Gigglesc) Talk to you later." 
IVlendenhall and I focused on the simplest "melee" weapons (swords, 
axes, and daggers) that cause damage at short range, and on tbe green, 
blue, and purple rurity levels that are favored by almost all players. 
We analyzed just those weapons tbat could be auctioned to other 
players through the WoW online market for an auction price deter-
mined by supply and 
and that could also be sold back to a 
nonplayer character in the game for a vendor price determined by the 
game designers. This yielded a sample of 309 specific weapon models, 
each of which is owned by thousands of different players around the 
worldc (We excluded two superweapons with special hard-to,quantify 
powers and astronomical auction prices-the Night Blade dagger and 
the Bl.inkstrike sword.) We expected that conspicuous consumption 
effects would lead to weapon rarity's having a much bigger effect on 
a weapon's auction price (which reflects the premium players will pay 

I tl2 
S PE N T 
for cool-looking weapons) than on its vendor price (which reflects a 
wcapon's objective attributes)_ 
This is exactly what we found: rarity has a far larger effect on a WoW 
weapon's auction price than any of its game-relevant attributes, explain-
ing 33 percent of price variation_ Median auction prices were 157 silver 
pieces for green weapons, 2,923 for blue, and 11,099 for purple_ By con-
trast, a weapon's vendor price is 95 percent explained by damage per sec, 
ond, and not at all by rarity (median vendor prices were 90 for green, 120 
for blue, and 467 for purple-differences that became Insignificant ;,nen 
contrDlling for damage per second). Thus, WoW players are Willing to pay 
a premium of about ten thousand silver pieces for purple,rarity weapons 
that look big, cool, and exotic, even controlling for the better quantita-
tive attributes of those weapons_ Such coolness displays work because 
most rare weapons are acquired not through auction, but through being a 
high,status expert player who has spent hundreds of hours going on suc-
cessful quests with large, competent guilds of mends. 
The advantage of analyzing conspicuous consumption in such vir' 
tual worlds is that there is no wiggle room for arguing that the luxury 
good has some hidden quality Or performance benefit that justifies its 
price premium_ BrvI\.v may claim that its IlL,(UIy'car premium reflects 
hard,to-quantify aspects of handling and drivability_ No such claims can 
explain the purple-wea)Xln premium In World of Warcraft, because the 
quantitative wcapon attributes that are made publicly available by Bliz-
zard Entertainment wholly aplain the weapon's objective utility 10 the 
game_ In this online game, we have caught people red, handed paylog 
huge costs just to impress one another. My argument is that such 
are ubiquitous in the real world, too, and that the alleged hidden qual, 
ity and performance benefits of luxury goods are typically illusory-just 
'-ague ways for consumers to rationalize their consumer narcissism. 
The Body Goes Mental 
Most animals have very little behavioral control over their physical 
appearance_ They can groom themselves to keel' i'calhers or fur clean, 
Self-Bronding Bodies, Self-Marketing Mind, 
but they cannot select a different species, sex, age, shape, color, or body 
texture, Ever since humans invented body ornamentation at least a 
hundred thousand years ago, however, we have been able to transform 
our bodies in ever mOre dramatic ways_ Tribal peoples wear animal 
masks; British civil servants cross,dress; children play dress,up; the 
Florida elderly don toddler-bright colors. As people do more of their 
SOCializing through virtual,reality worlds such as \Vorld of Warcraft 
and Second Life, their \~sual appearance is becoming less constrained 
by their true physical characteristics, and more constrained by their 
pSl'chological traits, such as aesthetic preferences and idealized self-
images. Virtual-reality users will soon be able to create avatars that 
resemble a mini, Mao, a Botox syringe, a manUs-legged cantaloupe, a 
pearl necklace, Nigella Lawson, or the evil Archimandrite Luseferous 
from the lain M. Banks novel TlwAlgebmi:lt. Such customized avatars 
will reveal nothing about the physical appearance of the users, but a 
lot about their psychology. They will demonstrate more forcefully than 
ever before that consumerism is not about owning material objects, 
but about displaying the son of personal qualities analYLed in the next 
chapter.

we die. We are all one species, yet individual differences loom large. 
We notice not just physical differences between one another, as dis-
cussed in the previous chapter, but psychological differences. This 
is because, as William James noted, "There is vcry little difference 
betvveen onc man and another, but what there is, is very important." 
A century of psychology has identified six major dimensions of vari-
ation that predict human behavior and that arc salient to us.TI,ese are 
the key individual differences that distinguish human

versal aCross cultures and even across many animal species. If you 
know how somebody scores on each of these "Central SL'" traits, you 
can infer a lot about his character, capabilities, vjrtues, and viccs. 
Also, as we'll see in the coming chapters, these six trajts are abso-

fundamental traits that \ve try to display to one anothcr through the

Central Six traits, and are useful in getting a sense of what these traits 
really mean. Here are some examples that seem 10 advertise higher- or 
lower-than-average general intelligence:

other members of the Central Six are the Big Five personality 
traits: openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, stability, and extra' 
version. These are more recent discoveries, dating back from around 
1980, and they have revitalized the study of human personality. They 
dearly and efficiently map the main individual differences io human 
behavioral dispositions, and they are much more reliable and valid 
than other ways of describing human personality in psychology or 
marketing. Like general imelligence, the Big Five traits predict behav, 
ior rather well across different domams of life and different kinds of 
relationships. Like Lntel!igence, they are genetically heritable, stable 
across life, and universal across cultures. Like intelligence, they are 
very salient when we choose social or sexual partners. They can be 
represented by the letters 0, C, A, S, and E, and they can be reliably 
measured by several different personality questionnaires. 
o is for openness to experience: curiosity, novelty seeking, broad, 
mindedness, interest in culture, ideas, and aesthetics. Openness predicts 
emotional sensitivity, social tolerance, and political liberalism. People 
high on openness tend to seek complexity and novelty, readily accept 
changes and innovations, and prefer grand new visions to mundane, pre, 
dictable ruts. They want to shine on like crazy diamonds. People low 
on openness tend seek simplicity and predictability, resist change, and 
respect tradition. They are usually more conservative, dose,minded, 
conventional, and authoritarian. They don't mind feeling comfortably 
numb. High-O people tend to join strange new start,up cults. whereas 
10w,0 people tend to follow the same-old, better· established cults that 
their grandparents followed, which constitute the various organized reli, 
gions. Openness correlates positively (l>ut modestly) with intelligence, 
but also with certain types of mental illness, such as bipolar disorder 
("marnc depression") and mild schizophrenia ("schlzotypy"). 
Here, again, are some real bumper stickers that seem to advertise 
different levels of openness:

C is for conscientiousness: self-control, willpower, reliabihty, consis-
tency, dependability, trustworthiness, and the ability to delay gratifica, 
tion. Conscientious people pursue long, term goals. They fulfill their 
promises and commitments, resist impulses and bad habits, and feel 
emhedded in a network of mutual social obligations. In Chinese terms, 
they tend to build strong guanxi-a strong, reliable social network. 
They like to make plans, keep everything organized, seek perfection, 
crave achievement, and prefer doing one f<x,used task at a time. People 
low in conScientiousness tend to be more comfortable with sponta-
neity and chaos. They accept things, people, and achievement levels 
that are "good enough" rather than "optimal," and they shift more eas-
ily among ongoing tasks. Yet they also sho",> lower levcls of drive and

ambition Conscientiousness predicts regular nttendance at school 
and work, completion of assignments on time, cooperativeness in 
professional relationships, and civic engagement. It predicts eating a 
healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding drug addiction, and staymg 
healthy. Along with intelligence, it is one of the two traits most desired 
by employers. On the other hand, because conscientiousness predIcts 
effective contraception use, it is strongly disfavored b)' natural selec-
tion in the modern world, Extremely high conscientiousness shades 
over into obseSSive-compulsive disorder and results in overwashed 
hands, whereas extremely low conscientiousness shades over into 
reckless impulsivity and results in long criminal records, Low conscj· 
entiousness is moderately related to one of the two main dimensions 
of mental illness: the "externalizing" djmension associated with child-
hood "conduct disorder" (delinquency), adult "antisocial disorder" (psy-
chopathy), and "substance abuse" (alcoholism and drug addiction).

A is for agreeableness: warmth, kindness, sympathy, empathy, trust, 
compliance, modesty, benevolence, peacefulness, Saints are very 
agreeable; psychopaths are very disagreeable, People high in agree· 
ableness lend to seek hannony, adapt to others' needs, 
keep 
their opinions to themselves when doing so avoids conllic!' People 
low in agreeableness lend to seek glory or notorjety, pursue their 
own needs, and express their opinions forcefully, Agreeableness is 
perceived not just as a personality trail, but as a moral trait. It cor-
responds to what most people would call "good" as opposed to "evil," 
"altruistic" as opposed to "selfish," "peaceful" as opposed to "aggres-
sive." (Personalit y psychologists hate to sound judgmental about traits, 
so they try to avoid such moral terms,) Agreeable people often make 
much more pleasant long-term sexual partners, friends, relatives, in-
laws, co-workers, and babysitters, so we often value agreeableness in 
others, In game-theory tenns, the agreeable make better reciprocators, 
and contribute more to public goods, because the)' value other peo-
ple's well-being ("subjective utility"), not just their own, Their motto 
is: "Wnen in doubt, give," Disagreeable people, on the other hand, 
Can often take social 
sexual advantage of otbers, so there Can be 
major evolutionary benefits to disagreeableness, especially for males, 
(This is why most wild animals are rather disagreeable, and why most 
humans, like other domesticated species, are much more agreeable.) 
People low in agreeableness can be cold, distant, aggressive, irritable, 
selfish, and arrogant; they lie, cheat, steal, rape, and kill more often, 
Their motto is: "\Vhen in doubt, take" Low agreeableness, even more 
than low conscientiousness, is related to the externalizing dimension 
of mental illness (delinquency, psychopathy, alcoholism, drug addic· 
Lion), and with various nasty beha\~ors that impose high costs On 
others (promiscuity, philandering, wife beating, child sexual abuse, 
reckless driving), Both agreeableness and conscientiousness tend to 

150

increase from early adulthood to middle adulthood, while external-
izing decreases, 
lronicaUy, bright people with low agreeableness often make the 
most revolutionary creative contributions in the arts 
sciences, 
because they want to leave their mark on the world and don't much 
care what others deem to be conventionally correcL \Vhen you think 
of people whose public personas seem low in agreeableness (hence 
high in social dominance and tough-minded independence), don't 
just think of Joseph Stalin or Dick Cheney. Also think of Elizabeth 
I, Isaac Newton, Frank L1o),d Wright, Ayn Rand, James B. Watson, 
Margaret Thatcher, Quentin Tarantino, and comedians Larry David 
(of Curb Your Enthusiasm) and Sarah Silverman (of Jesus Is Magic). 
Also, low-agreeableness "bad" boys and girls can be more sexually 
attractive than "nice" boys and 
at least for shon-term mating, 
since they are perceived as more 
self· confident, eXCiting, 
and cocky.

(The low-agreeableness category bO<Lsts an extraordinary wealth 
of examples, perhaps because it deters tailgating and preempts road 
rage.) 
S is for stabilit)', espedally emotional stability, Stability means adapt-
ability, equanimity, maturity, stress resistance. People high in stability 
are 
usually optimistic, calm, at ease, and quick to rebound 
from setbacks. People low in stability are neurotic; anxious, worried, 
self-conscious, depressed, pessimistic, quick to anger, qUick to cry, 
and slow to rebound from setbacks. Low stability corresponds with 
the "internalizing" dimension of mental illness that is associated with 
distress (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder) 
and fear (phobias and panic disorder). High stability correlates posi-
tively with general mental health and general happiness, including job 
satisfaction and marital satisfaction, In fact, in the developed world, 
emotional stability predicts overall life satisfaction more strongly than 
does mcome or any of the other Central Six traits.

E is for Extraversion: how friendly, gregarious, talkative, funny, 
expressive, assertive, active, excitement seeking, and socially self-
confident one is. Extraverts are social; introverts are loners. Almost 
all psychologists from Carl lung onward have agreed that extraver-
sion is a key dimension of individual differences. Shyness arises as a 
combination of low extraversion and low stabilit y. Extraverts also show 
higher "surgency',-higher levels of activity, power, dominance, and 
self-confidence, They show a lot of positive emotions, prefer working 
with and trusting olhers, enjoy leadership, and prefer being physi-
cally active. They go to parties more and drink more. They are more 
sexually ad'>enturous and unconventional. Low extraversion is not just 
associated with shyness; it is also associated with social passivity and 
low levels of social status seeking. People low in extraversion tend to 
suppress positive feelings, prefer working alone, prefer hemg physically 
passive, and are less trusting and less indined to seek leadership roles. 
Since extraverts are more active and meet more people, they tend to 
have more friends and sexual partners.

GOCASE (pronounced "go-case") is a silly but useful acronym for 
remembering these Central Six, conjOining the general-intelligence trait 
(G) and the Big Five personality traits (0, C, A, S, El, One can think 
of GOCASE as a social judgment heuristic: when we meet someone 
new, we can ask ourselves, is this person, a specific case of humanity. 
a "go-case" With whom we should go ahead and keep talking to find 
out more, Or a "stop-case" whom we should stop interacting with and 
gently extricate ourselves from? If we meet strangers at a party, and 
we judge that they are reasonably similar to us on a sufficient number 
of the Central Six GOCASE traits, it is usually worth tafung more 
with them. The same is true if we are meeting a neighbor, potential 
employee, lirst date, or second cousin at a family reunion. In each 
case, a surplus of intelligence can compensate for a deficit of stability 
(symptoms of neuroticism); a surplus of agreeableness (warmhearted-
ness) can compensate for a deficit of extraversion (reserve or shyness). 
We don't often meet adults who are very high on the Central Six traits 
that best predict social status (intelligence, conscientiousness, sta-
bility, extraversion), because they typically become so successful so 
quickly that they rarely interact with ordinary folks like us, (Think 
Oprah Winfrey, Tony Blair, Ani DiFranco, Elton John, Jodie Foster, 
Denzel Washington.) Conversely we don't tend to meet adults who are 
very Iowan intelligence, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, 
and stability, because they're already dead, or in high-security psychi-
atric prisons, or protected by Secret Service agents. 
Most of these traits are so universally recognized and valued that 

154 
S PE N T 
they even appear in The Sims computer games that simulate consumer 
behavior. The Sims have five personality dimensions in these games, 
",hlch are pretty similar to some of the Central Six: 
• playful versus serious (which is comparable to high versus low 
openness) 
• neat versus sloppy (high versus low conscientiousness) 
• outgoing versus shy (high versus low on the social facet of 
extraversion) 
• active versus lazy (high verSUS Jow on the surgency facet of 
extraversion) 
• nice versus grouchy (high versus low agreeableness) 
The game deSigners at Electronic Arts may not have read much per-
sonality psychology, but they did intuit which individual differences 
drive human social interactions and consumption preferences. (They 
didn't include stability as a Sims trait, because hlghly stable Sims 
would be highly happy regardless of their material or social circum, 
stances, so they'd short'circuit the whole point of the game, which is 
to make one's Sims happy through their income, consmnption, and 
social networking.) 
1\11 human cultures seem to have their own terms for these traits, 
and to value them when selecting mates, friends, and business associ-
ates. For example, an individual's reputation in Chinese society has 
depended for centuries on two key attributes: mumz; and 'ian. Mianzi 
concerns other people's perceptions of a person's status, prestige, or 
"face," which would usually reflect his general intelligence and extra-
version. A loss of miami v.'Duld entail a loss of authOrity, respect, and 
influence. Lian concerns other people's perceptions of a person's 
moral virtues, which would usually reflect his conscientiousness and 
agreeableness. A loss of !ian would entail a loss of trust and perceived 
virtue-which could have terrible consequences when social and busi, 
ness relarions are based on moral reputation rather than contract law. 
Personality traits exist not only across human cultures, but also 
The Cenlral Six 
155 
across animal species. The biologist David Sinn has shown that a 
basic bold-versus-shy dimension of temperament can be discerned 
even among squid. This trait is roughly a combination of extraversion 
and stability, and it shows a moderately strong genetic heritability in 
predicting responses to tbreats from predators. Personality traits seem 
to progressively differentiate as brains evolve to be larger and social 
interactions more complex. Samuel Gosling showed that hyenas have 
several personal1ty dimensions that can be reliably rated: assertive~ 
nesS (which is similar to low agreeableness), excitability (similar to low 
stabilitr), human-directed agreeableness (Similar to high agreeable-
ness), sociability (simtlar to high extraversion), and curiosity (similar 
to high openness). Gosling also showed that domesticated dogs show 
analogues of four out of the Big Five traits-energy (extraversion), 
affection (agreeableness), emotional reactivity (low stability), and 
intelligence (opennesslintelligence)-and that humans can rate these 
traits in dogs just as reliably they can in other humans. The Big Five 
also seem applicable to five other species of pets (cats, ferrets, rabbits, 
hedgehogs, horses), and to the other four great ape species (gorillas, 
orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos). Thus, the Big Five are likely to 
have existed for at least 13 million years (back to the last common 
ancestor of aU great apes), and possibly for as long as 125 million years 
(back to the common ancestor of all mammals). Some personality 
dimensions may even date from the divergence between vertebrates 
and invertebrates, around 600 million years ago. 
How Were the Big Five Discovered? 
To most people, general intelligence sounds like a genuinely impor~ 
tant dimension of human variation, whereas the Big Five personality 
traIts sound a bit faddish and arbitrary. How can we have confidence 
that these five traits have any more reality and predictive validit;' than 
other personality constructs that are now consigned to the ever,fuller 
dustbin of psychology's history? Aristotle's student Theophrastus (371-
287 BC) wrote a book on thirty personality types. Galen of Pergamum 

156 
S PEN T 
(AD 130-200) described four personality dimensions correspond-
ing to the four humors (sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic), 
which constituted the dominant European theory of personality 
throughout the Middle Ages and the Enlightenment, persisting even 
into eighteen-century philosophy (lmmanuel Kant) and nineteenth-
century psychology (Wilhelm Wundt). 
Twentieth-century personality psychology developed more sophisti-
cated methods and statistics to characterize human individual differ-
ences, but for many decades, there was no consensus on the number 
or nature of personality dimensions. In the 1940s, Raymond Cattell 
proposed sixteen dimensions of personality, whereas the Myers-Briggs 
system advocated four dimensions. In the 1970s, Hans Eysenck argued 
for three dimensions. Their models have faded. INh)' should we think 
the Big Five will show any more staying power? 
The Big Five theory is distinctive because it emerged gradually, 
over the course of decades, through cumulative empirical research 
and consensus-building literature reviews. The five dimensions are 
not the product of one researcher's pet theory. In 1936 Gordon /Vl-
port and Henry Odbert compiled 4,500 English adjectives describing 
human personality, and later researchers found that meaning similari-
ties among these adjectives could be reduced to about five dimensions. 
These same Big Five dimensions were first empirically identified in 
1954-1961 by two u.s. Air Force researchers (Ernest C. Tupes and 
Raymond E. Christal) by analy-Ling personality data from eight large 
samples of people. Their results were replicated by INarren Norman 
in 1963 in another large sample. In 198] four leading personality 
researchers (Andrew Comre)" John Digman, Lewis Goldberg, and 
Naomi Takemoto-Chock) reached a consensus that the Big FiYe were 
a reliable way to summarize the empirical personality literature. 
Throughout the 1980s, the Big Five model was widely accepted in 
psychology as a viable replacement for previous models. Paul Costa and 
Robert McCrae found the five factors robustly across virtually all the 
personality scales that were being used at the time. They published a 
Five Factor personahty inventory in 1985, and have been refining such 
The Central Six 
157 
measures since then. In the 1990s each of the Big Five proved to be 
highly stable across time within individuals, about 50 percent geneti-
cally heritable across generations, and fairly universal across cultures. 
For example, translated Big Five personality questionnaires still yield 
five factors when administered to Chinese, German, Hebrew, Korean, 
Japanese, and Turkish subjects. Also, across cultures, women always 
show higher average scores than men on agreeableness and conscien-
tiousness, and lower average scores on stability. 
Strictly speaking, I've muddled together a couple of different five-
factor personality theories. Lewis Goldberg's Big Five model includes 
five dimensions called intellect (which I calJ openness), conscientious-
ne.>s, agreeableness, emotional stability (which I call stability), and 
surgency (which I call extraversion). By contrast, Costa and McCrae's 
NEO Five Factor Model includes five similar dimensions called open-
ness. conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism (which I call low 
stability), and extraversion. 
Th~ technical names of the Big Five may sound a bit obscure, but 
they each have hundreds of synonyms that we use in ordinary conver· 
sation. This is the surprising upshot of the 1936 Allport and Odbert 
adjective list: the Big Five personality traits loom so large in human 
life that we have invented vast arrays of words for describing them 
when we gossip about others. Personality psychologists call this the 
lexical hypothesiS: natural-langUBge personality terms already capture 
fairly accurately the true dimensions of human variation. Indeed, if 
there was a major dimension of human behavioral variation that had 
not already been noticed and lexicalized by our linguistiC ancestors, it 
would be surprising indeed. 
Language aside, a person's scores on the Big Five yield a lot of use-
ful information about how to interact with him or her. Lewis Gold-
berg argues that when we meet people, we come armed with a few 
r undamental questions about them: (1) are they interesting (open) or 
boring'; (2) are they reliable (conscientious) orflaky'; (3) are they nice 
(aRfccablc) or nasty?; (4) are they sane (stable) or crazy); (5) are they 
dominnnt (extroverted) or suhmissive? In fact, when I take my border 

158 
SPE NT 
collie, Jenny, to the public dog parks of Albuquerque, these are exactly 
the same questions I ask about any new dog I encounter-especially 
questions 3 and 4, If I meet a pit bull, I know it is likely to be nasty 
and crazy, because pit bulls have been selected across generations for 
dogfighting ferocity, This is why they deserve to be illegal (as they are 
in Australia, Britain, France, New Zealand, and l'vhami, Florida), and 
why the Onion newspaper can raise a chuckle with its mock headline 
"Heroic Pit Bull Journeys 2,000 Miles to Attack Owner" (April 17, 
2002). Whereas, if I meet another border collie, J know it is likely to 
be nice and conscientious, just like its discerning and virtuous owner 
Preferences for the Central Six 
There is a key difference to be noted between intelligence and the 
Big Five. For intelligence, most people prefer friends, mates, and allies 
who are brighter than average rather than dumber than average. Folks 
may not want an IQ,160 genius to occupy every niche in their social 
network, but they do generally wish to have an IQ,120 pal 
than 
an IQ-80 pal, whatever their ovm IQ leveL Within the normal range 
of intelligence, higher is generally better, and is more valued socially 
and sexually. So, G has a strong directionality: everybody wants it, 
and everybody wants to display It. Only when we are trying to take 
advantage of others do we prefer to interact with lower'intelligence 
people-when we con them, seduce them, sell 
things, steal their 
resources, or fight wars 
them. 
However, for the 
personality traits, preferences are mOre 
variable. Generally, people like others whose own personality traits 
are pretty similar to 
own. Those who are high,openness prefer to 
date, marry, befriend, and work with high-openness others, Then they 
can gossip happily about avant'garde science, culture, and aesthetics-
who's won recent Nobel, Booker, Turner, Or MacArthur prizes, Those 
who are low-openness equally prefer low-openness others, so they can 
gOSSip happ;ly about how the pretentious, artsy, metrosexual know'it-
alls are undermining religion, tradition, and civiHl,arion itself. Likewise, 
Th. Central Six

the highly agreeable and gentle like to hang out in churches, nonprofit 
groups, co·ops, and nonviolent peace demonstrations with other highly 
agreeable people; whereas the highly disagreeable and assertive pre-
fer to congregate in war zones, organized crime, and lobbyist confer-
ences. The highly extraverted can be found at parties flirting with one 
another, while the introverted stay home, or sit in libraries a few tables 
away from one another, reading quietly, 
selt'e';te,em usually tracks the trJits that are SOCially v'lllued 
by orhers. High intelligence and high physical attractiveness tend to 
increase self-esteem, whereas the opposite traits lower it, because 
others usually value high intelligence and attractiveness. Likewise, if 
one extreme of a Big Five trait was consistently preferred across most 
situations by most people, then we might expect that people at that 
extreme would develop much higher self'esteem than those at the other 
extreme. The psychologist Richard Robins and his coUeagues did a 
huge online study of 326,641 people, They found that self-esteem cor' 
related positively with openness (r = .17), conscientiousness (r = .24), 
agreE'Albleness (r = .13), stability (r = 50), and extraversion (r = 38). 
Nine previous studies had also found that self,esteem was substan-
tially predicted by emotional stability (happiness, freedom from anxi-
ety, worry. and depression), and modestly by conscientiousness and 
extraversion, but not consistently by openness or agreeableness. These 
ten studies suggest that people usually value higher levels of stability, 
conscientiousness, and extraversion in others, but that preferences for 
openness and agreeableness are not consistent, 
studies have 
shown that people consider higher levels 
stabil-
ity, and agreeableness to be more "normal" 
levels, whereas 
lower levels of openness were considered more "normal." Altogether, 
such studies suggest that there are modest social 
for oth, 
ers to show higher rather than lower levels of conSCIentiousness, agree-
ableness, stability, and extraversion. 
For certain domains of social choice, people do 
directional 
preferences for higher- or lower-than-average levels of particular Big 
I'ive traits, Managers of microchip factories usually want workers who 

160 
S PEN T 
are highly conscientiolls, agreeable, and stable, while managers of cre-
ative advertising teams may prefer workers who are highly open and 
extraverted. Our preferences for Big Five traits can reverse, adaptively 
and sensibly, depending on the circumstances. High jmpulsivit)' and 
spontaneity may be attractive in a short-term lover, but high conscien-
tiollsness may be preferred for a long-term spouse who is respunsible 
for child care and mortgage bills. We may have mixed feelings about 
an acquaintance's Big Five traits, since each level of each trait entails 
both costs and benefits. Highly extraverted friends make it easier to 
make even more friends, but 
also more likely to seduce your 
spouse. Highly agreeable co-workers may be more pleasant to work 
with on most days, but they may be too wimpy to Join a strike for bet-
ter safety conditions. 
Much of human social intelligence seems dedicated to discerning 
which kinds of people, with which Big Five personality traits, would 
be mOst nseful at any given moment, given the partlcular challenges 
we face. Need a couples therapist? Choose someone high on agree-
ableness. Need a bodyguard) Choose the opposite, ;\"eed a tax accoun-
tant? High conscientiousness would work betteL Need a friend for a 
wild bachelor party in Las Vegas? Low conscientiousness would party 
harder. 
Equally, we have incentives to bias how we present ourselves to 
others, depeniling on their needs and circumstances. The couples 
therapist needs to act ferOciously disagreeable if shes in danger of 
being mugged. The tax accountant needs to act like a frolicsome, low-
conscientiousness free spirit if her husband complains that she is lOa 
dull in bed. This is the essence of "impression management," and it is 
a central sodal skill that humans acquire throughout childhood and 
adoiesceJ1ce. We learn to present our apparent Big Five traits in adap-
tively biased ways. Normal adults learn this skill so well that we reca-
librate our trait displays dozens of times a day, to suit our audience, 
goals, and environments. (People who are high on a personality trait 
called self-monitoring are especially prone to monitor and shift their

Big Five traits are stable across each individual's life span not because 
they predict behavior invariabli' across all situations, but because they 
predict behavior on average if you get to know somebody across many 
different situations. 
The most dramatic shifts in apparent personality are called emo-
tions If we suddenlv need to appear mnch lower in agreeableness, 
give~ some socjal threat, we enter a special new mode of percep-
tual, cognitive, and behavioral operation called anger. Anger gives us 
a credible but temporary boost in assertiveness, aggressiveness, and 
formidability. If we suddenly need to appear much higher in open-
ness in order to attract a particular mate, we enter a special mode of 
operation called being in love. This emotional state yields a huge but 
temporary boost in energy, novelty seeking, and interest in culture, 
poetry, music, the arts, the emotional nuances of human interaction, 
and the existential mysteries of the cosmos. Once the courtship dis-
play accomplishes its mission (which might range from copulation to 
marriage), the being-in-Iove dissipates, and we return to Our normal, 
usually much lower level of openness. Less dramatic shifts in apparent 
perso~ality are called moods-they last longer than emotions, but are 
less extreme in intensity. An irritable mood reduces one's agreeable-
ness' a whimsical mood reduces one's conscientiousness. 
S'o, there is continuum of duration from emotions and moods 
as short-term stales to Big Five personality dimensions as long-rerm 
traits. From the perspective of emotions research, personality traits 
are si mply stable propensities to feel certain emotional states more 
oftcn, But from the perspective of personality 
emotions are 
simply transient shifts in one's manifest personality tralts. 
This duration difference between emotiont.1 states and personality 
traits has obvious implications for the ways we evaluate others, If we 
are seeking a one-shot, shorr-term interaction with someone, we pay 
more attention to the person's current emotional state. If we just want 
to buy a few groceries in a store that we will never enter again, we may 
choose the cashier who seems happier (apparently more agreeable) at 
the moment, without bothering to judge whether that agreeableness 

162 
S PENT 
level will be stable across time. But if we are seeking a long-term rela-
tionsbip with someone, we pay mOTe attention to his Or her stable per-
sonality traits. If we frequent the local organic food co-op, we may 
come to favor the cashier who is consistently agreeable, even if 
has 
some bad days. Since the most important relationships in life tend to 
be such longer-tenn, repeated interactions, we care more about judg-
ing people's stable personalities in those contexts. 
Measuring Your Big Five 
The Big Five can now be measured with moderate accuracy, using 
a self-rating scale, in about one minute. The psychologists Beatrice 
Rammstein and Oliver John published a Big Five scale in 2007 called 
the BF1·1O that uses just ten questions, They found that people's scores 
on this very short scale were very reliable across a two-month period 
(with test·retest correlations about .84), and correlated very highly 
(about ,82) with their scores on much longer personality scales, 
Their BFI-lO scale is reprinted below in a slightly clearer form; try 
it and see how you score. 
After each statement below, wlite down a number from I to 5 to 
represent how well the statement describes your personality, where 
j 
disagree strongly, 
2 
disagree a little, 
3 = neither agree nor disagree, 
4 = agree a little, 
5 = agree strongly, 
1 See Myself as Someone Who 
L has an active imagination, 
2. has few artistic interests. 
3. 
a thorough job. 
4, tends to be lazy, 
The Central Six 
5. is generally trusting. 
6. tends to find fault with others. 
7. is relaxed, handles stress well. 
8. gets nervous easily. 
9, is outgoing, sociable, 
!O is reserved. 
163 
Here's how to score yourself. Items 1 and 2 concern openness; 3 
and 4 concern conscienliousness) 5 and 6 concern agreeableneSSI 7 
and 8 concern emotional stability, and 9 and 10 concern extraversion, 
For each successive pair of items, subtract the number YOll wrote for 
the even-numbered item from the number you wrote for the odd-
munbered item, and that gives your score for the corresponding Big 
Five trait. Scores can range from -4 (very low on the trait) to +4 (very 
high on the trait), with 0 being about average, 
For example, if you "agree a little" with "[ see myself as someone 
who has an active imagination," you should have written a 4 for item 
1. If )'OU "disagree strongly" with ") see myself as someone who has 
few artistic interests," YOIl should have written a 1 for item 2, Then 
you'd subtract your response to the even-numbered item (I) from your 
response to the odd-numbered item (4), yielding a score of 3-which 
would mean you are quite high on openness, given that the average is 
o and the maximum is 4. 
The Central Six Eaeh Form a Bell Curve 
Everybody knows that the disttibution of human intelligence forms a 
bell curve, or a roughly normal distribution, Most people duster in the 
middle, near IQ 100 The distribution tapers off quickly as IQ scores 
deviate from the average, so that fools and geniuses are both rare, 
When most of us seek mates, friends, or co-workers, we are not much 
bothered about the extremes, but do the best we can to distinguish 
among others ncar the middle of the range, We generally 
associ-
ates with IQs of 11 'i rmher than 9S r,ecausc that stacks the odds in our 

164 
S PEN T 
favor: they are a bit more likely to help uS solve existing problems, and 
a bit less likely to create new Ones" 
Less well-known is the fact that all the Big Five personality traits 
have a similar bell-curve distribution" Most people are moderately 
agreeabJe--capabJe of wannhearted kindness under some circum-
stances, capable of wicked selfishness under others, but generally just 
muddling along in the seminiee, semiselfish state we recognize as the 
human condition, Relentless good and relentless evil are equally rare" 
This bell-curviness of each of the Central Six dimensions is a gen-
uine empirical discovery While it is true that almost all continuously 
varying biological traits form a bell curve, many of these traits are not 
continuously varying; they are discrete" They involve distinctive pat-
terns of gene activation that give rise to qualitatively different things: 
neurons versus muscle cells versus bone cells, Brains versus hearts ver-
sus femurs, Males versus females, Se.xually immature juveniles versuS 
sexually mature adults, Caterpillars versus butterflies" Fertile versus 
pregnant females, It is fairly COmmon for 
to have distinctive 
"morphs" of this sort: different forms or states of 
orgamsm special-
ized for different social, sexual, or ecological roles, 
themselves 
are, of course, different morphs On a grander seale, kept qualitatively 
distinct by reproductive isolation, 
So, it eould have been the case that human personalities fell into 
discrete 
like Jungian archetypes: the child, the eternal boy, 
the hero, the great mother, the wise old man, the trieksleL However, 
most of these are just typical human life stages tather than distinctive 
personality types: child = child, eternal boy 
narcissistic adolescent; 
hero 
single young male pursuing reprodu~tive success through high-
risk status seeking; great mother = mature female; wise old man = 
mature male, The trickster is a true personality exemplar, but he basi-
cally just shows low conscientiousness by breaking rules and violating' 
social norms, plus higher than average intelligence and openness, and 
lower than average agreeableness, (Note that the marketer stereotype 
closely follows the trickster archetype") With regard to all the other 
interesting personality traits, there aren't salienlJungian archetypes or 
The Cenfral Six 
165 
discrete personality categories-just the continuous normal distribu-
tion of each traiL 
This simple 
has profound implications for marketing, as it 
means that most distinct personality types used in market segmen-
tation are illusory, The outdated Myers-Briggs dichotomies (feeling 
versus thinking; judging versus perceiving) just can't work if the under-
lying traits are normally distributed, Also, if many of the demographic 
(age, sex, ethnicjty) differences in consumer behavior boil down to 
these different groups' having somewhat different 
scores on 
the Central Six dimensions, [hen these demographic categories will 
also be deeply misleadjng in characterizing consumers, For example, 
if men respond more positively to an aggressive-looking product design 
than women do, it may be tempting for market researchers to attribute 
the difference to sex per se. However, males and females have differ-
ent avemge 
agreeableness, which probably influence reactions 
to aggressive-looking products, The sex difference in agreeableness, 
and not sex itself, may be the factor driving the consumer responses, 
It is important to know which is the ease, because agreeableness is 
continuous, whereas se.x is dichotomous, The distribution of male 
agreeableness overlaps substantially with 
distribution of female 
agreeableness, so measuring consumer agreeableness levels may be 
much more predictive of their reactions than asking about their sex" 
same concern applies to all other criteria for market segmentll-
tion, Nation, region, language, culture, socioeconomic slatus, class, 
and education level may predict consumer behavior mainly because 
they are correlated with some of the Central Six traits, not because 
they directly cause the behavior, If so, it will almost always be more 
effective to measure the Central Six directly rather than relying on 
traditional market segmentlltion 
to predict behavior 
The Central Six Are Fairly Independent 
Surprisingly, the Central Six traits are not much correlated with one 
,mother. In fact, they arc almost statistically indepcndenL knowin!; 

166 
S PE N T 
a person's score on one trait gives you almost no information about 
thel[ other traits. This explains why people are motivated to display 
all six traits in different ways, through different behaviors and product 
purchases. 
The only major exception is that genetal intelligence has a modest 
positive correlation v:ith openness: hright people tend to be mOre inter-
ested than average in new experiences, travel, culture, and aesthetics. 
Com-ersely, people who are culturally engaged and open-minded tend 
to be brighter than average. For this r"",son, university towns tend to 
have better cultural institutJons. Yet even 
the small size of the 
posltive correlation means that there are plenty of bright but conven< 
tional people, who may work as engineers for the military-industrial 
complex, listen to the same classic rock they did thirty years ago, and 
know forty gigabytes of baseball statistics. Likewise, 
are plenty 
of open<minded novelty seekers who love strange ideas and experi-
ences, but who are not very bright. They constitute the market for 
fantasy novels, self-help books, nutracellticals, facial piercings, music 
by Enya, degrees in nonevolutionary psychology, and every product 
labeled "homeopathic." Indeed, their combination of neophili" and 
inanity make them an extremely profitable market segment. 
The fact that the Central Six are fairly independent of one another 
violates many of our social stereotypes. You might know some gradu< 
ate students and conclude that high intelligence and high neuroticism 
(low stability) go hand in hand. Yet they don't, on average, across the 
whole population: lower-intelligence people get just as anxious and 
depressed. You might know some Greenpeace liberals and assume 
that h1gh openness and high agreeableness go together. Yet they don't: 
some people 
extreme new experiences in sadomasochistic unsafe 
sex) criminal gangSI political terrorisnl, or careers in cos.metics mar~ 
keting (think of Tyler Durden in Fight Club). For every pair of social 
stereotypes that seem to confirm a positive correlation between two of 
the Central Six, there exists an opposite pair of stereotypes that seem 
to confirm a negative correlation. 
The Centrol Six 
167 
Our stereotyped dichotomies are so numerous 
nuanced rhat 
almost any combination of personaht y traits can seem to fit some type, 
yet those types are illusory. As we have seen, in the space of human 
personality traits, we really have what statisticians call a multivariate 
normal distribution: each dimension is a bell curve with most people 
near the average, and each dimension is independent of the others. 
Given our six independent dimensions, if we split each into Just three 
levels (low, average, or high), then we'd have three to the sixth power 
possible combinations, or 729 different personality types-rather 
larger than the number of types typically posited in astrology, Jungian 
psychoanalysis, or most market segmentation. 
Beyond the Central Six? 
Clearly, the Central Six do not cover all the individual differences that 
characterize human nature, for we must also take into account virtues 
and vices, values and interests, political and religiOUS attitudes, hob< 
and skills, mental illnesses and addictions. Yet even many of these 
can be predicted fairly strongly by the Central Six. They correlate, 
often to a surprisingly high degree. 
For example, many of the new<fangled types of intelligence that 
have become popular recently (social intelligence, emotional intel-
ligence, creative intelligence) boil down to general intelligence plus 
some combination of the Big Five personality traits. Social intelli-
gence as studied by developmental psychologists and primatologists 
means the capacities for perspective taking and social strategizing, 
but it seems rather well predicted by a combination of general intel-
ligence and extraversion, plus agreeableness (when empathy pays) or 
disagreeableness (when exploitation pays). People with autism have 
only somewhat reduced average intelligence, but they typiC:,1Ily have 
severely reduced extraversion and agreeableness. Similarly, emotional 
intelligence means the capacities for perceiving emotions expressed 
by others, using emotions to gUlde one·s own thinking and problem 

168 
S PE N T 
solving, understanding the nature and sodal functions of emotions, 
and managing one's own emotions adaptively, Yet the capacities for 
perceiving and understanding emotions correlate strongly with gen-
eral intelligence, and emotional self-management correlates strongly 
with conscientiousness and stability, Finally, creativity research sug-
gests that short-term creative intelligence is basically general intel-
ligence plus openness, while long-term creative achievement is also 
predicted by consciemiousness (hard work 
ambition) and extra-
version (active surgency and social networking), In our recent book 
Nfating Intelligence, Glenn Geher and [posited a dimension of "mating 
intelligence" concerned with sexual courtship and relationships-but 
unlike the advocates of social, emotional, or multiple intelligences, we 
explicitly argued that it is likely to correlate rather strongly with gen-
eral intelligence and some of the Big Five, 
Sexual traits are also well predicted by 
Central Six, The per-
sonality trait of "sociosexuality," as developed by 
Gangestad 
and Jeffry Simpson, indexes sexual promiscuity, 
with "unre-
stricted" sociosexuality (the highly promiscuous) have 
numbers 
of sexual partners, more one-night stands, and higher infidelity rates, 
They also tend to have high extraversion, People who are very extreme 
on these trails tend to join the Lifestyle--the polyamorous commu-
nity of hooking up, swinging, and open marriages exemplified by the 
International Lifestyle Association, The highly sociosexual, open, 
impulsive, and selfish tend to invest mOre of their time and energy in 
"mating effort" rather than "parenting effort": they arC constantly seek-
ing new sexual partners rather than raising the offspring from existing 
relationships, On the other hand, people with "restricted" sociosexual-
ity (the virginal, the chaste, and the happily married} have fewer sex-
ual partners, less inlldelity, lower openness, higher conscientiousness, 
higher agreeableness, and lower extraversion, They invest mOre time 
and energy in parenting effort and Jess in mating effort The highly 
sociosexual consider the less sociosexual to be repressed and sancti-
monious, and dismiss them as prigs, prudes, puritans, and hypocrjtes, 
The Centrol Six 
169 
The less sociosexual denounce the more sociosexual as sluts, tarts, 
whores, rakes, and dogs, (Clearly, there are different opinions about 
the optimal level of SOciosexuality that one's mates, friends, and neigh-
bors should display,) 
The Central Six also predict social, political, and religious atti-
tudes fairly well. Liberals are only a little brighter than conservatives 
on average, but they tend to show significantly higher openness (more 
interest in novelty and diversity), lower conscientiousness (less adher-
ence to conventional social norms), and higher agreeableness (more 
widespread empathy and "bleeding hearts"), Conservatives show lower 
openness (more traditionalism and xenophobia), higher conscientious-
ness (family-values moralism, sense of duty, civic-mindedness), and 
lower agreeableness (more hard-headed, hard-hearted support for their 
self-interests and national interests), However, since the !Iaditional 
left-right political spectrum has only one dimension, and the Central 
Six has six dimenSions, it is morc accurate to describe the complete 
range of human political attltudes using 
Central 
For example, 
the 1960s New Left was basically more 
(freethinking) than the 
.19305 Old Left. Fascists can be seen as basically lower-intelligence 
conservatives with lower stability (more 
distress, anxiety, and 
neuroticism) and even lower agreeableness (more aggressive interests 
in warfare, torture, and genocide), Libertarians can be viewed as basi-
cally higher-intelligence liberals with slightly higher conscientiousness 
(faith in social reciprocity and the work ethic), lower agreeableness 
(distaste for conspicuous sympathy displays), and an extra dollop of 
extraversion (self-reliant surgency), 
Although the Central Six are fairly solid empirical discoveries, 
research on individual differences continues, and might hold some sur-
General intelligence is w1likely to be dethroned as the queen of 
predictive power in the land of psychodiversity, but the Big 
be replaced with an even better model of personality variation at some 
future point. This will depend on new discoveries in genetics (do the 
Big Five depend on distinct sets of genes?), neuroscience (do the Big 

170 
S PE NT 
Five depend on distinct brain systems?), and evolutionary psychology 
(do the Big Five serve distinct adaptive functions?), We need a much 
dearer idea of why evolution shou Id have maintained heritable "aria' 
tion in five main personality traits, rather than three, or eight, Or fifty, 
The answer must have something to do "'ith the number of ways that 
human social strategies could vary adaptively "ithin prehistoric dans, 
Several researchers are working hard on this issue in the new field of 
evolutionary personality psychology, But for the moment, the Big Five 
is the best model we have, and we might as well see how far we can go 
with it 
10 
Traits That Consumers Flaunt 
and Marketers Ignore 
IF WE WEllE all honest about these Central Six traits, then dating, 
socializing, and working would be much simpleL \\le could just have 
six numbers tattooed on our foreheads, representing our percentile 
scores on each of the traits, Speed dating could be even faster, as we 
could instantly reject potential mates who score too low or too high on 
the traits we care most about, Presidential debates could just be ono' 
mmute close' ups of each candidate's trait percentiles, and we could 
immediately see which candidate is too stupid (or 100 smart?), or too 
high or Iowan each of the Big Five, for us to vote for him or her 
Unfortunately, sllch trait-score tattoos would be unreliable, as 
people would be naturaIl), inclined to fake them. Consider the limeli-
abiliry of humper stickers as trait displays. Because our mental tmits 
arc hard to assess when we're wrapped in sheet metal and tinted glass, 
as we saw earlier, drivers often decorate their cars with $4 tr'Jit dis-
plays called bumper stickers, in an attempt to reveal the driver's soul 
on a three-by,ten'inct. plastic-laminate strip, However, there is no 
way to guarantee that bumper stickers accurately reflect the driver's 
true mental traits, Convenience-store clerks will seU you these things 
without even checking your scores on the one,minute BFI-1O per-
sonality inventory, You might have even shoplifted one of the high-
conscientiousness or high-agreeableness examples. Economists have 
a special technical term for a signal that is so unreliable--they call it 
"cheap talk" Bumper stickers are promises ""th no credibility, claims 
with no evidence, They may be amusing, but you would not choose a 
friend or lover solely on that basis, 
So, instead 
Just displaying cheap-talk trait tattoos and bumper 
Slickers, we huy and display costly products that we think will testify 

172 
S PEN T 
mOre reliably to our key traits. Many people spend tens of thousands of 
dollars and four years of hard study getting a prestigious university degree, 
which contains no more trait information than a two-hour IQ test. \Ve 
pay huge interest on credit-card debt just to build up a good credit score, 
to credibly display our conscientiousne_<,> for the time when we need 
a mortgage, We spend profligately on mobile phones so we can gossip 
loudly in public to our friends and appear credibly extraverted, Some of 
us subscribe to Harper's, Wired, or Prospect to display cosmopolitan cul-
tural sophistication, also known as openness, Billions of others PldY daily, 
attend church weekiy, and support the eostly priest caste to display their 
moral \rirtues--{:onscientiousness, agreeableness, conservatism. 
\.\!hat these products have in common is not just their up-front 
capital cost, but the difficulty of exploiting them properly if one lacks 
the right personality traits, Even jf you do manage to rake your way 
illto Cambridge Universil y, you won't be able to fake your ess~ys, tut;-
rials, class participation, and grades, Even if your income qualifies you 
for an American Express Platinum Card, your credit rating will drop if 
you don't pay YOllr bills conscientiously Even if you subscribe to Pros-
pect (Britain's best intellectual magazine), YOll won't be able to con, 
verse intelligently about its content if )'OU are not open to new ideas, If 
you are an irritable, short-tempered psychopath, you will not be able 
to stand weekly church sermons and rituals that will test your limited 
patience and agreeableness to the breaking point. 
Thus, some of the most socially important products cannot be 
bought and displayed witb money alone, because we "''lint to know a 
lot more about people than their wealth, Many of these products don't 
even look like products in the traditional retail sense, A Cambridge 
degree, a good credit rating, a local reputation as a well-informed 
intellectual or a generous churchgoer-none of these can be bought 
in a shopping mall, although money is required for each. In the next 
four chapters, we'll look at the four traits out of the Central Six that I 
consider most important for understanding consumer behavior; intel· 
ligence, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Stability and 
Traits That Consumers Flaunt and Marketers Ignore

extraversion are also fascinating, but it would be tedious to analyze all 
the Central Six in equal detaiL By the time you understand the nrst 
four in the coming chapters, you'll probably get the idea. 
How Car Choices Reveal the Central Six Traits 
One of the most expensive ways that cOnsumers try to display tbeir 
Centra I Six traits is through their choice of car brands and features. 
At least at a semiconscious level, car buyers seek a match between 
their own personality traits and the apparent "brand personality" pro' 
mated in the carmaker's advertising, The)' also tend to seek the fea, 
tures that seem most important given their aspirations and anxieties 
as shaped by their Central Six traits. The table below lists some car 
brands and features that seem associated with high and low levels of 
each of the Central Six. (These are just my own impressions and ste, 
reotypes; each entry is debatable and subject to many exceptions. As

Despite the lack of quantitative evidence, sOme brands clearly strive 
to become assoelated with a certain Central Six traiL For example, 
Subaru sponsors the anoual meeting of the American Academy for 
the Advancement of SCience, so it pretty dearly seeks patronage [rom 
high" meJJigence consumers. 
Some of the brands seem a,sociated with extremes of several 
t raits-BMW, for example, seems to connote high intelligence, low 
agreeableness, high stability, and high extraversion. [f only one'third 
of people arc at these extremes for each of these four traits, and if 
I he four traits are uncorrelated, then BMW is tacitly restricting its 
mnrket segment to one-third to the fourth power, or one out of every 
<,jghty-one potential car buyers. Thus, a strong brand personality can 

)76 
S PENT 
allow the consumer to display a more distinctive trait signal, but it 
might limit a company's market share. By contrast, if Oldsmobile is 
associated mainly with one trait's extreme (being older than average, 
hence lower in openness), then it is restricted to only one out of three 
potential car-buyers. 
Advertising the Central Six Through 
Music Preferences and \Veh Pages 
In a few exceptional cases, product choices can function similarly to 
cheap-talk trait tattoos and bumper stickers. Music preferences, for 
example, seem to work as fairly reliable indicators of the Central Six 
traits. In some fascinating recent studies, pE'Isonality psychologists 
Peter Rentfrow and Samuel Gosllng have investigated how people's 
Big Five traits arc conveyed commonly, quickly, easily, and accurately 
by their stated music preferences. Previous research had already 
shown that personality traits and music preferences are genuinely 
correlated, and that people display their music preferences (in can· 
versation, on personal websites, or on iPod playlists) to display their 
personality traits. Rentfrow and Gosling went further in analYZing the 
rich personality information conveyed by musical tastes. J n one study, 
sixty college students were asked to get to know one another during a 
six-week period through an online ehat system, and the researchers 
recorded the topics of their conversations. They found that music was 
by far the most common chat topic--more popular than discussing 
111O\'ies, books, TV shows, clothing, or sports. 
In another Rentfrow and Gosling study, seventy-four college stu-
dents eompleted a Big FIVe personality questionnaire and then listed 
their top-ten favorite songs. For each student, those songs were then 
recorded onto a GD that was heard by eight listeners, who judged each 
of that student's Big 
traits. Correlations between listener judg-
ments and student self-reports were significant for four of the Big Five 
traits: openness (+.47), extraversion (+.27), emotional stability (+.23), 
Traits That Consumers flaunt and Marketers Ignore 
)77 
and agreeableness (+.21). (These correlations sound low, but they are 
impressive given that the listeners had no other information about the 
students they were judging: no photos or video, or informatiun about 
age, sex, or mce.) This accuracy was mediated by both the music 
genres pteferred (emotionally stable students liked country music, at 
least if they were from Texas) and the specific acoustic features of 
the songs (extraverts liked music rated as containing a lot of energy, 
enthusiasm, and singing). Moreover, the personality information con-
veyed by music preferences mcely complemented that which can be 
discerned from photos or short video recordings of people (which are 
better at revealing conscientiousness and extraversion). 
ft also seems likely that music preferences reveal general intel-
ligence. Conventional Top 40 radio stations, pop music, and easy-
listening musie are designed to maximize sales by appealing to the 
center of the bell curve. Alternative music and classical mUSIC basi-

Why Marketers Ignore the Central Six 
Surprisingly, most marketers have no idea how well the Central Six 
can predict consumer behavior. The typical consumer beha,ior text-
book includes a large section devoted to individual differences, but 
no discussion of general intelligence and the Big Five traits, Rather, 
the focus is on diverse "factors" that may influence consumer deci-
sion making: wealth, time, knowledge, attitudes, values, self-concepts, 
and motivations, The fact that the Central 
efficiently predict indio 
vidual variation across all these factors remains un known or ignored, 
General intelligence sometimes makes an appearance under the guise 
of "COgnitive resources," but this term is usually construed to mean

individual differences in the ability to focus attention given current 
distractions, The fact that intelligence predicts wealth and knowl· 
edge is ignored, as is the fact that the Big Five traits predict attitudes, 
values, self·concepts, and motivations. Marketers likewise pay atten-
tion to "demographic variables"-age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
status-without taking into account their correlations with the Cen-
tral Six. 
A similar ignorance of the Central Six afflicts academic consumer-
behavior research, The three leading journals-Journal of Marketing 
(Jlv!), Journal of Marketing Research (JMR), and Journal of Consumer 
Research (JCR)-have published Sixty-four hundred papers in total, of 
which only about sixty papers refer to personality at all, and only three 
of which refer to five,factor models of personality or to any of the spe-
cific Big Five traits. IndjV]dual differences in consumer intelligence 
get even less attention. Not a Single JM, JMR, or JCR paper has ever 
mentioned general intelligence, the g factor, Or IQ (one JCB paper in 
1984 did mention "cognitive ability," but rejected the idea of a general 
intelligence factor), References to traits, genetics, and heritability are 
equally rare, A handful of papers in these journals uSe costly signaling 
theory in discussing how companies can send signals about product 
quality to consumers, but none discuss how consumers can send sig-
nals about their own traits to other people. Further, JM, jMR, and 
JCR papers almost never mention conspicuolls consumption, Veblen, 
social status, or positional goods (discussed below), 
In a 2002 review paper, marketing professor Hans Baumgartner 
observed that: 
Personality research has long been a fringe player in the study of 
consumer behavior. Little research is directly devoted to personality 
issues, and if consumer personality is investigated at all, it tends to 
be from the narrow perspective of developing yet another individual 
difference measure in an already crowded field of personality scales 
or considering the moderating effects of a given trait on some rela-
tionship of interest.

Basically, consumer research just isn't keeping up to date with discov-
eries in personality psychology or recognizing how powerfully the Big 
Five traits influence consumer behavior and self-display. 
l'vlany consumer research papers assume that consumers simply 
prefer products that match their own "identities" or "self-schemata," 
such that the "brand personality" is congruent with their "consumer 
personality." The consumer's desire for a product to fit with his per-
sonal identity is usually construed as a matter of "relationship quality" 
(the consumer relates to the brand as if it were a person in its own 
right) rather than a matter of strategic trait signaling (the consumer 
chooses the brand to reveal information about his own traits to other 
real people). By this account, highly agreeable consumers prefer highly 
agreeable products (those that appear gentle and kind) as a silly side 
effect of their social preferences for highly agreeable friends-not as a 
sensible, reliable way to display their agreeableness to others. 
Some consumer researchers have recognized that conSumers strive 
to "communicate desired identities" to others through their product 
choices, especially when the "identity salience" (trait-signaling power) 
of products is high. This insight is central to "conswner culture the-
ory," which emphasizes the social, cultural, symbolic, aesthetic, and 
ritualistic ways that consumers create and display their personal and 
collective identities through their product choices. Consumer culture 
theory usually entails qualitative observational research on consumer 
identities within particular markets, subcultures, and ideologies. How-
ever, this theory has some serious shortcomings from a scientific point 
of view: it is vague about the nature of individual consumer "identity" 
(the specific traits being displayed), murky about the actual function 
of displaying collective "identity" (class, age, sex, ethnicity), and hos-
tile to evolutionary insights into human nature and social interaction. 
Also, consumer culture theory has not succeeded in finding common 
ground with the other main paradigms in conswner research: rational 
choice theory, cognitive psychology, experimental deSign, and quanti-
tative analysis. 
Part of the problem here is the artificial distinction between "utili-
Traits That Consumers Ffaunt and Marketers Ignore 
181 
tarian" goods (allegedly valued just for their practical utiliry, such as an 
axe), "hedonic" goods (valued just for their subjective pleasure, such as 
ice cream), and "positional" goods (valued just for their status-signaling 
power, such as diamond earrings). This distinction is treacherous, 
because, as we saw earlier, aj] branded products that are profitable 
to sell must include some elements of conspicuous waste, precision, 
and/or reputation. These elements inform the conswner's knowledge 
that the product makes a good trait display, and become confounded 
with the consumer's experience of pleasure in buying, using, and dis-
playing the product. 1\lso, the ostensible utility of a product is often 
conllated with its conspicuous preCision and reputation. The concept 
of a positional good is fairly applicable to products as intelligence sig-
nals (since most people want to appear positioned higher rather than 
lower on the bell curve of IQ), but it applies less comfortably to prod, 
ucts as signals of Big Five traits (where there is less consensus about 
which nait level is optimal). 
So, most current research on marketing and conSumer behavior 
relies on a chaotic grdb bag of outdated theories and unreliable find-
ings. The potent effects of general intelligence are hidden behind its 
causal effects, empirical correlates, and politically correct euphemisms: 
education, class, socioeCOnomic status, consumer knowledge, "cognitive 
resources," and "cultural capitaL" Often, marketers think they are study-
ing the effects of class, race, or religion on consumer decision making 
when they are actually studying the effecls of intelligence, which shows 
different average scores, for whatever reasons, across different classes, 
races, and religions. The potent effects of the Big Five are likewise hid-
den behind their correlates and euphemisms: attitudes, motivations, 
self-concept, values, lifestyle, culture. Here, marketers think they are 
studying the effects of sex, age, or pohtical beliefs, when they are actu-
ally studying the effects of openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, 
stabiliry, or extraversion, which also show different average scores across 
males and females, young and old, liberals and conservatives. 
Such imprecise ways of trying to understand individual differ-
('nccs in consumer behavior are popular among marketing professors 

182 
S PEN T 
and consultants for two key reasons. First, acknowledging the Cen-
tral Six would be politically incorrect, socially awkward, and down-
right embarrassing for marketers, who mostly think of themselves as 
the most liberal, progressive, creative people in the corporate world. 
Marketers are nevertheless surprisingly comfortable with stereotyping 
people by demographic group (age, sex, ethnicity, class, nationality), 
despite their political correctness. For instance, one recent consumer-
behavior textbook claimed that "Germans are very ambitious, success 
oriented, and competitive"; "the rrench seek novelty and elegance"; 
"Chinese tend to be ethnocentric"; "in Mexico, deadlines are flexible"; 
"compared with Protestants and Catholics, Jews are more liberal and 
democratic, more flexible and rationalistic, higher in achievement 
motivation, more enthusiastic, gregarious, and emotional, more impa-
tient and hurried, more inclined to postpone gratification, and polit-
ically most liberaL" IVlarketing is perhaps the last academic field in 
which blatant stereotyping by nation, religion, class, and sex is coun-
tenanced, as marketers can always claim that such groups just happen 
to have learned different values, nom1S, and cultures. 
It would be much more awkward, socially and ideologically, for 
marketers to argue that demographic groups have different consumer 
preferences and behaviors because they hav-e djfferent distributions of 
psychological traits. Imagine if differences between Asian American 
and Anglo American consumer beha,ior could be explained entirely 
by the slightly higher average IQ of Asian Americans. Imagine if "gen_ 
der role rufferences" in consumer behavior boiled down to sex ruffer-
cnces in agreeableness. Imagine if some "cross-cultural differences" in 
consumer behavior boiled down to subtle cross-national differences 
in average openness or conscientiousness. If marketers simultaneously 
measured the Central Six traits and their usual demographiclcultural 
variables, and consistently found differences in trait averages and vari-
ances as a function of age, sex, race, class, religion, or nationality, it 
would be a public relations disaster. Such fmdings would violate the 
central intellectual taboo of modern American life-thBt one mustn't 
talk about meaningful psychological differences between groups. If, 
Traits That Consumers Flaunt and Marketers Ignore 
183 
even worse, they found that the Central Six predicted consumer behav-
ior better than the usual demographic/cultural variables, it would cast 
doubt on the standard liberal blank-slate view that demography is 
destiny-that socialized identity as part of a collective group predicts 
human behavior better than individual heritable traits. 
Also, group stereotyping (a.k .•. market segmentation) would be-
come more challenging if marketers acknowledged the Central Six. 
Different groups' and cultures' consumption propensities would have to 
be represented as partly overlapping clusters in a six-dimensional space 
of continuously variable traits. Instead of making superficial general .. 
izations, marketers would have to measure personality profiles across 
groups by using empirically reliable, valid instruments applied to rep-
resentative population samples. This would admittedly be more expen-
sive than gathering basic demographic data (age, sex, race, class)-but 
it would be much cheaper in the long run than misconceived product 
design and misguided marketing strategy. 
Second, marketing would be a much simpler, more stable, more 
progressive field of human knowledge if it were based on simple, sta-
ble, progressive models of humans derived from up-to-date psychology 
research. But that would be a bad thing for business-school academ-
ics seeking tenure through highly citable innovations in consumer 
research, and for marketing consultants seeking clients for faddish new 
consumer personality tests and market segmentation techniques. Tying 
them down too closely to the massive empirical research and solid the-
ory in intelligence research and personality research would leave little 
wiggle room for radical new books, videos, and training seminars. 
As the science historian Thomas Kuhn pointed out, once a sci-
ence finds a winning formula 
a way of making predictable, cumula-
tive progress-it achieves the status of a "paradigm." VVhen pararugms 
are chugging along happily, and normal science is being done, radical 
"paradigm shifts" become less likely to succeed_ This is as it should 
be: the more we know about some domain, the less likely it is that a 
random new idea about the domain will be correct. The more complex 
thc organism, the less likely it is that il mndom mutation will improve 

184 
SPEN T 
its fitness, The more complex the society, the less likely it is that a 
major political revolution will improve everyone's welfare, 
However, consumer researchers often profit from touting their 
latest hypotheses as radical paradigm shifts that can offer their con-
sultingclients big advantages over rivals, In order to keep the merry-go-
round of continual paradigm shifts dizzying the clients and spinnmg 
the money, any upstart theory that looks likely to yield a genuine, sta-
ble, unifying paradigm must be killed in its cradle, for the collective 
good of the consulting profession, This is the economic rationale for 
why marketing abhors well-established psychological constructs, More 
sCientifically minded market researchers would no doubt welcome the 
opportunity to understand consumer preferences more deeply using 
the Central Six, perhaps combined with demographic information, 
However, because the concepts of general intelligence and the Big Five 
personality traits are already in the public domain, they can't easily be 
turned into a patented new business model or other form of intellec-
tual property, so they can't lead to a start-up company that grows fad· 
dish and gets bought out, 
There is also an intellectual reason for marketers to overlook the 
Central Six: well-established scientific theories get boring after a while. 
Indeed, this is a danger of atlending too many meetings of the Interna-
tional SOciety for Intelligence Research: one hears talk after talk about 
how good old-fashioned measures of good old-fashioned general intel-
ligence predict yet another aspect of human behavior better than any 
other construe!' The same hDlds true at personality psychology confer-
ences: most talks now identify how the Big Five, 
again, capture 
most of the human variation in behavior-including the variation that 
some exciting new measure claims to tap for the first time, Again and 
again, the Central Six show their reliability and validity in individual 
differences research-a situation that leaves serious psycholOgists a 
little bored, but mostly happy, because we know that we really are 
making cumulative scientific progress, On the other hand, the stable, 
ubiquitous power of the Central Six would drive most marketers nuts

used last year They want something new and secret: the radical new 
way to chop the population into chunks that can be optimally targeted 
by new product lines and advertising campaigns, The Central Six offer 
no hope of that, because: they are each continuous normal distribu-
tions; they have been well understood by psychologists for twenty 
years; they can be measured "-lth great reliability and validity by exist-
ing questionnaires; and they are common knowledge, They offer no 
excitement, only accuracy; no tTendiness, only solidity, 
In particular, marketers like to measure individual differences in 
very domain-specific ways that require arcane knowledge, They mea-
sure "mdividualism versus collectivism" and "abstract versus associa-
tive thinking style" to characterize cross-national differences, They 
measure "masculinity versus femininity" and "gender-role conformity" 
to characterize sex differences, They measure "strength of reference 
group influence" to characterize age differences, They measure internal 
versus external "locus of conrror to characterize religious differences, 
These domain-specific dimensions make life deliciously complex, 
How dull it would be if we realized that "collectivism" and "strength 
of reference group" are basically conscientiollsness, "abstract thinking 
style" is general intelligence, "internal locus of control" is quite similar 
to the surgency facet of extraversion. and "masculmity" often means 
little more than low agreeableness, low conscientiousness, and high 
stability, 
You might think that individual marketers would want to build 
solid, accurate models of consumer preferences so that their firms 
could maximize sales and profits. but you'd be wrong, The social, 
sexual, and career incentives for individual marketers to be eXCiting, 
trendy, and cool are often poorly aligned with the financial interests 
of a firm's shareholders, In fact, a leading economic theory of advertis-
ing suggests that the content of marketing and advertising is largely 
irrdevanL Rather, the costs that a corporation incurs through market-

to potential employees, investors, and rival corporations, rather than 
ways actually to attract customers. This theory of advertising as con· 
spicuous mrporate waste follows the same costly Signaling logic we 
have encountered so often before. Insofar as it's true, the real function 
of marketers is not to understand and influence customers, but to earn 
high salaries, make a lot of nOise, and stay away from the assembly 
line.

GenerallnteUigence 
HUMAl'I INTELLtGE:<CE H,'S two aspects that make ita bitconfus-
ing at first. There is a universal aspect: intelligence as a set of psycholog-
ical adaptations common to all normal humans, including capacities for 
learning language, using tools, and understanding other people's beliefs 
and 
Then there is an individual-differences aspect: intelligence 
as a set 
correlated differencC$ in the speed and efficiency of these 
natural human capacities, and in our abilities to master evolutionarily 
novel. counterintuitive concepts and skiUs such as proving geometnc 
theorems and sustaining lifelong monogamous marriages. InteUigence's 
universality means that all normal adult humans have some impres-
sive mental capacities for surviving, 
mating, and parent-
ing. Intelligence's variability means that some people are much better 
at these tasks than others. 
General intelligence (a.ka. IQ, general cognitive ability, the g fac-
tor} is a way of quantifying intelligence's variability among people. It is 
the best-established, most predictive, most heritable mental trait ever 
discovered in psychology. Whether measured with formal IQ tests 
or assessed through mformal conversations and observations, intelli-
gence predicts objective performance and learning ability across all 
important life domains that show reliable individual differences. 
The irony about general intelligence is that ordinary folks of aver-
age intelligence recognize its variance across people, its generality 
aCross domains, and its importance in life. Yet educated elltes mean-
while often remain implacably opposed to the very concept of general 
intelligence, and deny its variance, generality, and

high intelligence, so the width of the whole bell curve lies outside 
their frame of reference, I have met theoretical physicists who claimed 
that any human could understand superstring theory and quantum 
mechanics if only he or she waS given the right educational opportu-
nities, Of course, such scientists talk only with other physicists with 
IQs above 140, and seem to forget that their Janitors, barbers, and car 
mechanics are in 
real humans, too, so they can rest comfortably in 
the envy-deflecting delusion that there are no Significant differences 
in general intelligence, 
Even within my own field, evolutionary psychologists tend to mis-
understand general intelligence as a psychological adaptation in its own 
right, often misconstruing it as a specific mental organ, module, brain 
area, or faculty, However, it is not viewed that way by most intelligence 
researchers wbo, instead, regard general intelligence as an individual, 
differences construct-like the constructs "health," "beauty," or "sta-
tus," Health is not a bodily organ, it is an abstract construct or "latent 
variable" that emerges when one statistically analyzes the functional 
efficiencies of many different organs, Because good genes, diet, and 
exercise tend to produce good hearts, lungs, and anobodies, the vital 
effiCienCies of circulatofj', pulmonary, and immune systems tend to 
positively correlate, yielding a general "health" factor. Likewise, beauty 
is not a single sexual ornament like a peacock's tail; it is a latent vari-
able that emerges when one analyzes the attractiveness of many dif-
ferent sexual ornaments throughout the face and body (such as eyes, 
lips, skin, hair, chest, buttocks, and legs, plus general skin quality, 
hair condition, muscle tone, and optimal amount and distribution of 
fat), Similarly, general intelligence is not a mental organ, hut a latent 
variable that emerges when one analyzes the functional efficiencies 
of many different mental organs (such as memory, language ability, 
social perceptiveness, speed at learning practical skills, and musical 
aptitude), 
General intelligence seems to be a fairly good general index of 
genetic qoality (not having too many harmful mutations) and pheno, 
typic condition (having a healthy, efficient brain), This is why, aCross

any broad sample of ordinary people, general intelligence correlates 
positively with: 
• overall brain size (as measured in living people by structural 
MR1) 
• sizes of specific cortical areas (such as lateral 
medial 
prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex) 
• concentrations in the brain of particular neurochemicals (such 
as N-acetyl-aspartate) 
• age at which the cortex is thickest in childhood 
• speed of performing basic sensory-motor tasks (such as 
pushing buttons as soon as they light up) 
• speed with which nerve fibers carry impulses through 
arms 
and legs 
• beight 
• physical symmetry of the face and body 
• physical health 
• longevity 
• semen quality in males (sperm count, concentration, and 
motility) 
• mental health (lower rates of schizophrenia, post-traumatic 
stress, and other psychopathologies) 
• romantic attractiveness (at least for long-term relatIOnships) 
For example, I was involved in a couple of studies that examined rela-
tionships between intelligence and brain size, and intelligence and 
body symmetry, The psychologist Lars Pen ke and I reviewed all 
I ccn studies we could lind on the relationship between general intel-
ligence (as measured with reliable, valid IQ tests) and brain volume 
(as assessed by MRI brain imaging), In a total sample of 935 normal 
lIdlllts, general intelligence correlated +,43 with brain size-much 
higher than the correlation previously found between intelligence and 
(,>ltcrnal head size (about +.2), We also re\~ewed eight studies on the 
h('rilahility or brain size amonR twins and families, which showed an 

190 
S PE N T 
average heritability of .91 in a total sample of 2,494 normal adults-
a heritability as high as that found for any other human trait (such as 
height), and even higher than the .5 to .7 heritability found for intel-
ligence in mature adults. (Heritability measures the proportion of a 
trait·s variation acrOss individuals that can be explained by genetic 
differences between individuals, so it can range from 0 to L) Recent 
twin research has also found that there is a positive genetic correlation 
between intelligence and brain size, meaning that many genes have 
similar positive or negatIVe effects on both intelligence and brain size_ 
In other words, bigger brains are associated with higher intelligence 
not JUSt because the same environmental factors (nutrition, education) 
help or ham) both, but because the same genes help or harm both. So, 
general intelligence and brain size are highly heritahle, and they are 
moderately correlated at both the trait level and the genetic leveL This 
is just one piece of evidence suggesting that intelligence is a genuine 
individual-differ-ences trait with a deep biological basis. 
In another study, psychologists Mark Prokosch, Ron Yeo, and I 
studied the relationship between intelligence and body symmetry. We 
recruited seventy-eight male college students, and used digital calipers 
to measure their left-right symmetry at ten points on their bodies (such 
as ankle width, elbow 'vidth, ear width, ear length, finger lengths). Body 
symmetry is often measured in biology as an index of phYSIcal health, 
condition, genetic quality, andlor fitness. "Ve also gave the students five 
mental tests each (an excellent intelligence test caIJed Raven's matri-
ces, two decent intelligence tests based o!, vocabulary knowledge, and 
two tests of number memory that are rehable, but that are no! good 
measures of intelligence). We found that, across individuals, scores on 
the hest intelligence test (Raveds) correlated about +39 with overall 
body symmetry. We also found that the better a mental test was at 
measuring intelligence (the higher its 'g-loading," in technical terms), 
the mOre highly correlated its scores were with body symmetry across 
individuals. Other work by Ron Yeo and colleagues shows that higher 
body symmetry is also assOCiated with lower risks of neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders such as mental retardation and lower risks of mental ill-
Generollnlelligence 
191 
nesses such as schizophrenia. This suggests that the closer a mental 
test comes to measuring general intelligence, the closer it comes to 
measuring general health, fitness, and genetic quality. Again, iotelh-
gence appears to be a genuine biological trait with a deep connection to 
organic processes of bodily growth and brain efficiency. 
In the 1970s, critics of intelligence research such as Leon Kamin 
and Stephen Jay Gould wrote many diatribes insisting that general 
intelligence had none of these correlations with other biologic" 1 traits 
such as height, physical health. mental health, brain size, or nerve 
conduction speed. Mountains of research since then have shown that 
they were wrong, and today general intelligence dwells comfortably 
at the center of a whole web of empirical associations stretching from 
genetiCS through neuroscience to creativity research. Still, the anti-
intelligence dogma continues unabated, and a conspicuous contempt 
for IQ remains, among the liberal elite, a fashionable indicator of one's 
agreeableness and openness. 
Yet this overt contempt for the concept of intelligence has never 
undermined our universaJ worship of the intelligence-based meritoc-
racy thtlt drives ctlpitalist educational and occupational aspirations. All 
parents glow with pride when their children score well on standardized 
tests, get into elite universities that reguire high test scores, and pur-
sue careers that require elite universit), degrees. The anti-intelligence 
dogma has not deterred liberal elites from sulking and ranting "bout 
the embarraSSing stupidity of certain politicians, the inhumanity of 
inflicting capital punishment on murderers with subnormal IQs, or 
the IQ-harming effects of lead paint or prenatal alcoholism. Whenever 
policy issues are important enough, we turn to the concept of genera~, 
intelligence as a crucial explanatory variable or measure of cognitive 
health, despite our Gould-tutored discomfort with the idea. 
Educational Credentialism 
Yodvc probably heard that IQ tests are now widely conSidered out-
daled, biased, and useless, and that IhNe's more to cognitive ability

SPE NT 
than general intelligence~there are also traits like social intelligence, 
practical intelligence, emotional intelligence, creativity, and wisdom_ 
Stnkingly, these claims originate mostly from psychology professors at 
Harvard and Yale. Harvard is home to Howard Gardner, advocate of 
eight "multiple intelligences" (linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, 
musical, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and natural-
ist). Yale is home to Peter Salovey, advocate of emotional intelligence, 
and was, until recently, home to Rohert Sternberg, advocate of three 
intelligences (academic, social, and practical). (To be fair, I thmk the 
notions of interpersonal, social, and emotional intelligence do have 
some merit, but they seem more like socially desired combinations of 
general intelligence, agreeableness, conscientiousness, andlor extraver-
sion than distinctive dimensions that extend beyond the Central Six.) 
Is it an accident that researchers at the most expensive, elite, IQ-
screening universities tend to be most skeptical of IQ tests) I think 
not. Universities offer a costly, slow, unreliable intelligence,indicating 
product that competes directly with cheap, fast, more-reliable lQ tests. 
They are now in the business of educational credentialism. Harvard 
and Yale sell nicely printed sheets of paper called degrees that cost 
about $J60,000 ($40,000 for tuition, room, board, and books per year 
for four years). To obtain the 
one must demonstrate a decent 
level of consciencousness, emotional stability, and openness in one's 
coursework, but above all, one must have the intelligence to get admit-
ted, based on SAT scores and high school grades. Thus, the Han>ard 
degree is basically an IQ guarantee. 
Elite universities do not want to be undercut by' competitors. They 
do not want their expensive IQ,warranties to suffer competition fTom 
cheap, fast IQ tests, which would commodify the intelugence-display 
market and drive down costs. Therefore, elite umversities have a hyp-
ocritical, love-hate relationship with intelligence tests. They use the 
IQ,type tests (such as the SAT) to select students, to ensure that their 
IQ-warranties have validity and credibility. Yet they seem to agree with 
the claim by Educational Testing Service that the SAT is not an IQ 
test, and they vehemently deny thm their d"grc~s could he replaced

tain the social norm that, in casual conversation, it is acceptable to 
mention where one went to college, but not to mention 
SAT or

There are vested interests at work here, including not Just the uni, 
versities hut the testing services The most important U.S. intelligence-
testing institution is the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which 
administers the SAT, LSAT, MCAT, and GRE tests. ETS is a private 
organi7.ation with ahout 2,500 employees, including 250 Ph.D.s. It 
apparently functions as an unregulated monopoly, accountable only 
to its board of trustees. Although nominally dedicated to the highest 
standards of test validity, E1'5 is also under intense legal pressure to 
create tests that "are fTe" of racial, ethnic, gender, socioeconomic, and 
other forms of bias," This means, in practice, that ETS must attempt 
the impossible. It must develop tests that accurately predict univer' 
sity performance by assessing general intelligence, since general intel, 
ligence remains by far the best predictor of acadentic achievement. Yet 
since intelligence testing remains such a politically incendiary topic 
in the United States, it is crucial for ETS to take the pOSition that its 
"aptitude" and "achievement" tests are not tests of general intelligence. 
Purther, its tests must avoid charges of bias by yielding precisely 
equal distributions of scores across different ethnic groups, sexes, and 
classes-even when t.hose groups do have somewhat different distri-
blltions of general intelligence. So, the mOre accurate the tests are 
as indexes of general intelligence, the more biased they look across 
groups, and the more flack ETS gets from political activists. On the

the best it can, given the hypocrisies, tahoos, and legal constraints of 
the American cognitive meritocracy. However, it may be useful for

If a university degree basically functions as an IQ guarantee, then a 
degree's social status and economic value should he more strongly pre-
dicted by the average SAT scores of graduating students, rather than 
the average knowledge 
by those students. An IQ-guarantee 
degree is what economists call a positional good-a way of showing 
one's personal superiority over competitors, Positional goods often lead 
to runaway status competition. Once an Ivy League undergraduate 
degree becomes popular and therefore less useful as a badge of 
tinction, competitors feel obligated to raise the bar and go for an Ivy 
League M.B.A., M.D., or Ph.D. Once an ordinary M.B.A. becomes 
popular and therefore Jess distinctive, competitors may pursue the 
more demanding Trium Global Executive M.B.A. for $87,000, in 
whkh an elite group of forty senior managers take six trips around the 
world to study at the London School of Economics, the New York Uni, 
versity 
School of Business, and the HEC School of Management 
in Paris, plus rotating locations in the Far East and emerging markets. 
universities do not rely so heav~ly on standardized testing. 
Instead, their admissions system depends mostly on eighteen,year-
old students' standardized test scores in demanding "A-lever courses, 
which are roughly equivalent to American college sophomore courses. 
Oxford and Cambridge also challenge applicants' brains and nerves 
with tough interview questions, such as: 
• "\Vhat percentage of the world's water is contained in a cow?" 
• "Are you your hody?" 
Generollntelligence 
195 
• "Was Russia just too damned big for democracy?" 
• "'Why don't we have JUSt one ear in the middle of our face?" 
• "What about fatalism?" 
Although such questions may not measure intelligence with the same 
reliability and validity as the SAT, they give interviewers some sense of 
the applicant's verbal floency, creativity. and background knowledge. 
result is that in Britain, too, an elite university 
functions 
as an intelligence guarantee. 
Credentialism explains the three hundred "diploma mills" (unac-
C"""'lea online universities) now operating in the United States, such 
as Rochville University and Belford UniverSity. These award B.A.5, 
M.B.A.s, or Ph.D.s within seven days on the basis of "life and work 
experience" ("Get a degree for what you already know!"), with no admis-
sions requirements, attendance, classes, essays, or tests. For example, 
Belford University's "complete doctorate degree package costs only $549 
with free shipping," and includes one degree, two transcripts, One award 
of excellence, one certificate of distinction, and fou.r education verifica-
tion letters for employers. Available majors 
aerospace engineer-
ing, cHnical psychology, endodontics, and, of course, marketing. Degree 
mills typically claim accreditation from fronts such as the International 
Accreditation Agency for Online Universities, which is not one of the 
nineteen accrediting organizations recognized by the U.S. Department 
of Education. From 1980 through the early 19905, the FBI Operation 
Diploma Scam task force closed down many of these diploma mills. 
However, there is now virtually no policing of them, and the \Veb

An alternative to the credentiahst view of higher education is the 
"human capital" view promoted by most professors, including econo-
mists such as Gary Becker. Their starting point is Bertrand Russell's 
insight that "the average man's opinions are much less foolish than they 
would be if he thought for himself." The human capital view is that the 
cultural transmission of knowledge makes us smarter and wiser, and that 
it is the responsibility of education to download such knowledge into our 
heads, so that we become more valuable to employers, and earn higher 
salaries. Education, in other words) is economic sel£-investment-we 
forgo some lost wage years in return for higher wages later. Aml it, is 
a fairly safe investment, baning brain injury or early dementia: Ben 
Franklin observed, "If a man empties his purse into his skull, no one can 
take it from him." 
The human-capital view argues that education actually confers 
"added value" on students, making them better workers and citizens 
who are more usefu I to society by transforming latent talene, into 
manifest skiUs and knowledge. A problem with this view is that there 
are much mOre efficient ways to learn career-relevant skills and facts: 
through reading books, watching docllmentaries. talking with experts, 
and finding mentors. In Good Will Huniing, the title character, a self-
educated genius, mocks the Harvard students; "You wasted $150,000 
On an education you coulda got for a buck fifty in late charges at the 
public Ubrary." Charles William Eliot, Harvard's president from 1869 
to 1909, admitted. "One could get a first-class education from a shelf 
of books five feet long" -as long as it was the right five feet, such as 
the fifty volumes of HU11!ard Classics that he edited. The maSSlVe rise 
in homeschooling shows that many parents ha\'c come to realize that 
learning, especially below the college level, need not depend on cre-
dentialed schoo!s.

Comp"nies understand perfectly well that higher education is not 
the most efficient way to prepare employees, which is why they spend 
more than $10 billion per year on corporate training in the United 
States (versus higher education spending of $200 billion per year). For 
example, three-quarters of the Fortune 500 companies have bought 
corporate training from the FranklinCovey group (2007 sales: about 
$ 280 million 1. founded by Stephen R. Covey after his 1989 bemelier

The credentialist view suggests that higher education may offer 
not so much added value in the economic sense as a reliable method 
of advertiSing one's talents--especially intelligence, conscientious-
ness, and openness. Other credible views of education are also skep-
tical about its alleged added value. These include the "warehousing" 
view which holds that mass public education is just cheap child care 
for working parents, and the "confonnism" view, which contends that 
school socializes children to be reliable, politically paCified wage slaves.

altitudes (as in some humanities and social sciences) to harder courSes 
that require the acquisition of real skills, knowledge, and insight (as 
in foreign languages, studio art and music, and the physical, biologi' 
cal, and behavioral sciences), Most students want to maximize their 
grade point average (a credentialist goal), not the amount of challeng-
ing, counterintuitive, life-relevant material they learn (a value-added 
goal), 
This apparently lazy strategy makes sense for most students, Indeed, 
lingering snobbery often assigns a higher e(:onomic value to degrees 
that are apparently less career relevant. Stanford Law School may 
prefer an Ivy League history graduate to a pre,law government major 
from a state college; the BBC often opts for Oxford English degrees 
over Nottingham degrees in media studies, The highly selective cre-
dential with little relevant content often trumps the less-selective cre-

General intelligence is such a powerful predictor of job performance 
that a content-free IQ guarantee can be much more valuable to all 
employer or graduate school than a set of rote,learned content with 
no 1Q guarantee, This darif,es many otherwise puzzling aspects of 
higher education, such as the common early-twentieth-century view 
that "a gentleman need not know Latin, but he should at least have 
forgotten it." At least my Latin teachers at Walnut Hills High School 
(Cincinnati, Ohio) were open about why we had to learn to read Vir-

Other Intelligence Indicators 
Educational credentials are by no meanS the only products we buy 
to display our intelligence, Intellectual narcissism, refracted through

stay informed (capable of impressive dinner-party chatter) by huying

draft of the chapter "Eumaeus" ftom Ulysses in July 2001 for £861,250 
from Sotheby's. 
The goods and services marketed to boost apparent intelligence 
span the whole of human life. Parents encourage children to boost 
their conspicuous cognitive skills through IQ-building toys, private 
schools, recreational reading, music lessons, and cultural field trips.

Even products that used to be

complex features that they have become re[iable intelligence indica-
tors. This "feature creep" (the ever,increasing number and complexity 
of controls and features) is driven partly by the need to make each 
new product model different from last year's, but also partly by the 
consumer's unconscious desire for a product that is right at the limit 
of his cognitive ability, and one that therefore functions as a credi-
ble cognitive display. Consider sewing machines. The iconic Singer

to one gigabyte of onboard memory, before it sews them at up to eight 
hundred stitches per minute across surfaces up to 8" by II ", It can also 
produce 307 preprogrammed stitch patterns, three lettering fonts, and 
thirteen buttonhole patterns. Although easy and intuitive to use for 
basic sewing tasks, it would take an extraordinary mind to fully exploit 
its capabilities. 
More adventurous techno-enthusiasts may get a private pilot's m_,;;me, 
which requires intellectually demanding ground trnining (flight planning, 
navigation, aerodynamics, air traffic control rules, weather theory), flight 
training, and about $100 per hour of airplane rental time. If a private 
pilot has survived a few thousand flying hours, you can be pretty sure he 
or she is highly intelligent, conscientious, and emotionally stable. Evolu-

Deep Shredder 9 from Chess Base ($50 on CD-ROM), which gives 
access to 2.7 million games played by grand masters. The current fad

Unlike crosswords, sudoku requires no verbal background knowledge; 
unlike chess, it can be played alone; unlike gossjping publicly on one's

Active online equity trading (day-trading) is an even more chal-
lenging, higher-stakes intelligence-indicating game. Every rational 
investor knows that the stock Illarket is virtually random in its move~ 
ments, and that the most reliable long-term bet is an index-tracking 
fund ,,~th annual expenses under 0.5 percent. It's hard to beat the 
market, because large investment banks can use insider information, 
employ highly paid experts, and use automated trading software that 
can analyze hundreds of variables. Because each online trade by a pri-
vate investor costs about $10, the expected return from active trading 
is negative. Nevertheless, many investors try to outsmart the market 
through their own research. \-Vhy? Because it's a thrilling intellectual

More subtly. the iPod and the BMW 500i both contain the letter i to 
suggest the intelligence of their users. Marketers more often than not 
confuse intelligence with wealth, status, t.aste, class, or education, and 
don't understand the distinctive product attributes that bright con-
sumers actually seek to display their brightness. Marketing types don't 
understand that tech-savvy males unconsciously respond to prod-
uct technical specifications not as useful features they'd enjoy, but 
as impressive properties that they'll be able to talk about in impres-
sively articulate, IQ-displaying ways. A bag of Smartfood popcorn, 
once opened, cannot be put aside by any normal human until it is 
fully consumed, so it provides an opportunity to display one's intelli-

cation aids (maps, books, phones, e·mail. PowerPoint), and social reci-
procity aids (money, invoices, checks, debit cards). Such products are 
like cognitive crutches. 
Other products aim to boost human mental abilities beyond the

books, toys, and games. 
Less explicitly, for decades toy brands have inlplied that products for

cybernetics, genetic engineering, stem cells, nanotechnolog)', cogni-

the behavioral issues that are likely to arise when such technologies 
hit the consumer retail market. One prediction is obvious: even for 
commercialized transhumanist products that offer nothing more than 
a placebo effect, early adopters will acquire and display them mainly 
as ind.icators of intelligence and openness. It won't matter whether the 
first ten-terabyte nanoneural implant actually does make the customer

and dearly branded, it will sell as a costly,

Openness 
OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE is a piquant trait, delectable to some 
but disgusting to many, Its evolutionary origins are obscure, its dan-
gers are often underestimated, and the environmental variables that 
predict it are strangely mundane. 
it has prodigious importance in 
creativity, courtship, and cultural progress, 
Wherever you stand on the openness spectrum, those Jess open 
thaD you seem boring, dull, conventlOnal, and conformist, whereas the 
more open seem eccentrlc 1 bizarre, disruptive, threatening, or even 
psychotic, Given this diversity of openness levels, and the resulting 
diversity of preferences for different degrees of openness in family, 
friends, and mates, there is less incentive for people to fake their open· 
ness than their intelligence, If you pretend to have higher openness 
than you really do, you may be transiently attractive to those more 
open than you, but you'll be less attractive to those less open than you, 
The net result will be no higher social or sexual popularity. In fact, 
given the bell curve of openness, the more you de\'iatefrom an average 
level of openness, the fewer peoplc you are likely to attract. 
This means that where openness is concerned, consumers can some-
times display cheap, reliable openness badges that are fairly credible, 11 
also means that consumerist capitalism caters very well to the whole 
range of openness. There are highly open cities (Vancouver, Amster, 
dam, Bangkok), and less-open suburbs (Langley, Virginia; Wimbledon,

Why Parasites Reduce Openness 
Some exciting new research s.hows that a surprising environmental 
factor--the risk of parasitic infection (or "parasite load")-predicts 
lower openness, lo\vcr extraversion, lower individualism, and lower 
liberalism across individuals and societies. This research. led by biol-
ogists Corey Fincher and Randy Thornhill at University of New Mex-
ico, and Mark Schaller and Damian Murray at University of British 
Columbia, illuminates the nature of openness and the reasons why it 
varies across individuals. 
The scientific teom's reasoning is that before modern sanitation 
and medicine, the most important causes of human disease, death, 
and infertiliry were parasites (colloquially, "germs"; technically, "patho-
gens"). All large-bodied species of animals and plants are in a constant 
state of biological warfare against dozens of kinds of smaller-bodied 
parasites. The big problem is that the parasites-,'iruses, bacteria, 
protozoa, and worms-are so minuscule and short-lived that they can 
evoJve very quickly-much faster than their larger, longer-lived hosts, 
such as humans. Some of these alien organisms evohre to form sym-
biotic relationships with their hosts. These include most of the 100 
trillion or so microbes that live in the human gut, which collectively 
contain one hundred times as many different genes as the human 
genome does. However, many of these alien organisms remain evolu-
tionary enemies with harmful effects on health and reproduction. 
Openness 
209 
In response, vertebrate animals have evolved a svstem of biochemi-
cal defenses that can learn, during the host's own'lifetime, to recog-
nize and attack dangerous local parasites if they enter the host's body. 
This defense system, which is called the adaptive immune system, is 
composed mainly of the 2 trillion lymphocytes in our blood and lym-
phatiC system. which collectively weigh as much as the human brain. 
Each person's lymphocytes learn to fight off the particular variet-
ies of parasites that are commOn within his own local group, which 
gives him an immunological memory of the parasites he has already 
encountered. (ImmuniZiltion is simply the process of teaching the 
lymphocytes about a new kind of pathogen by exposing them to safer, 
deactivated forms of the pathogen.) However, the immune system's 
learned parasite resistance is highly localized, People from other kin 
groups, clans, tribes, ethnic groups, or races-even if they live just 
a few miles away-may host other varieties of parasites that evolved 
slightly different ways of being transmitted to hosts, infecting them, 
and making them sick. 
Thus, any interaction with outsiders brings a high risk of acquir-
ing a new kind of parasite that may be especially hard for one's locally 
adapted immune system to fight off. The higher the parasite load-
the gre2ter the number, variety. and severity of parasites surround-
ing one's 10ca.1 grollpthe higher that risk is and the more "",utious 
people should be about strangers. They should develop a more pro-
active "psychological immune system" to avoid getting their mouths, 
noses, genitals, or skin anywhere close to potential sources of infec-
tion. They should be much more averse to contact with other groups, 
including not just their human members, but also their food, clothing, 
shelters, animals, social customs, hygiene practices, and purification 
rituals-anything assOCiated with possible parasite transmission. In 
other words, people in high-parasite regions will benefit from becom-
ingmore xenophobic (fearful of out-groups) and ethnocentric (focused 
on their own in-group). (This effect is so robust that it even occurs in 
virtual worlds, as in the "Corrupted Blood" plague that rdvngcd World 
of Warcraft in ScptemlJ<'f 2005. Some infected "griders" intentionally 

210 
S PE N T 
spread the plague to highly populated areas of the game-world, killing 
up to half the characters on some servers; players quicklr learned to 
avoid major cities.) 
On the other hand, if the environment is cold, dry, or otherwise 
hostile to parasite transmission, the parasite load will be lower, the 
risks of communicable disease will be lower, and the costs of interact-
ing with outsiders will be lower. Since interaction with out'groups can 
bring fitness benefits-new trading opportunities, resources, knowl, 
edge, inventions, mates, friends, allies, and genes-people in low-
parasite regions should evolve or learn to 
more advantage of these 
benefits by acting more cosmopolitan. They should evolve or learn to 
act less xenophobic and ethnocentnc as groups. They should also grow 
more open and extraverted as individuals, because higher openness 
drives people to seek out new ideas, experiencf~', places. and ClJtures, 
and higher extraversion drives people to seek out new mates, friends, 
and allies. 
In an extraordinary series of recent papers, Fincher, Thornhill, 
Schaller and Murray have bet'.n confirming all these predictions. Their 
, 
. 
methods were fair!y simple: for each of ninety-eight territories (nations 
and city,states) selected from around the world, they added up 
medically documented prevalences of nine parasites already known 
to reduce human reproductive fitness (leishmania, schistOSOma, try-
panosoma, malaria, filaria, leprosy, dengue, typhus, and tuberculosis). 
Then they looked at whether this measure of parasite load predicts 
political and social attitudes and Big Five personality traits across the 
different territories. 
For example, in a 2008 paper. Schaller and Murray suggested that 
openness and extraversion would be lower in territories where people 
sllffer from higher parasite loads. 
gathered data on average Big 
Five personality scorcs from three previous studies that had each ana-
lyzed thirty,three, fifty, or fifty-six of the ninety'eight territories for 
which the parasite loads were known. Across the seventy' one territOries 
for which 
had hoth parasite-load data and personality data, they 
found that people from territories with the highest parasite load indeed 
Openness 
211 
had substantially lower openness and extraversion scores on average. 
For the twcnt}'·three territories where Big Five scores could be averaged 
across all three previous studies (yielding the most accurate estimates), 
the correlations were guite strong: -.6 bet ween parasite load and open-
ness, and about the same for extraversion. These correlations remained 
substantial even after controlling for differences across territories in 
average annual temperature, distance from the equator (absolute lati-
tude), life expectancy, GDP per capita, or political attitudes (indh~du­
alism versus collectivism). Schaller and Murray sugge>~ed that these 
personalit}' shifts could happen in three complementary ways: evolu-
tionary changes across generations in the genes underlying personalit}', 
environmental influences on the expression of personality genes during 
individual development, andlor cultural changes across historical time 
in the norms governing social interaction. 
In another 2008 paper Fincner, Thornhill, Schaller, and Murray 
analyzed data on the "individualism versus collectivism" dimension, 
the political attitude variable that has been most thoroughly studied in 
crosscultural and poHtical psychology. Collectivists make stronger dis, 
tinctions between in-group and out-group, are warier of contact with 
strangers and foreigners, and highly value tradition and conformity. 
Relatively "collectivist" cultures include China, India. and countries in 
the Middle East and Africa; relatively "individualist" cultures include 
the United 
and the nations of western Europe, especially Scan, 
dinavia. The researehers gathered data on average individualism/col-
lectivism scores from four previous studies that had each analyzed 
sixty,eight, fifty, eight, fifty'seven, or seventy territories for which par' 
asite loads were known. Across the ninety-eight territories, the various 
measures of collectivism correlated strongly with current parasite load 
(correlations ranging from .44 to 59), and even mare strongly with 
historical parasite load from about a century ago (correlations ranging 
from .63 to .73). (This makes sense: a territory's collectivism level is 
likely to show some cultural lag when responding to rapid reductions 
in parasite loads due to modem sanitation and medicine.). Even con-
trolling for the four variables known from previous research to predict 

212 
S PEN T 
collectivism across culwres--life expectancy, population density, 
CDP per capita, and the Cini index of economic inequality-parosite 
load still predicted collecti,ism qmte STrongly (In the United States, 
"collectivism" means being Republican, Fundamentalist, pro-military, 
and/or anti-immigration; "individualism" means being DemocratiC, 
secular, internationalist, andior antiracism_ In the United Kingdom 
collectivists tend to be Conservative or old Labour, Anglican or Mus-
lim, pro-royalty, and/or anti-European Union; individualists tend to 
be Liberal Democrat Or New Labour, secular, viewers of BBC2 and 
Channci4, and pro-EU_) 
Does vulnerability to parasites also predict differences in open-
ness, extraversion, and individuahsm acroSS individuals, even within 
the same culture? To put a finer point on it: do O_S, Republicans and 
0_ K Consen'atives hold the values that they do, not as a function of 
rational political convictions, but hecause they unconsciously assess 
that they have weaker immune systems? Some recent studies suggest 
so_ The evolutionary researchers Dan Fessler, David Navarette, and 
Mark Schaller have found that "percei,'ed vulnerability to disease"-
an individual's self-rated susceptibility to getting colds, infections, and 
communicable diseases--does predict that individual's xenophobia_ 
Also, looking at photographs of parasites and disease symptoms has 
been shown to make people more xenophobic, at least temporarily_ A 
final piece of evidence relies on the fact that women's immune systems 
grow adaptively weaker during first-trimester pregnancy, so that their 
bodies don't reject the fetlls as an alien parasite_ \/'/omen in the first 
trimester also show higher xenophobia, as if they unconsciously 
ize that their weaker immune systems will have more trollble fighting 
off new infections from outsiders; this xenophobia becomes weaker as 
theIr immune systems become stronger in the second trimesteL More 
generally, people's openness, extraversion, and individualism tend to 
peak in young adulthood when their immune systems are strongest, 
and tend to decline throughout middle age as their health declines_ 
All this research suggests that there are surprisingly strong con-
nections between parasite loads, immune systems, personality Iraits,

and political attitudes-connectJons that have profound imp.lications 
for undersb:mding the nature of openness, the reasons why it varies 
across people and cultures, and the ways that cOnsumers try unCOn-
sciously to display their levels of openness_ These connections also 
have surprising implications for economic and political policy_ For 
instance, the best way to promote democracy, science, secularism, 
peace, ethnic harmony, free trade, and tourism in developing nations 
may be to reduce their parasite load through better medicine and sani-
tation_ As foreign policy tools, immunizations and mosquito nets may 
be much stronger than diplomacy, trade agreements, economic sanc-
tions, loons, warfare, or propaganda, because these simpler measures 
increase openness, extraversion, and individualism more effectively, 
and reduce xenophobia and ethnocentrism mOre quickly_ Medecins 
sans Frontieres and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation may be 
promoting the cultural liberalization of developing nations mOre 
effectively than the UN, WTO, and World Bank combined_ Indeed, 
Randy Thomhill has argued that this liberalization-through-parasite-
reduction is exactly what happened in the United States and Europe 
during the twentieth century, The baby boomers, for example, were 
not only the first generation in the United States to grow up benefit-
ing from broad-spectrum childhood immunizations, but were also the 
first generation to show a sudden massive increase in interracial toler~ 
ance, jntenlationalism, openness, and individualism, as manifest in 
the civil rights movement, the peace movement, the New Left, the 
psychedelic revolution, the sexual revolution, and the "Me" generation, 
The consen'at;ve backlash benefited from the disco-era genital herpes 
epidemic and especially from the 1980s AIDS crisis, which increased 
everyone's perceived vulnerabiUty to communicable disease_ 
Four Forms of Disgust 
As we have seen, low openness has some biological benefits in avoiding 
new infectious diseases from unfamiliar people, groups, foods, 
and hygiene practices, These beneGts ar(, dNived not just from a 

2~4 
SPE NT 
cool-headed distaste for the new and the different, but by a hot-blooded 
disgust at the bizarre and the alien. To better understand openne.%. it 
may help to consider the nature of disgust. 
The evolutionary psychologist Joshua Tybur argues that humans 
experience three distinct fonns of disgust. There is antiparasite dis· 
gust, which protects us from contagious disease. There is sexual dis-
gust, which protects us from mating with individuals who are too 
closely related, or whose genetic quality is too low. Finally, there is 
moral disgust, which protects us from selfish individuals who would 
undermine local social norms and social contracts. Each type of dis-
gust is triggered by different stimuli (rancid meat, lustful siblings, or 
psychopaths) and provokes different behaviors (vomiting, sexual aver' 
sion, or \~gilante justice). 
I think there may also be a fourth t),pe of disgust, a sort of "cul-
tural disgust," that protects uS from contact with infectious memes 
that may prove dangerous given our psycholOgical vulnerabilities. Thls 
is the sort of disgust that was aroused in low-openness people by mod-
ern art in ] 9305 Berlin and by tie-dyed T-shirtS in 19605 Texas. It is 
precisely the sort of disgust exploited by rabid conservative talk-show 
hosts, who are not jllst frightened by pathogens, incest, and psycho-
paths, but by cerlain ideas that they consider dangerously attractive, 
memorable. transmissible, and psychosis inducing. They portray the 
carriers of these ideas as craZ\' liheral zombies, tainted by an ideologi. 
ca 1 epidemic beyond their control, who must be put down before the 
contagion spreads. 
People who (unconsciously) understand that their own immune 
system is vulnerable-the sick, the elderly, pregnant women in the 
first trimester, inhabitants of areas with high parasite loads-typically 
experience stronger antiparasite disgust Like\vise, people who uncon-
sciously understand that their own memal health is vulnerable may 
experience stronger cultural disgust and lower openness. Whenever 
you hear a conservative broadcaster such as Bill O'Reilly ranting against 
~ome new idea, imagine him as am icted by the cognitive equivalent 
of severe combined immunodefiCiency syndrome. (This is the weak-
Openness 
215 
immune·system condition that forced David Vetter, the "Bubble Boy," 
to stay at home and live in an antiseptic plastic tent, lest he he kiUed 
by the germs that we routinely shrug off) O'Reilly might be rightly 
intuiting that if he seriously considered a wider range of nO\'e! ideas, 
his sanity might collapse. (Or, his ideological defenses may be mis· 
calibrated and he may have become overvigilant against ideological 
infection, in a way more analogous to autoimmune disease.s, such as 
allergic asthma_) 
Conspicuous displays of immune system strength are fairly com· 
mon across cultllres. Especially in areas with high parasite loads, many 
tribal people open their skin 10 infection when they arc young adults, 
through scarification or tattooing Of forced genltal mutilation, to show 
that their immune systems are strong enough to survive the wounds. 
(The 5,300-year·old body of "Ot2.i the iceman," discovered in the Ital-
ian Alps in 1991, had ruty,seven tattoos.) If you are a healthy, ener-
getic young mall or woman covered in well· healed self-inflicted scars, 
despite living in a high·parasite area, you have credibly demonstrated 
that your health is very strong. Potential mates and friends may not 
consciously understand the connections between costly signaling the-
ory, microscopic parasites, scarification using unslerilb.ed tools, and 
individual differences in the number and efficiency of the lympho-
cytes that constitute the adapti"'e immune system. However, they Can 
unconSciously assess that you would not be looking healthy or ener-
getic after having endured so many cuts if you were weak and sickly. 
Biologists such as W. D. Hamilton and Anders M0Her have argued 
that in many other animal specie.~, sexual ornaments have evolved as 
indicators of parasite resistance. 
The phenomenon of "cutting" among American teenagers baffles 
parents and doctors, but may be an example of thls SOft of ritual scari, 
fication. It rarely has suicidal intent but does often lead to infections, 
and teens who have few other ways to raise their social status often say 
it makes them feel cool. As with almost all human behaviors, the envi-
ronmental risks factors for cutting (poverty, unemployment, uncaring 
parcnts, childhoOQ a"us~, rotllHn[ic hC'lftbrcak) and the consciolls 

216 
SPENT 
motives for cutting (feeling sad, lonely, numb, lost, alienated, over-
whelmed) may have little relation to the evolutionary origins or hidden 
adaptive functions of the behavior, except insofar 35 they reveal that 
the behavior is a high-risk, last-ditch tactic for boosting one's social 
sa hence to parents or mates, Or one's status among peers" (Only about 
10 percent of teens report having cut themselves.) Tattoos, earrings, 
body piercings, and other self-inflicted breaches of the skin may func-
tion in a similar way as a reliable display of immune system strength. 
Of course, to suggest that cutting and body piercing arise from evolved 
human instincts to display immune system strength is not to argue 
that they are either morally good Or medically advisable, 
In developed countries, we llave less to fear from infectious para, 
sites, but much mOre to 
from infectious memes. So, instead of 
opening our bodies to ambient germs, we open our minds to ambient 
culture, to determine if we can stay sane throughout the onslaught. 
When you see teenagers and young adults posting theu interests in 
music, books, and film on their MySpaee websites, consider the costly 
signaling principles at work. If they have exposed themselves to a lot 
of death metal, Chuck Palahniuk, and David Lynch, and they are 
still sane enough to sustain a reasonable conversation through e'mail 
or instant messaging, they have credibly proven their openness and 
psychosis-resistance. The main danger is that if they only recently got 
into such extreme forms of culture, the psychosis could still hit in the 
next few montbs, following other stressors. An individual with II long-
standing appreciation of Lynch's Blue Velvet (1986) is therefore a safer 
bet than one with a newly acquired enthusiasm for inland Empire 
(2006). 
Certain extreme ideas may present minimal danger to those with 
strong antipsychosis defenses, who can therefore afford to act highly 
open. But those same ideas may present genuine dangers to those 
with weaker defenses, who mllst minimize their openness. If these 
outlandish speculations have any merit, then people who are low in 
openness prefer to assodate with One another in part to protect their 
sanity. They seek out communities, jobs, lifestyles, maWs, friends, amI

products that will not challenge their antipsychosis defenses, They 
prefer the familiar to the novel, the conventional to the radical the 
predictable to the challenging. They prefer goods and services th:t are 
heavy on matter and habit, and light on cognition and imagination. 
They move to comfortably anti'intellectual communities: rural towns 
or ethnically homogeneous suburbs around provincial cities, such as 
Indianapolis, Indiana. or Augsburg, Germany; large, progressive, mul-
ticultural cities are just too threatening. They shop in national chain 
stares and eat in chain restaurants, because locallv owned businesses 
are too quirky and unpredictable. They minimiz~ their exposure to 
"serious culture"-that is, weird, potentially infectious memes-and

'Why Don't We All Want Maximum Openness? 
Openness is a dangerotls trait in several ways. It can lead to social 
embarrassment \-vhen one's behavior is too weird or novel. It can lead 
to one's brain getting infected by maladaptive memes-false informa-
tion, dumb ideologies, conspiracy theories. It can lead one to join a 
cult, enroll in art schooL or move to Santa 
For example, while openness is strongly correlated with creativity, it 
is also correlated with psychosis (loss of contact with reality). To study 
conelanons, my colleague !lantt Tal and I asked 
University of 
New Mexico students to complete six tests of vcrbal creativity and eight 
tests of drawing creativity, along with meaSures of the Central Six traits. 
Our six verbal creativity tasks included questions like: "Imagine that 
all clouds had really long strings hanging from them-strings hundreds 
of feet long. What would be the implications of that fact for nature and 
, ," 
I "If

kind of animal for a day, what kind of animal would you want to be, and 
why)" For the eight drawing creativity tasks, students were asked to cre-
ate four abstract drawings (for example, "Please draw an abstract sym-
bol, pattern, or composition that represents the taste of pure, rich, dark 
chocolate") and four representational drawings (for example, "Please 
draw what an alien civilization might look like on a distant planet")_ The 
students' responses were rated independently for their creativity by four 
expert raters, who showed very good agreement \vith one another_ 
The students also answered sevenry,four questions about ,,+tether 
they had e_'perienced various symptoms of schizotypy-a form of mild 
schizophrenia_ People with schizotypy tend to have both "positive" 
symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, a belief that people can read 
their mind, odd speech, and odd behavior), and "negative" symptoms 
(flat emotions, few friends, social anxiety, paranoia)_ For example, 
people tend to get a high score on schizotypy if they say yes to many of 
these positive symptom items, 
• I often hear a voice speaking my thoughts aloud_ 
• Some people think that I am a very bizarre person. 
• I believe in telepathy_ 
• People sometimes stare at me because of my odd appearance. 
• Parts of my body sometimes seem unreal or disconnected_ 
(Most college students answer yes to at least a few such items, so if 
you did, too, don't panic.) 
We found that openness has moderate positive correlations with 
both general intelligence (30) and positive schizotypy (.29). Open-
ness predicts both verbal creallviry (.34) and drawing creativiry (.46). 
Intelligence also predicts both verbal creativity (35) and drawing ere-
ati,'ity (.29). Schizotypy predicts creativiry very weakly, but once you 
control for openness, it does not predict creativiry at all, Thus, cre-
ativity is best predicted by positive responses to openness questions, 
rather than schizotypy questions_ 
The implication is that there is a link between madness and crl'-

mediated by openness_ Openness bas creativity benefits and extreme 
openness shades over into psychosis, but the psychOSiS isot generat-
ing any creative work; It'S just a harmful side effecL This is yet more 
evidence that very high openness is a dangerous game, with poten-
tially high payoffs in creativity, but potentially catastropmc effects on 
mental health_ In a complex, media-rich society, perhaps only people 
with very good mental health can tolerate a high degree of openness 
without losing their equilibrium. 
It is important to remember that openness is not correlated posi-
tively or negatively with emotional stabiliry_ High openness is asso-
ciated with mild psychosis, whereas low stability is associated with 
neurO-'is-anxiety, \Vorry, depression_ The speculation here is that 
high openness plus high stability and high intelligence yields high ere, 
ativity and social attractiveness_ Conversely. high openness plus low 
stability yields a high risk of mental illness_ 
How ~luch Openness Can You Take? 
These findings suggest a hypotheSis that I admit is highly specula-
tive, but that is nonetheless intriguing' people may use conspicuous 
displays of openness as a guarantee of their mental health-especially 
their resistance to developing schizotypy. schizophrenia, or other forms 
of psychosis_ Because schizophrenia tends to develop in early adult-
hood, it is especially important for adolescents and young adults to dis-
play their psychosis resistance_ If you're a young woman, you want to 
avoid falling in love with a guy when he's seventeen, having two chil-
dren with him, and then seeing him develop debilitating schizophrenia 
when he's twenry-three, So, adolescents play with fire, exposing them-
selves to ideas, experiences, and drugs that would induce psychosis

The Embarrassment and Danger Costs of Openness 
Psychosis is not the only danger of openness. High openness, in my 
experience, can often get one into embarrassing situations that may 
lower one's social and sexual status, or even threaten one·s safety, The 
highly open may emerge soaked in fake blood from a Gwar concert 
and be mistaken hy police for a homicidal maniac. They may suffer 
burns and hearing loss from attending an illegal performance by the 
giant flame'throwjng robots of Survival Research Labs under High-
way tol in San Francisco, They may be chased through the streets of 
Fez by furious temple guards for having kissed an English gi r!friend in 
the Karaouine mosque, They may become evolutionary psychologists, 
which typically leads to unemployment and ostracism. 
Openness to new experiences can even lead to physical danger or 
addiction, Athletic novelty seekers may run our of arrunary sports to

• dolphin therapy (emotional healing through "energy transfers" 
from contact with dolphins) 
• Gerson therapy (drinking vast amounts of fruit juice, plus 
coffee enemas)

Openness, Novelty, and Fashion 
Low-openness consumers remain content \Vith traditional products 
that have traditional features and designs, They're a tough sen, because 
they don't valu" novelty for its own sake, They are happy wearing uni-
forms instead of fashions: school uniforms, sports uniforms, military 
uniforms, business suits, golfing weaL They get haircuts instead of 
hairstyles. In response to marketing sizzle, they're always asking 
"Where's the beeP" Their instinctive response to the game of runaway 
consumerism is to stop playing and go boil some potatoes, 
High-openness consumers are also much mOre profitable because 
they are early adopters and fashion followers, They use the 
of 
goods and services to display their openness, Their openness is cru-
Cial to consumerism, because it drives novelty seeking, fads, and fash-
ions, This was the great insight of Brooks Stevens, who developed the 
concept of planned obsolescence after World War It He noted that 
businesses can make a lot more money if they continually introduce 
new product innovations that exploit some consumers' desires to "own 
something a little newer and a little better, a little sOOner than neces-
sarr" The products he designed- Lawn-Boy lawn mowers, Evinrude 
outboard motors, Harley-Davidson Hydra elide motorcycles-touted 
minor technical improvements as status necessities for the modern, 
progress-oriented consumer of the 1950s. They appealed to the highly 
open: the YOllng, hip, and urban, 
Planned obsolescence was 
to the golden age of industrial 
deSign, from 
1930s through the 1970s, Every )'ear brought new 
products with avant-garde styling that rendered last year's model 
conspicuously old-fashioned, I\s Vance Packard observed, it is impos-
sible to make genuine technical innovations in established products 
every year, so their planned obsolescence must be focused on design, 
not functionality, Businesses must seek "planned obsolescence of 
desirability" (the prodllct is thrown Ollt and replaced because it is DO 
longer fashionable), rather than "planned obsolescence of utility" (the 

224 
S PEN T 
product is thrown out because it no longer works). Stevens's insight 
spread quickly through all domains of industrial design: cars, houses, 
clothing, furniture. Business learned that COnSumers bought things 
vastly more often if they were convinced that product novelty as an 
openness indicator trumped product utility and reliability as consci-
entiousness indicators. So, throughout these decades of dizzying aes-
thetic innovation, the highly open were highly excited, and the less 
open were higllly confused.

Conscientiousness 
Co 1': serE NTIOUSNESS IS the Big Five personality trait that includes 
such characteristics as integrity, reliability, predictability, consistency, 
and punctuality. It predicts respect for social norms and responsibili-
ties, and the likelihood of fulfilling promises and contracts. A century 
ago, people would have called it character. principle, honor, or moral 
fiber. It is, primarily, the inhibitory self·control imposed by the fromal 
lobes on the more impulsive. short-term, selfish instincts of the lim-
bic system. Nowadays marketers appeal to impulsive youth by fram· 
ing older-adult conscientiousness as rigidity, archaism, inrubition, and 
uncoalness. In a sonse, they are right, for there is a trade-off. Consci· 
cntiousness IS lower on average in juveniles, and as it matures slowly 
"ith age, it tends to inhibit spontaneity, fun, and romance-which is 
to say, it inhibits the short-term mating that tends to maximize repro-
ductive success among young males and that tends to leave young 
remales pregnant and Single. 
Traditionally, low conscientiousness wont by many names: unre' 
liable, undependable, impulsive, flak}'; criminal. bum, malcontent, 
ne'er-do-well, revolutionary. Since powerful elites prefer reliable 
pcasants, and workers, the general thrust of civilization is to domes-
ticate the young, wild, and impulsive into the mature, conSCientious, 
:md hardworking. The colonialist slave owner increases the slave's 
"onsdentiousness through whipping to "get his head right." The 
industrial-era schoolteacher increases the working-class studem's 
<,ol1scientiousness through demanding regular attendance, recitation, 
;II,d homework. The elite traditionally socializes its own youth toward 
higher conscientiousness through boarding school, military service,

conscientiousness is an unusual personality 
trail. Because hunter-gatherer life did not require as much planning 
and memory for debts and duties as life in larger-scale societies with 
more complex divisions of labor, conscientiousness may have evolved 
to higher average levels only recently, and perhaps to a greater c!POT"f" 
in some populations than others. Only with the rise of activities like 
agriculture and animal herding would our ancestors have needed 
sort of anxious obsessiveness and future-mindedness that character-
ize the highly conscientious. Only in the past ten thousand years did 
our ancestors prosper by continually asking themselves: 
I plowed 
enough 
Did i sow the seeds early enough? Is one of the lambs 
missing' Did roy cousin pay me for those olives? Am I teaching my 
children the skills they will need in twenty years) Thus were born the 
sleepless predawn ruminations of the middle-aged conscientious. 
For most of adulthood, then, people strive to present a public 
facade of high conscientiousness-the extreme of the trait dimension 
most often favored by educators, employers, co-workers, doctors, tax 
collectors, loan sharb, spouses, children, 
crops, and 
domesticated animals. The modern consumerist market obliges by 
providing a plethora of goods, services, and activities that can function 
as conscientiousness indicators. 
High·Maintenance Products 
Traditional economics assumes that consumers try to maximize their 
ease and leisure. People should accordingly prefer products that require 
minimal care, maintenance, and repair. Yet such products make very 
poor conscientiousness indicators. Much better to buy perishable pet 
fish, stainable light-colored clothes, furniture ,,~th dust-catching orna' 
mentation, cars with glossy paint jobs, and expanSive, water-thirsty 
lawns. \'v'hy? Because those low in conscientiousness will not maintain

forget, or their servants will forget, and the appearance of their posses' 
sions will suffer. 
This principle-that some people actually prefer products that 
require some regular maintenance, so they can show off their con-
scientiousness--often goes unnoticed by economists and unexploited 
by marketers. Like so much of costly Signaling theory, it doesn't make 
rational sense at first glance. True, any 
consumer would prefer to 
minimize the time and energy he must invest in any given personality 
display, including any conscientiousness display: he will seek instead 
shortcuts and time-savers. But at the aggregate level of social signal, 
ing, products that become too easy to maintain will lose their value 
as conscientiousness indicators. They will lose status and reputability. 
They will be bought and displayed less often hy those keen to appear 
conscientious. For example, solid oak flooring remains more reputa-
ble than faux-wood plastic laminate flooring, in part because the oak 
requires daily spill wiping, monthly mopping with Murphy Oil Soap, 
and periodic refinishing with power sanders that make so much noise 
and vibration that all your tropical fish die from stress. (Again, there 
are ubiquitous trade-offs between different signaling tactics.) Also, as 
new technologies and design innovations have made it easier to clean 
and maimain each square foot of household, we keep increasing the 
total square footage of each house, to maintain a reputably onerous 
total quantity of housework. 
This drive to acquire conscientiousness indicators results in a 
sort of "conservation of maintenance" principle in most product cat· 
eg(lfies. The modern American megakitchen is a prime example. A 
major kitchen remodeling job now costs more than $ 50,000 on aver' 
age, 
to cover the expense of exotic countertop materials, cus· 
tom 
and high-end appliances. The two-career couples who 
can afford such kitchens rarely have time to use them for cooking, but 
they wish to demonstrate that they are the kind of conscientious din' 
ncr hosts and parents who CQuld, in pdnciple, bake homemade cook-

require high maintenance, but through tbose that are conspicuously Frag-

untorn lingerie, or, as we shall see next, a menagerie of finicky-yet-

Pets as Conscientiousness Indicators 
Chattels that require regular care make excellent conscientiousness 
indicators, and the pet industry is a prime source of them. Consider 
the home aquarium for tropical fish, To maintain a modest twenty-
gallon freshwater aquarium for a few gouramis, rashoros, and tctms,

Where genuine organisms are too expensive and space consuming

schoolgirls have proliferated into Micro-Babies, Neopets, Nano Pals, 
Puka·Puka Water Angels, and Zudes. Most require an absurdly high 
level of maintenance through the clicking of various buttons every few 
bours. Yet that is precisely the point: their maddening propensity to

There may have been a positive-feedback loop between the domes-
tication of other species and the evolution of human conscientiousness. 
New research suggests that humans have been shaping the evolution 
of plants and animals for at least fifty thousand years through various 
"pre·domestication" processes, and that domestication proper began at 
least eleven thousand years ago. The cognitive and emotional demands 
of tending to other species may have shaped the evolution of conscien-
tiousness as a personality 
driving the human averuge higher than 
that found in other social primates. Most species that do "ecosystem 
engineering" and "ruche construction"-creating their own ecological 
niches by shaping the environment-seem to evolve higher conscien' 
tiousness. Beavers raise successful falrulies by building dams that ere· 
ate small lakes where none existed before, and they show quite a work 
ethic while doing so. The same selection pressures that favored higher 
eonscientj.ousness mal' have set the st,1.ge for the great advances in 
human domestication around ten thousand years ago: dogs (for protec-
tion and huntmgl, goats, sheep, cattle, bottle gourds (for containers), 
figs, bananas. wheat, 
maize, millet, sunflowers, squash, manioc, 
and arrowroot. Each demands a different kind of care, a learned set 
of cross-species empathies that require a foundation of conscien-
tiousness. Such eonscientiousness has becn well worth acivertisin"

to potential mates and friends for many millennia. If we can't display 
conscientiousness through pride in a herd of healthy goats, we buy 
Puka·Puka Water Angels instead. As rohots become more popular, 
expect consumers to prefer those that require some degree of care and 
maintenance-some credible conscientiousness dispJays--over tbose 
that are entirely autonomous. This is why empathy-eliciting toy robots 
such as FlUby, Roboraptor, AlBO, and Plea sell better than solar· 
powered robot Ia"m mowers. 
Conecting 
High conscientiousness shades over into obsessive·compulsive behav· 
ior. Among consumers, this often takes the form of collecting-
acquiring large numbers 
produclS within a particular category, plus 
the expertise to discuss 
intelligently with like· minded collectors. 
Collections "express one's identity"-as William James wrote in 1890, 
"]\ man's Self is the sum total of all that he can call his." However, the 
act of collecting does not express all the Central Six traits equally. A 
high, even toxic, level of conscientiousness is foremost in the resource· 
fill acquisition, ordered display, 
habitual care of one's coJlection. 
Runaway collecting is the apotheosis of runaway consumetism. \Vith 
the eBay "collectibles" section, everyone can now participate in hoard· 
ing and fetishizing objects across most imaginable categories: Ilrefight· 
iog memorabilia, Desert Storm militaria, Disneyana, Pez dispensers, 
snow globes, Bujfr the Vampire Slayer f.gurines, nautical decor, replica 
movie swords, vintage pet·food ads, vintage flue covers, and "risque" 
postcards. 
Yet one person's obsessive hoarding is another person's rational 
investment strategy, or his acquiSition of tools and materials required 
for some enthusiasm. I contemplate the t",'enty'seven hundred pairs 
of shoes that Imelda Marcos collected in the Ma[acaiiang Palace, and 
feel moral outrage for the poor of the Philippines. r contemplate the 
"omparable number of used books that I have bought, and feel like a 
dullful researcher. We can all rationalize our cabinets of curiosities.

Personal Grooming 
The "personal-care sector" or beauty industry is often misunderstood 
as Just a set of products for enhancing physical attractiveness. How, 
ever, many of its facets make more sense if viewed as conscientiousness 
indicators. 
Consider what we do with our head hair. Humans are unusual 
among mammals in sporting head hair that grows conrinuously for 
about five years, before d.ropping out. Left uncut, it grows about waist 
long. Genetic evidence suggests that this innovation evolved about 
240,000 years ago. Some have argued that continuously growing head 
hair evolved as a reHable signal of one's ability to groom oneself and 
to solicit grooming from others. Contrary to the stereotype of messy-
headed cavemen promoted by early museum depictions, i1 is likely that 
ancestral humans, like all self, respecting mammals, groomed their 
hair avidly into diverse styles. 
Fashionable hairstyles vary dramatically across history and cui,. 
cure, but they tend to have one Common denominator: they requir~.i 
inlensive maintenance, whether through regular shaving, CIJlting,l 
1 
trimming, washing, conditioning, styling, braiding, teasing, gelling,:1 
dyeing, powdering, or decorating. The Marine Corps drill sergeant; 
must get his hair cut once a week to maintain the close-shaven macho ~ 
look. The long-tressed cheerleader must condition, brush, and st)'le.; 
her hair daily. The male business executive must shave his face everllj 
morITing, or fisk being mistaken for one of the more "creative types" in" 
marketing. Stubble is acceptable only for backroom financial analyst' 
interns working eighty-hour weeks at investment banks, or CIA agents 
returning to the office from fieldwork in third,world countries. Like-
wise, the female husiness executive must shave her legs every few days, 
to reassure male co-workers that she submits to the professional-yet-
feminine gender role and harbors no secret tendencies toward lesbian-
ism or socialism. The matted dreadlocks that naturally form jf human

who have heen ostracized, or who have opted out from mainstream 
social responsibilities: drunks, stoners, street people, schizophrenics, 
the shipwrecked By contrast, well,kept dreadlocks (think mid-1990s 
Ani DiFranco) can function as mdicators of high conscientiousness 
at a different level: their wearers conspicuously avoid hairstyles that 
require regular use of alkyl sulfates in shampoos and high volumes of 
shower water. Grooming fashions and products come and go, because 
there are so very many ways for humans to impose onerous groom' 
ing regimens on themselves. Yet beneath all the variation across time, 
place, and subculture, the instinct to advertise one's conscientiousness 
motivates much of this personal care. 
The Unused Exercise Machine 
The home fitness industry comprises one of the most profligate wastes 
of machinery in human history. We pay thousands of dollars for finely 
crafted running machines, elliptica.l trainers, and weights. Some of 
uS even buy the Endless Pool, an eight-by-fifteen-foot freestanding 
"treadmill for swimmers" that produces an adjustable head current, for 
just $20,400 plus accessories. 
These machines were typically purchased with the firm self-
improvement convictions of a New Year's resolution or a recent divorce: 
rrom now on, we will exercise thrice weekly, lose thirty pounds, and 
maintain a lean, healthy form well into retirement. Vk use the machines 
with jiggly,lardish enthusiasm for several weeks, prattling to our mends 
and co-workers about feeling rejuvenated. But grndually, dismptions 
"CCUT. We get a cold, take a trip, suffer a knee injury Excuses for sloth 
arise. The frequency of exercise becomes irregular, then lower, then zero. 
We watch American Gladiator (vicarious exercise, at least) whjle finish-

All experienced fitness machine salespeople are well aware that 
this is the fate of most of their products. "Vhar they are really selling 
consumers is the delusion that the sunk costs of buying the machines 
will force them to exercise conscientiously. (The consumers know that 
they could have already been jogging for months around their neigh-
borhood parks in their old running shoes, but they also know that their 
access to the parks and shoes has not, empirically, been sufficient to 
induce regular exercise.) So, the consumer thinks: "If I invest $3,900 
in this PreCor EFX5.33 elliptical trainer, it wiU (1) call forth regular 
aerobic actrvit)' from my flawed and uw.vorth), body, through the techno-
fetishistic magic of its build quality, and (2) save me money in the long 
run hy reducing medical exl,enses." The salesperson meanwhile thinks: 
"20 percent commissim,I" and the manufacturer thinks: "1,ve can safely 
afTer a ten-year warranty; because the average machin" only gets used sev-
enteetl times in the first two months after purchese." Everybody's happy, 
except for most consumers, and they don't complain because they 
think it's all their fault that they're failing to use the machine. The few 
conscientious consumers who do use the equipment regularly enjoy 
many benefits: efficient muscle building and fat burning through the 
low perceived exertion of the PreCor's smooth elliptical movement; a 
lean body that elicits lust and respect; a self-satisfied glow of moral 
superiority. 
Thus, home fitness machines make excellent conscientiousness 
indicators, as they can increase fitness only when used by the highly 
conscientious; for everyone else, they just gather dust. The result is 
that, given modern sedentary jobs and overlarge food portions, the only 
people who can stay in shape throughout their twenties and thirties 
are the highly conscientious. Everyone else bloats. So, under modern 
conditions, a lean body testifies not just to the person's heritable body 
type, but to their heritable conscientiousness, and hence their matu-
rity and reliability as a friend, mate, or co-worker. We infer that if their 
capacity for guilt and foresight can drive them to regular exercise, it 
might protect us from being exploited or abandoned by them.

"exergaming"--computer games that combine on-screen action with 
physical exercise. The arcade game Dance Dance Revolution (invented 
in 1998 by Konami) requires players to activate electronic floor sensors 
with their feet in fast, complex patterns corresponding to dance steps. 
Similarly, in MoCap Boxing (2001), players shadow-box against an on-
screen opponent, with their moves registered through infra-red motion 
capture ("mocap") sensors. The Nintendo \Vii system brings such exer-
gaming into the home. Its remote, which includes accelerometers and 
an infrared detection system for sensing 3-D location, allows users to 
play more than five hundred games based on physical activities, sllch 
as tennis, baseball, cheerleading, kart racing, cake making, and bal-
loon popping, not to mention more speculative possibilities such as 
chicken shooting, elf bowling, ghostbusting, and God7jlla fighting. 
These three game systems are not only aerobically demanding but fun 
to the point of addictiveness and mass popularity, thus threatening 
to undercut the traditional correlation between conscientiousness and 
regular use of exercise machines. 
The Credit Rating 
Tn our credit-based economy, a high credit rating functions as a sort 
of conscientiollsness meta-indicator. It is not directly accessible to or 
perceivable by observers. but it is the basis of so much of our purchas-
ing power that a middle-class lifestyle is almost impossible without it. 
\,vithout good credit, most people cannot acquire a car or house. Thus, 
individua1s who own a decent ear and house are inrurecdy demonstrat-
ing their reputable crecii[ score, and hence their conscientiousness. 
At least in the United States and United Kingdom, FICO credit 
ratings from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion can range from about 
300 (very bad) to about 850 (very good). Consider the factors that con-
lribute to a high credit rating: Having a longer credit history (that is, 
being older). Paying bills on time. Sending small amounts of money 
vcry regularly to credit card companies, so their interest profits are 
l1lilximizcd. Not d,{alliling on loans or going IlHnknlpt. Living at the 

236 
S PEN T 
same address for many months. Having some debt, but not too 
in proportion to one's income. Checking one's credit report 
six 
months for errors (which often arise), and demonstrating the patience 
to call the credit scoring agency to fix the error. Not having a lot of 
recent credit score inqu iries. This aU sounds very straightforward to 
the highJy conscientious. But to average folks, it really is very hard to 
acbjeve, which is why the average credit score is around 680-well 
below the 720+ level for getting the lowest interest rates on credit 
cards and mortgages. 
Now, consider all 
fun, impulsive, wild, crazy behaviors that can 
nuke one's credit score. College students, unfamiliar with the concept 
that loans must be repaid, tend to incur large debts. Alcoholism and 
drug addiCtion tend to cost a lot, create excess debt. result in eviction 
(frequent changes of address), and interfere with regular bill payjng. 
Several mental disorders (bipolar disorder, borderiine personality dis-
order, attention-deficit disorder, psychopathy) undermine credit SCOres 
by driving impulsive behaviors-shopping sprees, sudden changes of 
job and residence, drug binges and suicidal gestures that incur high 
hospital bills, reckless driving that incurs high car-repair bills, sexual 
affairs that require romantic gift-giving, jail terms that reduce income. 
It is practically impossible for a man with mania, or a woman with bor-
derline, to maintain an above-average credit score. (On the other hand, 
a touch of obsessive-compulsive disorder. directed toward one's finan-
cial behavior, can increase both one's credit score and one's reliability 
as a social Or sexual partner.). In each case-youth, drug addiction, 
mental disorder-the same impulsiveness that would interfere with 
having reliable social. or sexual relationships also undermines one's 
credit score. This is why potential friends and mates have incentives 
to pay attention to one's credit score, albeit indirectly, as it is manifest 
through one's ability to acquire costly, credit-demanding products. 
Strangely, personality psychologists seem not to have investigated 
the correlation between conscientiousness (as measured by standard 
personality tests) and FlCO credit ratings (as calculated by 
rating 
agencies). Presumably confidentiality issues are involved, but therc arc 
Conscientiousness

also political ones. Personality psychologists know that conscientious-
ness is a bask, stable, heritable trait. If they showed that it strongly 
predicts credit ratings, then the credit ratings would start looking 
less like measures of mystical willpower, and more like measures of 
brain function. Conversely, variation in average credit ratings across 
sex, age, race, ethnicity, religion, and social class would raise awk-
ward questions about differences in average conscientiousness across 
these groups. Tbus, it is ideologically useful to ignore the causal links 
between genes, brains, conscientiousness, credit scores, spending abil-
ity, and conspicuous consumption~ 
Formal Education and Employment 
lawns, hairstyles, and credit scores are all very well, but so far we 
have ignored the alpha and omega of conscientiousness indicators: hav-
ing a good education and a reputable job. These, like tbe credit score, 
function as meta-indicators. We cannot buy a genuine education or a 
stable employment history directly, but it is very hard to achieve either 
without decent conscientiousness. Thus, school 
work, tbrough the 
regular income they yield, allow the purchase of many other products 
as ind irect conscientiousness indicators, 
As all factory foremen and parole officers know, it is extremely dif-
ficult for someone of low conscientiousness to hold down a regular 
job in the modem economy. Woody j\'llen observed that 90 percent of 
success is just shOWing up. The unconscientious, in contrast, show up 
late for work or do not show up at alL \"ihen they do show up, they for-
get what they're supposed to be doing, make costly errors, don't follow 
safety protocols, endanger their co·workers, neglect their customers, 
and annoy their bosses. lacking the conscience and social inhibitions 
of other workers, they tend to steal tools and supplies. wreck com-
pany vehicles, and take unscheduled holidays. In short, they are more 
trouble than they are worth. A person of limited intelligence but hlgh 
conscientiousness can make a valuable employee; a person of higher 
intelligence but vC'ty low conscientiousness is almost unemployable.

Educated professionals (like most readers of this book) are largely 
insulated from such low, conscientiousness fiascos on the job, be,eallse 
their support personnel are prescreencd for a decent level of consci-
entiousness. It is when they tTl' to find good babysitters, gardeners, 
car mechanics, and building contractors that the true range of consci-
entiousness in the general population becomes manifest. For exam-
ple, the most difficult thing about remodeling a house is dealing wilh 
general cOntractors who do not return phone calls, speCialist Contrac-
tors who do not show up, and suppliers who do not deliver. After six 
months of such behavior, most homeowners have a little less respect 
for people who look fun and cool, and a little more respect for people 
who are consistent and diligent. 
There are class differences in how ooe's work life displays one's 
conSCientiousness. Working-class hourly employees who must punch 
time docks show their cooscienttousness through reliability of atten-
regularity of work hours, and quantified consistency of job per-
formance (for 
a low rate of assembly-line errors or forgotten 
entree orders). MiddJe-c1ass salaried workers show conscientiousness 
through having completed some consistency-demanding formal edu-
cation and by completing specific tasks on time for their Ime man-
ager. The self-employed, the small-business owners, and the creative 
(writers, artists, marketing consultants) have an especially acute 
chaUenge: demonstrating conscientiousness through long periods of 
diligent work, unrein forced by bosses, social pr~.ssures, or sharp dead-
lines. The freelance science journalist, comer-shop grocer, and prolific 
genre novelist have this in common: if they are making a viable living 
doing their job, they must have high conscientiousness. In fact, at the 
highest levels of self-directed achievement, 
tend to seek out 
minimally structured jobs almost as a self-handicapping way to show 
extreme diligence. The tenured professor has 
external incen-
tives to remain an interesting teacher and productive

she does, it speaks especially dearly of her intrinsic dutifulness,

desire to display his diligence optimally. Yet many professionals seem 
to seek out uncierstfUctnred jobs, and join professional guilds such as 
bar associations and medical associations that lobby for minimal over-
sight. They do this not because they are un conscientious slackers, but 
because they seek the extra challenge of remaining productive despite 
the temptations to loaf Thus, the highest-status professions are those 
in which 
conSCIentiousness is required for long-term career 
success, 
in which there are minimal sticks, carrots, and bosses to 
motivate 
performance. This applies even to celebrity roles 
thallook easy to outsiders, Most successful actors must endure hun, 
dred, 
auditions before making their name. Professional ath-
letes must spend years training from childhood onward. Aspiring US 
presidents must campaign for two solid years before elections. 
School. work, and credit-three pillars of consumer capitalism-
are also, not coincidentally, the most reli<Ible and conspicuous mcii-
cators of conscientiousness, All other consumer purchaSing depends 
on these three pillars, so they are fundamental to conspicuous con-
swnption.

Agreeableness 
AGREEABLENESS [5 "OT Just one of the Big Five personality traits. 
Construed more broadly as a personal capacity for empathy, kindness, 
and benevolence, and as a desire for egalit.arianism and socia! justice, 
agreeableness is at the heart of human altruism and social progressiv-
ism. It is the rare product of natural selection and sexual selection that 
makes Oill species seem to transcend the otherwise selfish imperatives 
of the evolutionary process. It is our last, best hope for the salvation 
of our species, but also our most persistent SOUIce of hypocrisy and 
runaway self-righteousness. And we advertise agreeableness in such 
diverse and subtle ways, through such complex and intangible prod-
ucts, that we often do not realize we are Signaling it at all. 
The Agreeable Economy 
Economies are driven by this trait at several levels : by high-agreeableness 
consmners striving to display their kindness and generosity, and by low-
agreeableness consumers striving to display their assertiveness and 
dominance. 
At the macro level, ritualized occasions for gift giving to mates, 
friends, or relatives promote a huge proportion of retail sales. Most 
retailers would go bankrupt quickly if their culture did not celebrate 
some subset of calendar holidays (Christmas, Boxing Day, New Year's 
Day, Fasching, Valentine's Day, Easter, Vesak, Mother's Day, Father's 
Day, summer holidays, Ramadan, Labor Day, Oktoberfest, Diwali, 
Halloween, Thanksgiving, Chanukah, and so on), family remem-
brances (birthdays, anniversaries), and rites of passage (bar mitzvahs, 
graduations, marriages, honeymoons, baby showers, retirements, funer-

als). These all depend on the agreeable signaling their agreeableness 
by giving gifts or feasts to the grateful. 
At the micro level, many products thrive because they are asso-
ciated with agreeable personalities and acti"ities. Since the 1930s 
diamond engagement rings have been the premier symbol of roman-
tically honorable intentions and likely spousal agreeableness. Early 
Q,ventieth-century women faced a problem: prosecution of men for 
financial damages following breach of promise was declining. It was 
becoming all too common to be seduced by a psychopath promising 
marriage and then abandoned after he availed himself of one's virgin-
ity during the engagement. Into this reliable-signaling gap jumped De 
Beers with the diamond ring, heavily promoted with the slogan "A 
diamond is forever." Diamond marketers recommended that \-vomen 
ask men to spend two months' salary (or about a year's disposable 
income) on a ring, as a sign of the seriousness of their commitment. 
Ever since, engagement rings have dominated the demand for dia-
monds larger than one carat. Every time men found a cheaper source 
of diamonds, women demanded larger ones to maintain the signaling 
reliability. Now, aspiring grooms are stampeding from retail jewelry 
stores to online stores such as Blue Nile that charge 40 percent less 
for the same ring. Nonetheless, their fiancees, who typically pick their 
favored ring design from Blue Nile themselves, still expect the man 
to follow the two-months'-sa!ary rule (yielding an average engagement 
ring price of $6,400). The onUne sa'~ngs is converted into a larger dia-
mond, not into a smaller cost, because a smaller cost would represent 
a less-reliable signal of agreeableness. 
Many sen~ces are also marketed as amplifiers of agreeableness. 
'I'hese usually teach "etiquette," that is, how to emulate the taCIt social 
norms of the local ruling class. Sucb norms usually require practic-
ing superhuman levels of patience, discretion, generosity, and sympa-
Ihy; the implicit goal is to demonstrate that one's prefrontal cortex can 
maintain tight inhibitory control over selfish or impulsive behaviors.

Indicators of Agreeableness Versus Aggressiveness 
As all marketers koow, there is gold in the eighteen-to-thirty,four-
year-old male demographic group, Young aduJr males invest rar more 
time, energy, and money in maring effort than in parenting effort, 
and mating effort yields the mOst profitable products, Depending 
on their current mating tacrics and rivals, young males switch oFten 
between displaying low agreeableness and displaying high agreeable-
ness, When a young male is trying to impress a female initially with 
his genetal mate value, social dominance, maturity, and manliness, or 
trying to deter male sc'<ual ri\'als ftom hitting on the chosen female, 
he must display low agreeableness: a risk-taking, violent assertiveness 
bordering on psychopathy, On the other hand, once a relationship is 
established, the )'oung male must display high agreeableness to 
nal 
potential as a long-term mate: romantic thoughtfulness to the 
women, gentleness to children and animals, concern for the environ-
social justice, and family values, This may be why popular music 
played by you ng males alternates shamelessly between fast, heavy, 
aJ<gr€:sSJive anthems (to excite ovulating groupies and intimidate male 
rivals), and slow, soft, romantic ballads (to reassure the highest-quality 
female girlfriends that the males will be forever chaste and loving), 
This may also he why males tend to switch from assertiveness dIS-
plays in young adulthood to agreeableness displays in middle age, For

Twenty years later, after their testosterone levels decline to reduce 
their mating effort, the same males who sought the Boss Hoss or Glock 
roadster will mostly be settled down, and understand that their \hives 
and kids value agreeableness more than aggressiveness. They ,,'iil find 
themselves behind the wheel of a large Toyota Camry hybrid, They 
will consult the American Anti-Vi\'iseetion Sodety Guide to CO'nt'

Displaying Agreeableness Through Conformity 
Highly agreeable people want to get along with everyone, so they tend 
to be conformists, whether 'A'ith respect to peer'group opinions, fash, 
ions, or product choices. Conversely, anticonformity cao signal domi-
nance, assertiveness, and low agreeableness. 
To test the idea that people use conformity strategically to signal; 
agreeableness, Vladas Griskevidus and his colleagues ran another 
"mating prime" study, They expected a sex difference, because women 
have a stronger preference than men do for mates who display asser-
tiveness, dominance, leadership, and risk takinK So, mating-primed 
males may try to display these lower,agreeableness traits through 
conspicuous anticonformity-by resisting and rebelljng against peer· 
influence. On the other hand, mating-primed females may try to 
display their higher-agreeableness traits (kindness, empathy, social-
networking ability) through conspicuous conformity to peer influence, 
Subjects were randomly assigned to one 
three priming condi-
tions. In the mating'prime condition, they read a romantically arous-
ing story about being on a vacation with friends, meeting and spending 
the day with a highly desirable person of the opposite sex, and kissing 
passionately on a moonlit beach, In the "threat prime," they read a 
frightening story about an intruder breaking and entering when they 
were home alone at night. In the "neutral prime," they read a happy 
Afjreeableness 
245 
story about going to a much'anticipated live music event with a same-
sex friend, After experiencing one of these primes, the subjects were 
shown various artistic images, They were told that all three of their 
peers gave either positive or negative ratings to each of the 
and 
then they gave their own ratings. Their le"el of agreement with the 
peers indicated their degree of conformity. 
As predlcted, GriskevicillS found that mating-primed men showed 
less conformity than in the threat or neutral conditions, whereas 
mating-primed women showed more conformity. These mating-prime 
effects were modulated in a fascinating way by the direction of the 
peer evaluations, If all the peers rated a particular artistic 
posi, 
tively, mating'primed men showed neither conformity nor anticonfor, 
mill'; they just followed their previously measured aesthetic tastes, 
But if all the peers rated a particular artistic 
negatively, mating, 
primed men showed strong anticonformity (and thus hlgher openness) 
by rating the image much more positively, However, mating-primed 
women showed stronger conformity if all their female peers rated the 
artistic image positively, and neither conformity nor anticonformity 
if their peers rated the image negativel),. It looks as though each sex 
wants to act "positive" in their aesthetic ratings, but the males prefer 
to act positive most strongly when all the other males act negative, 
whereas the females prefer to act positive most strongly when all the 
other females are also positive. Conformity interacts with positivity in 
the strategic signaling of this personality trail. (By contrast, the threat 
prime concerning the home intruder led both sexes equally to show 
higher conformit), in their ratings of the artistic images, as jf a self, 
protection motive were favoring group-miodedness,) 
In a follow-up study, Griskevicius discovered a further nuance in 
human self-presentation: 
sex·specific effects of the mating prime 
on conformity are inAuenced by whether a person's judgment can, 
('ems subjective taste or objective fact. lvlating'primed males show 
('specially strong nonconformity when they make subjective judg-
ments about which consumer product they would prefer (3 Mercedes 
or BMW luxury car, a Fem\ri or Lamborghini sports car), hilt they

switch to showing very high conformity wtlen they are asked objec-, 
live knowledge questions (is it more expensive to live in New York OC 
San Francisco? \<Vhich airline has more on-time arrivals, Southwest

On peer opinion to avoid faclual errors, On

Ideology as an Agreeableness Indicator 
Young adults of both sexes often devote massive amounts of time, 
money, and energy to signaling their agreeableness through their ide", 
ologies, For example, at Columbia University in 1986, there was a sud·, 
den upsurge of conspicuous agreeableness one spring, Hundreds of' 
college students took over the campus administration building and 
demanded that the university sell off all its stocks in companies thaI 
do business in South Africa. (This was in the days or apartheid, when

,\1elson Nlandela was still in jail and blacks could not vote.) The spon-
taneity, ardor, and near-unanimity of the student demands for divest-
ment seemed puzzlinK Why would mostly white, mostly middle-class 
North Americans miss classes, risk jail, and occupy a drab office 
building for two weeks in support of political freedom for poor black 
strangers living in a cOllntry eight thousand miles away? The cam-
pus conservative newspaper ran a cartoon depicting the protest as an 
annual springtime mating ritual, with Dionysian revels punctuated by 
political sloganeering abollt this year's arbitrary cause, The cartoon 
seemed patronizing at first, but later it seemed to contain a grain of 
truth. Although the protests achieved their political aims, only inef-
ficiently and indirectly, they did promote very efficient mating among 
young men and women who claimed to share similar political ideolo-
gies, Everyone seemed to be dating someone th"}/d met at the sit-in. 
In many cases, the ideological commitment was paper-thin, and the 
protest ended just in time for the students to study for semester exams, 
Yet the sexual relationships facilitated by the protest lasted for years in 
some cases. 
It seems cynical and dangerous to suggest that loud public dis-
plays of one's political ideology function as some sort of courtship 
ritual designed to attract sexual mates, for it risks trivializing political 
discourse, just as the conservative cartoon did when lampooning the 
Columbia antiapartheid protests, The best way to avoid this pitfall is 
nOr to ignore the costly signaling logic of human political behavior, 
but to analyze it seriously and respectfully as a dramatic example of 
personality display, 
Humans are ideological animals. 'We show strong motivations and 
,'apacities to learn, create, recombine, and disseminate value-laden idea 
systems, often with a righteous contempt for any empirical evidence 
that would undermine them, Yet it has always seemed hard to envision a 
survival payoff for conspicuous ideologies that scoff at empirical reahtr 
I,'ortunately, costly signaling theory does not demand survival payoffs, 
only sodal and reproductive payoffs, If a l'Oospicuously displayed ideal·

socially and sexuaHy desired, then the ideology's empirical truth is irrel-
evant. Indeed, the most empirically misleading and self-handicapping 
ideologies might often make the most reI iable personality indicators. 
The vast majority of people in modern societies have little political 
power, yet they do have strong political convictions that they broad-
cast insistently, frequently, and loudly when social conditions are 
right (political protests, dinner parties, second dates)_ This behavior. 
is pu«ling to economists, who regard any ideological behavior--even 
voting-as an expenditure of time and energy that has little political 
benefit for the individuaL But if we view the individual benefits of 
expressing political ideology as usually not political at all, but rather 
as social and sexual, we can shed light on a number of old puzz.les 
in political psychology. Why do hundreds of questionnaires show that. 
men are, on average~ more conservatl",'e, more authoritarian. more i 
rights oriented, and less empathy oriented than women? Why do pea- : 
1 
pie usually become more conservative as they move from young adult.: 
hood to middle age? Why do more men than women run for political 
office? Why are most ideological revolutions initiated by young single· 
men? 
None of these phenomena make sense if political ideology is inter, 
preted as a rational reflection of political self-interest. In political, ceo' 
nomic, evolutionary, and psychological terms, everyone has equal! 
strong self-interests, sO everyone should engage in equal amounts 0 
ideological behavior, if that behavior functions to advance politic 
self-interest. However. we know from sexual selection theory that no 
everyone has equally strong reproductive interests. Males have muclt'· 
more to gain from many acts of intercourse with multiple partner. 
than do females, because males can potentially produce offspring by 
hundreds or thousands of different women, but women can bear only 1 
about a dozen offspring in a lifetime. Young males should consequent I)" 
be especially risk seeking in their reproductive behavior, because they 
have the most to win and the least to lose from risky courtship behav-
ior (such as becoming a political revolutionary), 
predictions are 
obvious to anj' sexual selection theorist; less ohvious arc the wilys in 
Agreeableness 
249 
which political ideology is used to advertise different aspects of one's 
personality across the life span. 
Adults, especially when young, tend to treat one another's politi-
cal orientations as proxies for personality traits. Conservatism is read 
as indicating an ambitious, self-interested personality that will excel 
at protecting and provisioning a sexual partner. Liberalism is read as 
indicating a caring, empathetic personality that will excel at child care 
and relationship building. Given the well-documented, cross-culturally 
universal sex difference in human mate choke criteria, with men 
favoring 
fertile women, and women favoring older, higher-
status, richer men, the expression of more-liberal ideologies by women 
and more conservative ideologies by men is not surprising. Men use 
political conservatism to (unconsciously) advertise their likely social 
and economic dominance; women use political liberalism to advertise 
their nurturing abilities. The shift from liberal youth to conservative 
middle age reflects a mating-relevant increase in social dominance 
and earning power, not just a rational shift in one's self-interes!. 
More subtly, because mating is a social game in which the attrac' 
tiveness of a behavior depends on how many other people are already 
producing that beh.avior, political ideology evolves under the unstable 
dynamics of social lmitation and strategizing. not just as a process 
of simple optimiZation, given a particular set of self-interests. This 
explains why an entire 
body at an American university can 
suddenly act as if it 
deeply about the political fate of a country 
that it virtually ignored the year before, The consensually accepted 
way to display agreeableness simply shifted, capriciously and quickly, 
from one political issue to another. Once a sufficient number of stu-
dents decided that attitudes toward apartheid were the acid test for 
whether one's heart was in the right place, it became impossible for 
'!Ilyone else to be apathetic about apartheid. 
Wbat can we do to improve society if most people treat political 
i<it'as as courtship displays that reveal their advocates' personality 
I raits, rather than as rational suggestions for improving the world? The 
IlCIlgmal k, not to ""y cynical, solution is to work v.'th the evolved grain 

250 
SPENT 
of the human mind by recognizing that people respond to policy ideas 
not just as concerned citizens in a modem polity, but also as hyperso-
cia!. status-seeking primates. This view will not surprise political mar-
keters (pollsters, spin doctors, speechwriters), who make thcir living 
by exploiting OUf lust for ideology, but it may surprise social scientists 
who take a more rationalistic view of human nature. Nonetheless, to 
understand a great deal of consumer behavior, we have to acknowl· 
edge the fundamentally ideological nature of many purchasing deci-
sions, and the way that everyone uses products, in various ways, to 
advertise his or her personality traits. 
The Religious and Political Service Industries 
as Personality Indicators 
In cosmopolitan societies, even religious and political ideologies are 
marketed as perSonaliry indicators, especially as indicators of agree' 
ableness or assertiveness. The religious services industry today is a 
trillion· dollar global business; the Catholic Church in the United 
States alone takes in more than $100 billion in revenue per year. Reli-
gion used to be a set of local monopolies segregated by ethnic;ty, cui· 
ture, and language, but over time, rituals, laws, and taboos became 
more elaborate as runaway indicators of high conscientiousness and 
low openness. New sects began to break off when young worshippers 
wanted to show off different personality traits, such as openness, extra-
version, and agreeableness (for example, revolutionary early Christians 
versus conservative Pharisees, inclusive Mahayana versus exclusive 
Hinayana Buddhists). This gradual market segmentation in the reli· 
giaus sen~ces industry replaced the regional monopolies (Europe's 
Catholicism, India's Hinduism) ,vith a proliferation of start-up reli-
gions. Consumer choice 
religion became guided less by family tradi-
tion and more by individual selection of personality display strotegies, 
Thus, you can probably make some valid character inferences about 
people today who choose to be Quakers (agreeable, intelligent) versus 
Agreeableness 
251 
Satanists (disagreeable, impUlsive), or Zen Buddhists (open, stable) 
versus Orthodox Jews (conservative, conscientious). Recent spoof reli-
g10ns can be even mare revealing. If your office cubicle includes a cof-
fee mug spotting the slogan "WWFSMD?" (What would the Flying 
Spaghetti Monster do?) co-workers can readily infer that you are an 
ironic, secular, highly open "Pastafarian" who supports evolution and 
opposes "intelligent design" and school prayer. 
The same is true of the political ideology industry. American Dem-
ocrats and British Labour voters tend to be more agreeable and more 
open; Republicans and British Conservative voters tend to be more 
conscientious and 
open. Thus, an ObamafBiden bumper sticker 
in 2008 was not just a conlent~free injunction to vote Democrat; it was 
a content-rich display of the driver's social, sex-ual, and cultural open-
ness. The personality-indicating function of political ideology helps 
explain why political arguments are usually a waste of time. Trying to 
convince someone to switch from Green to Libertarian on the basis 
of rational arguments and empirical evidence is as futile as trying to 
change someone's inherited personality type by these means. Likewi.se, 
regardless of abstract political principles, anxious introverts won't favor 
legalizing Ecstasy, and chaste wives won't favor legalizing prostitution. 
Odd positions taken by political parties are often attempts to maintain 
their personality-indicating power rather than logical expressions of 
basic moral·political principles. For example, Republican opposition to 
gay marriage is not derived from the party's 1854 foundatlOnal beliefs 
in Federalism, abolitionism, and 
speech, but it is simply consis. 
tent with modern Republican identity as the party of high chastity 
("family values") and low openness ("conservatism"), 
Signaling Failures in Ideology 
One of the most frustrating experiences in human life is to adopt an 
unfashionable new worldview after 
evidence-based research , 
rational consideration of alternatives, and ethical soul-searching, only 

252 
S PEN T 
to have one's peers misconstrue that world view as a personality sig-
nal that conveys the opposite of one's true traits and intentions. This 
is a common experlence among evolutionary psychologists, and it 
nicely illustrates the way that ideology signals can fail under certain 
conditions. 
Critics such as Stephen Jay Gould, Steven Rose, and Richard 
Lewontin have convinced a substantial portion of the educated pub-
lic that evolutionary psychology is a pernicious right-wing conspiracy, 
with the hidden ideological agenda of reviving biological determinism, 
sexism, racism, and elitism. They conflate the worst excesses of 1860s 
social Darwinism, 18905 union-busting capitalism, 1930s Nazi eugen-
ics, and 1970s SOCiobiology with the twenty-first-century science of 
human nature. 
\>Vhat the critics fail to explain, however, is why evolutionary psy-
chology has attracted the support of so many SOCially conscious pro-
gressive thinkers, ranging from the animal rights philosopher Peter 
Singer to the economist Robert Frank, tne arencritic of runaway con-
sumerism. They likewise fail to explain why so many prominent evo- , 
lutionists (E. O. Wilson, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith) have' 
had strong ties to left-wing polities in their private lives. And they fail, 
to explain why right-wing American fundamentalists see evolutionary 
psychology as an ultraliberal attack on family values and religion. 
To determine whether evolutionary psychologists are actually right-
wing conspirators, my colleagues Josh Tybur, Steve Gangestad, and I . 
conducted an online survey of 168 psychology Ph.D. students (from. 
six major U.S. universities), 31 of whom self-identified as "adaptation-
ists" (evolutionary psychologists), and 137 of whom identified with 
some other theoretical framework. Both groups were about 70 percent 
female and about twenty-seven years old on average. Of the 31 evolu-
tionary psychologists, none identified with the Republican Party, and 
only 2 identified with the Libertarian Party. None of them voted for 
George W. Bush in 2004, and only 1 vored for the Libertarian Michael 
Badnarik. (This contrasts with the 30 percent of Americans who iden-

253 
tify with the Republican Party, and the majority of voters who alleg-
edly supported George \iV. Bush in 2004.) On sixteen questions about 
political attitudes, evolutionary psychologists scored significantly 
more liberal than conservative on fifteen of them. (They were evenly 
split on the last item.) For example, of the 31 evolutionary psychol-
ogy Ph.D. students, 30 supported gay marriage, 29 supported envi-
rornnentalism, 26 supported abortion rights, 25 supported universal 
health care, 21 opposed cutting the federal income tax, 19 supported 
marijuana legalization) 17 supported raising the Ininimum wage, and 
17 opposed preemptive military actions against foreign countries. On 
political issues, evolutionary psychologists were just as liberal as non-
evolutionary psychologists (and even more liberal on individual rights 
and social libertarian issues), and vastly more liberal than the gen-
eral U.S. population. Our sample size of 31 evolutionary psychologists 
is not a high number, but it is a high proportion-roughly one-third 
to one-half-of all students then enrolled in U.S. evolutionary psy· 
chology Ph.D. programs. We can be fairly confident that evolutionary 
psychologists are politically similar to academic psychologists in gen-
eral. To the religious right, and even to most Americans, we look like 
godless, gay-friendly, tree-hugging pacifists. Only the old guard of the 
1960s New Left (Gould, Rose, Lewontin) could possibly mistake us 
for conservatives. 
Thus, we have a signaling failure. Holding an evolutionary psy-
chology world view is still perceived by many educated people as an 
indicator of conservatism, disagreeableness, and selfishness, through 
a process of guHt by historical association with 1860s social Darwin-
ism. Yet empirically, holding an evolutionary psychology worldview is 
actually an indicator of liberalism, agreeableness, and altruism. Such 
mismatches between the apparent infonnation conveyed by an ideol-
ogy and the ideology's actual correlations with personality traits, are 
probably common for ideologies that are new or rare. People just don't 
have enough direct personal experience with the ideology adherents 
to disconfirm their media-fed prejudices. This explains why dominant 

254 
SF E N T 
ideologies can so easily maintain their monopoly power as signaling 
systems: they can portray alternative ideologies as signaling undesir-
able personality 
and thereby preempt any signaling benefit of 
switching ideologies. The result is a potent lock-in effect: certain ide-
ologies have certain personality correlates by historical association and 
common knowledge. So, it is very hard for advocates of a new ideology 
to gain a 
in public consciousness, unless the new ideology 
wears its pen;onality correlates very conspicuously on its sleeve.

The Centrifugal Soul 
How CAN WE as individuals live happily in a postconsumerist style 
that still lets us show off om personal traits, so that we obtain the 
and sexual attention we crave? I think it helps first to consider 
how much of one's "soul" 
abilities, personality traits, prefer-
ences, 
values-one is displaying too obsessively, too preemptively, 
too dizzily, and too pu b.licJy. Modern consumers are like children 
doing spin art: we pour om favorite colors all over a fast-spinning life-
style, fling pigment in all directions, and hope that some will stick to 
observers long enough for them to notice our composition. Given suf-
ficient resources, a few of us do succeed in attracting attention, so that 
we become the human equivalent of a sL,·foot-diameter Damien Hirst 
spin painting, such as Beautiful revolving sphincter, oops brown paint-
ing (2003). Most of us, however, just make a mess. We put too much 
of ourselves into our product hcades, spinning too much mass to am 
outer edges where we hope it is both publicly \,sible and instantly lov-
able. One problem with this strategy is that it 
too much blank 
space in the middle, so there's not much of ourselves left for lovers 
or friends to discover in the longer term. This could be called the 
centrifugal-soul effect: runaway consumerism leaves us feeling super· 
ficial and empty, because we project ourselves outward to observers 
too promiscuously and desperately. We forget the virtues of restraint, 
reticence, and dignity. We lose our capacity for self·contained, self-
sufficient self-judgment. We end up like a country without external 
horders or internal tradition. This chapter suggests some ways that we 
as individuals can overcome this centrifugal-soul effect. Later chap· 
ters address some changes in social norms and government policies 
tlml could hroaden the alternatives to conspicuous consumption.

The Renunciation Strategy 
Historically, those who renounce conspicuous consumption have most 
been religious or political zealots, such as Cahinists or Marx-
ists. They usually reject not Just runaway consumption, but all forms 
of self-display and all status seeking, whicb are seen as mortal sin, 
bourgeoiS decadence, or false consciousness, These humble egalitar-
ians have included Hindu asceticS, Buddhist monks, Cbristian saints, 
Puritans, and hippies. Of course, human nature always leads such 
renouncers to construct new status hierarchies of their own, based on 
costly behaVlOral displays of conscientiousness, lntroversion, and emo~ 
tional stability-and the fortitude to survive starvation, poverty, chas-
tity, and loneliness. Even the sadbus of India, who may sit for ycars 
witb onc ann lifted overbead, visibly atrophying, attain a certain social 
status-and receive food donations-from their conspiCUOUS rejection 
of conspicuous consumption. 
Modern renouncers are more likely to join the voluntaty-simplicity 
movement by subscribing to Heal Simple magazine and carrying a Slow 
Food USA tote bag. In either case, the renouncer.; remain awesomely 
self·deceived in believing that tbey have left behind the whole castle 
of self-display just hy escaping the dungeon of runaway consumption. 
Since this type of self-deception looks naIve and witless to those who 
understand the evolutionary origins and functions of se!f-display-
including my dear readers, by now-the renunciation strategy itself 
ends up looking stupid and childish. It speaks highly of tbe renouncer's 
conSCientiousness and agreeableness, but poorly of their intelligence, 
experience, and insight. 
Alternatives to Retail 
J t seems far more self-aware and creative to take a hard, consci()uS 
look at one's self-dIsplay strategies-to assess their true sodal and sex-
ual goals, their reliability and efficiency as trait displays, and the many 
alternatives that are available. 
The Centrifugal Soul 
257 
The standard self-display strategy in most developed societies is to 
seek the highest-paying full-time employment permltted by one's intel-
ligence and personality, and to use the resulting income to buy branded 
goods and services at full retail price. Weekdays are spent worldng; 
evenings and weekends are spent shopping. The purchases must serve 
a conf) icted dual role in signaling. On the one hand, their invidious 
price must testify to the traits of rational intelligence, conservatism, 
conscientiousness, and amorality demanded by most high-paying pro-
fessions and corporations. On the other hand, their style and leisure 
uses must testify to the opposite traits of emotional warmth, open-
ness, spontaneity, and virtue demanded by most mates and friends. 
The result is the bourgeois bohemian phenomenon so well described 
by David Brooks in Bobos i1. Paradise (2001), aspirants must act like 
obsessive brainiacs at work, and then switch personalities 180 degrees 
to act like sensual, eco-minded slackers at home. At work, they must 
embrace Adam Smith's division of labor: specialize, rationalize, dele-
gate, globalize. At home, they must pretend to enjoy making their own 
pasta. The commute becomes an existential transition zone between 
one false persona and its opposite. 
As a self-display strategy, it is very inefficient to buy new, branded, 
mass-produced products from stores at the full manufacturer's sug-
gested retail price. Tbe product comes into one's life naked and mute, 
without any sodal context, memorable circumstances, or narrative 
value. Nothing about the purchase says anything ahout one's traits, 
except one's ability to afford the purchase. One 
talk about the 
product as a distinctive object with a unique provenance. One can 
merely own it, use it, display it, and hope that someone appreciates 
its wealth display function. Almost evety other way of acquiring and 
displaying human artifacts or experiences sends richer Signals about 
one's personal qualities-though it usually brings less revenue to the 
retailer and manufacturer. In each case. the product's signaling value 
is hugely augmented hy the human capacity for language--by what 
one can say about the skills reqwred in making, finding, acquiring, 
IlHlinlOining, ~l1<I/or rep<liring it.

Suppose there IS a product that you think you want to buy, You've

carry much higher

think you want to buy a new physical product, consider these options

Just Don't Get It

Also, 
some indulgences, it's worth conSidering how much you 
would pay not to own the item, For example, Casteo sells M&M can, 
dies in sixty,four-ounce hags for about $8, I like M&Ms, so that seems 
like a great 
purchase if [ think I deserve a treaL However, at 
142 calories per ounce, lhat hag contains about 9,000 calories of milk 
chocolate, which, knowing myself, I would eventually eat, An inten-
sive aeroblcs class burns only 500 calories an hour, so it would take 
eighteen hours of aerobic lessons, at $10 per hour, to counteract the 
fat gain, So, rationally, I should be willing to pay aboul S 180 to the

many products, the lon~term net costs of ownership and consumption 
far outweigh the shornerm benefits, 
Find the One You Already Own 
If you're older than age thirty, and the product is a physical object that 
wasn't just invented, you probably al ready have one in your garage 
somewhere, Find it, clean it off, make it work, and use it instead, If you 
have to repair or upgrade it, so much the better-those are skills you 
can talk about when you use it in front of others, If your old product 
lacks certain features of newer products. it may have other compensat, 
ing charms (famillarity, retro deSign, proven reliability), Also, the nevv 
features can sometimes be retrofitted, If your old V-6 car lacks the

Borrow One from a Friend, Relative, or Neighbor 
Most big purchases are rationalized like this: the high initial capital 
cost will be amortized over mallY years of use. The product will be 
used hundreds of times, so the cost'per-use will grow ever smaller, 
and one's savings will grow ever larger. However, consumers with good 
memories and minimal self-deception will

purchases ever justified their cost in IhlS way. 
so many prod-
ucts get used a few times and are then forgotten, it is better to borrow 
them from an acquaintance, use them a few limes, and then retum 
them rather than haVing to store them. Borrowing also builds up social 
capital, as it promotes reCiprocity, trust, and social bonds. If you are 
conspicuously using an expensive product borrowed from a friend, it 
testifies to that friend's trust that you will use it carcfully and return it 
promptly-key components of conscientiousness. 
Rent It 
Given that you won't use most products nearly as often as you think 
you ;vill, it often makes sense to rent instead of buy. The sense of , 
ownership is a cognitive illusion, in any case, founded on a denial 
of habituation, consumer fashion cycles, technical progress, and Our 
own mortality. Buying something outright m"",,,s, at best, being able 
to use il until it becomes boring, unfashionable, or obsolete, or until 
one dies. Personal "ownership" is just a way of renting things from the 
universe for a human life span, or less. He who dies with the most 
toys. 
should have bought fewer toys and rented more. The true cost 
of ownership per product me is simply the price you pay for SOme-
thing when you buy it, minus the price you get when you sell it, give 
it away, lose it, or throw it away, divided by the number of times YOll 
use it. This cost is often amazingly high, and economists are routinely 
The Centrifugal Soul 
261 
puzzled by the human propensity to overbuy and underrent products 
that will see only occasional use. 
For example, if you truly think that driving a Ferrari F430 will 
impress a particular person on a particular date, just spend 
$] ,750 
to rent it for a day from Gotham Dream ears or wherever, rather than 
the $259,000 to buy it outright. You'd need to drive it on 150 dates 
before it would make more sense to buy it than rent it. If you don't get 
a second date with that particular person, you've saved yourself a lot 
of money. If you do get twenty more dates with the person and then 
marry him or her, you've still saved $224,000 for your house down 
payment If the person objects that you seduced him or her with a 
false display of wealth·-a rented rather than owned Ferrari-vou can 
always respond, "So you married me just for my money?" 
' 
You can rent almost anything these days: hOUSing, vehicles, tools, 
computers, electronics, formal clothing, even designer handbags (see 
Begborroworsteal.com--"a "'etflix for bags"). You can, de facto, rent 
almost any other durable consumer good by buying it retail and then 
returning it within thirty days for the full purchase price. (Think of 
the restocking fee as the rental cost.) Books, music, and movies can be 
often 
for 
from an underused institution called the public

Buy It Used

car, and get it at one·third of the price from him 
five years, when 
his compulsive novelty seeking turns to the next bright new thing, 
To take advantage of this strategy, one must overcome 
irratio· 
nal premium we put on pristine condition, and the irrational distaste 
we feel at the pre,owned, For example, one can get almost all clothing 
from thrift shops. In rich towns and suburbs, thrift 
are full of 
rarely worn, well'made, premium,brand clothes, including good cot, 
ton, linen, or silk shirts by Armani or Claiborne for about $5, which 
were more than twentr times that price new, (The quality, not the 
brand, is the point here.} Mostly, the dothes are only there because 
their original purchasers got fatter faster than expected, so couldn't 
wear them anymore. 
To feel comfortable buying used clothes, you just have to remember 
two things. First, "new" clothes have not been draped onto the retail 
store's rack by antiseptic angels who flew straight from an ISO Level 
l clean room. They have probably been handled by dozens of young 
Asian females in export'processing zone sweatshops, and transported 
for weeks in dusty, rusty cargo containers, and unpacked by store 
derks who may not have washed their hands after their Taco Relliunch 
break. 111e clothes are thus new not in the sense that a fresh,hatched 
baby newt 1S new, but in the sense that they have existed for only a few 
months, traveled only a few thousand miles, been handled by fewer 
than forty people, and been tried on by fewer than five customers, 
Second, you must remember that "used" clothes were simply bought 
and worn by humans who were genetically, biochemically, and derma-
tologically Just like you, who mostly avoided stains and washed them 
regularly. 
thrift store has already disinfected and cleaned them 
beyond any requirements of germ'phobic obsessive,compulsives. If 
you are a misanthrope at heart, the thought of wearing other people's 
clothing, like the thought of their existing at all, may make your toes 
curl and your teeth clench. But if you have a reasonable sense of soH-
darity with )'our 
wearing clothes pre,owned by strangers will 
seem nO more offens;,'e than wearing clothes pre'owned by siblings or

Buy It in Generic, Replica, or Trickle-Down Form 
The rise of Asian manufacturing, combined with the poor enforcement 
of trademark 
in Asia at present, means that high-quality generic 
and replica forms of many products arc available, As we saw earlier, 
midprice 
watches work about as well as real luxury 
watches, and are virtually indistinguishable without a jeweler's loupe 
and expert knowledge. More generally, technical and fashion innova' 
tions characteristic of premium brands are trickling down to mass, 
market brands with 
speed, This means that premium 
branding is becoming ever less distinctive as an objective marker of 
product quality and novelty. 
Make It Yourself 
If we bought products purdy for their use value, the division-of· labor 
principle would imply that making things l'ourseifis almost neverratio' 
nal. Someone else could make it far more effiClently than you could, 
since he already has the workspace, tools, and skills, However, the 
that we often buy products for their display value implies that it is very 

264 
S PEN T 
often sensible to 
things yourself, smce self-made items can be 
much more effective trait displays than other-made items, Of course, 
this is the unconscious function of hobbies and crafts, and explains 
why rationally specialized professionals, whose time on the open mar-
ket is worth more than $lOO an hour, devote evenings and weekends 
to making things that a Chinese factory worker could make in about 
6.3 minutes for twelve cents. Hobbies and crafts allow one to display 
intelligence, creativity, and conscientiousness across a broader set of 
domains than one's formal work permits, They also result in physical 
objects more easily appreciated by nonspecialists (such as raku serv-
ing bowls or macrame swimwear), rather than professional achieve-
ments in corporate tax law or amorphous silicon engineering that are 
beyond the comprehension of friends and neighbors. Economists may 
feel that house spouses who frequent Hobby Lobby, or celebrities who 
wash their own c,1rS, are contemptibly ignordot of Adam Smith's great 
division-of-Iabor insight. Yet their own spouses, children, and nelgh-
bors may appreciate fewer self-righteously rational judgments and 
more home-baked chocolate-chip cookies, 
Making lhings yourself is easiest, most frugal, and most effective 
as a display when the materials and tools required are cheap, when 
the skills are easily learned but seldom ma.stered, and when the things 
made are actually useful, beautiful, and visible, You can create pre· 
sent able dining room tables and bookcases given some hardwood 
stock, a simple table saw, a basic knowledge of carpentry, and a stock 
of Band-A ids, Cooking, sewing, jewelry making, and pottery can yield 
impressive self-made items for similarly low start-up costs. Even when 
an item cannot be made from scratch, the components are often avail· 
able for home assembly, as in the case of personal computers. YOll can 
buy the case, motherboard, power supply, hard drive, and sO on, wire 
them together, and have a truly personalized product that displays your 
arcane wisdom about the mysteries of the electron. 
Less suitable products for self-manufacture include scuba gear, 
carabiners, airpianes, pacemakers, and artillery. I also cannot recom-
mend making anything at home that requires thermall,1nces that burn

above 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, or things that rotate faster than 
10,000 rpm. Safety first-unless you feel obligated to display your 
capacities for risk taking and limb regeneration, 
Consumerism's Cthulhu-like tentacles have, of course, reached 
right into all home-manufacturing activities, and transformed them 
into runaway consumption domains in their own right. Hobby maga-
z.ines proclaim that every new pursuit requires purchasing a new set of 
conspicuously costly, wasteful, precise, reputably branded tools, sup-
plies, and accessories. !t is easy to become convinced that, to make 
a bookcase that would cost S80 from IKEA, you must buy a $J,OOO 
carpenter's workbench. $600 table saw, $500 biscuit joint's, and $300 
router (ignoring my advice above about high-rpm tools). Indeed, this 
is what most guys do, and this is what sustains Home Depot and tool 
brands such as Craftsman, DeWalt, and Makita. Luckily for you, some 
of your friends and neighbors have probably already failen for the delu-
sion that their social status and sexual prospect:; \Aill be magically 
enhanced by the existence of high'powered, premium-brand wood· 
working tools in their garage. You can go borrow them; it will saVe you 
money, and reduce their guilt about the tools' never being used, 
Commission It from a Local Artisan 
things are too hard to make yourself, but can be made by local 
specialists. This of len yields a huge display advantage at only a small 
cost prem ium above t he mass-produced version of the product. A ClIS-
tom item, designed or specified by oneself, and handmade by a local 
artisan whom one met face-to·face, is a much mOre distinctive pos-
session or gift. It displays one's resourcefulness, creativity, tasle, and 
social skills in collaborating with the artise For example, when buying 
jewelry for a Significant other's birthday, one could always go to the 
mall at the last minute and grab some ten-karat die-strllck abomina-
tion of a ring at an 80 percent markup. Or, one could plan ahead, talk 
tn a local artisan, eollaboratively design something unique, and have 
it haml-fabricatcd in twenty-karat gold, The materials will cost more, 

266 
5?E N T 
but 
markup will be lower, and the ring's quality ,,~Il be higher. 
Also, the narrative value of giving something unique will be melt-
ingly romantic. Commissioning likewise displays very high creativity, 
resourcefulness, commitment, and conscientiousness. Indeed, a per-
sonally commissioned handmade ring in sterling silver may elicit mOre 
gratitude than a mass·produced platinum band. 
As another example, many families buy mass-designed houses 
built in alienating new suburbs by huge developers. The structures are 
designed to the lowest common denominator of taste in the current 
fashion, so their aesthetic value depreciates qUickly. They are built to 
poor standards-two-by-four stick lumber and half-inch Sheetrock on 
concrete slabs-so their physical integrit), deteriorates qUickly. The 
houses are not supported by adequate investment in surrounding 
infrastructure-roads, parks, schools, well·planned retail-so their 
quality of life depreciates qUickly. The result is that in many commu-
nities, five-year-old houses have lower equity value than new ones. A 
good alternative is to commission a distinctive new family house from 
an up,and-coming local architect on a vacant plot in an established 
community. The build cost pe, square foot may be sHghtly higher than 
for a mass-designed developer house, but 
display value-and home 
equity-per dollar spent will he much higher. Instead of moving into a 
house built by nameless, faceless workers, you can move into a house 
that you codesigned with an architect who might become a friend, 
and a house that you saw being built by local workers whose names 
you'll learn and whose workmanship you'll admire, You'll also learn 
much more about the house, so its features and functions can be more 
knowledgeably appreciated by you and discussed with others, vVhereas 
others live in houses they understand only superficially, you'll be able 
to understand all the systems-foundation, framing, roofing, f1oonng, 
electrical, plumbing, HVAC, storage, security, decorating-as func-
tional wholes, You'll maiotain them better and repair them more e<JS-

Wait Three Years Before Buying New Technologies 
Technical innovations are terrific-they dnve economic progress, 
increase quality of life, and give us new things to talk about. But you 
don't have to be one of the early adopters who pay for the new tech-
nologys research and development. Companies usually try to recoup 
the cost of innovation through very high premium pricing of new tech-
nologies. These are bought most a,~dly by that golden market seg-
ment, the eightccrHo,thirty-fouryear-old single male demographic, 
because those are the humans who invest the highest proportion 
of their money, time, and energy into mating effort, including con, 
spicuous consumption. 
after the horny rich boys all own the 
technology, the companies gradually lower their prices and enter the 
mass market. This is when LCD TVs get .~o percent cheaper every 
six months. The price lowering must be gradual enough that there is 
no obvious point where everybody suddenly considers the new

puter specifications for just $40,000, But before getting that second

Acknowledge the Display Premium 
Built into Most Retail Products 
If you still must have the new, branded, full-retail-price product, and 
nobody will give it to you, it is at least wise to ca Iculate and acknowl-
edge whatever display premium is built into the product's retail cost. 
For example, earlier in this book I discussed how most basic electro-
mechanical products, ranging from small appliances and electronics 
through large appliances and cars, cost about $10 per pound, If an 
electromechanical product costs more than about $12 per pOlmd, it 
is probably a premium brand or newly marketed item that includes 
a substantial conspicuous-consumption surcharge above its manufac-
turing cost. For example, a Toyota Camry costs about $7.00 per pOlmd 
(S24,000 for thirty-four hundred pounds), whereas a Lexus LS costs 
about S16,50 per pound (571,000 for forty-three hundred pounds), 
The Lexus luxury-car premiulll is obvious from its much higher cost 
per pound, despite its being assembled of similar materials to a similar 
level of precision by the same parent company, So, if you must have 
the Lexus, that's OK, as long as you conSciously accept two things; (I) 
apart from its higher mass, you are paying an extra $40,000 for 
Lexus badge, and (2) everyone who sees you driving the LeXllS, and 
who has read this book, will assume that you could think of nothing 
in the world more creative, kind, or conscientious to do with $40,000,

Taming the Centrifugal Soul 
Some common themes emerge from these slightly whjmsical sugges-
tions. One is that buying new, real, branded, premium products at full 
price from chain-store retailers is the last refuge of the unimagina-
tive consumer, and it should be your last option, It offers low narrative 
value-no stories to tell about interesting people, places, and events 
associated with the product's design, provenance, acquisition, or usc. 
It reveals nothing about you except your spending capacity and your 
gullibility, conformism, and unconsciousness as a consumer. It grows 
no physical, 
or cultural roots into your local environment. It 
does not promote trust, reciprocity, or social capital. It does not expand 
your circle of friends and acquaintances, It does not lead you to learn 
more about the invention, manufacture, operation) or maintenance of 
the things around )'ou< 
Retail spending reveals such a narrow range of traits: the capacities 
to earn, steal, marry, or inherit wealth, and the perceptual memory 
and media access required to spend the wealth on whatever is adver-
tised most avidly now. The alternatives listed above try to minjmiZ€ 
retail spending not Just to save money, but to maxlmize trait display 
power They do not renounce the emotional centrality of narcissistic 
self-display in human life, but they redirect it into tactics that are both 
cheaper and more effective, 
Because many of these tactics 
less money but more time, 
they might seem inefficient to economists who are always weighing 
one's opportunity costs: in principle, every hour 
leisure time taken 
costs one an hour of work uncompensated. If a male lawyer who can 
bill $300 per hour can buy a new shirt in ten minutes from Neiman 
Marcus for $ 100, rather than searching through a thrift store for forty 
minutes to buy a used shirt for $5, he should logically bu)' the ncw 
shirt, which saves $150 in potential billable hours, This is true as far 
as it goes, but it ignores the larger context of the retail purchase< A 
fair comparison must take into account the total shirt-research

shirt-purchase time, If the lawyer spent fifty minutes broWSing GQ 
magazine to see which leisure shirts are in fashion, twenty minutes 
chOOSing which onc he prefers, ten minutes calling local stores to 
fmd out who has it in stock, sLxt)' minutes driving to and from :'-lei-
man lVIarcus, and forty post-purchase minutes defending his GQ 
reading and shirt purchasing against his wife's aesthetic skepticism, 
then he's really spent three hours on the shirt purchase, and its cost 
is really $1,000: $100 retail cost and $900 opportunity cosL By con-
trast, he could have driven to the nearest t hritt store, used its logical 
arrangement of stock by garment type, 
and color to quickly iden-
tify some interesting shirts, tried them on, picked one, and bought it, 
in a total shirt-purchase time of about one hoUf. If his wife doesn't like 
shirt, no problem it only cost $5. It could be burned impulsively 
on the barbecue to display his respect for the wife's superior aesthetic 
judgment, and she would love him for it, and they could have con-
nubial canoodling for two whole hours, and 
would still come out

something, Or some trait display, 
This is where making something yourself speaks much morc loudly 
than a premade thing's retail price, and a little perspective taking 
shows why, Consider which kind of Valentine's Day gift you would 
rather receive from someone whose affection you crave but doubt: (1) a 
dozen 
roses ordered online, and delivered with a generic "Loads of 
love" computer-printed note, or (2) a customized sonnet, composed by 
the loved one, written on handcrafted paper, and delivered with home-
made chocolate teu mes decorated with the candied violets that you 
once mentioned liking in an e-mail eight months earlier? The latter 
would constitute a hugely more compelling display of personal interest 
(affection, thoughtfulness, lustful intent) and of personal traits (cre-
ativity and conscientiousness in the domains of poetry, calligraphy, 
cuisine, and pulp-arid-deckle work), You can tell that the latter is more 
compelling because it also makes a better story to tell your family and 
friends,

American tourist)

informative about the wearer than the product's physical features or

The Promise of Mass Customilation 
'vVe yearn to display our distinctive traits-our individuality, uni'lue-
ness, identity-in as many of our possessions as possible, Those who 
can afford customized products tend to buy them: whether in the form 
of tailored dothes, commissioned portraits, or custom yachts, the 
wealthy prefer the bespoke, However, many products would simpl)r

nately, some new technologies of mass customization will make it ever 
easier for a wider range of customers to "express their individuality" 
(display their traits and preferences) through products made uniquely 
for them. 
The idea of mass cllstomizatiol1 is that companies use the efficiency 
and precision of mass production technologies to make unique prod-
ucts for particular customers, according to their specifications, The 
"batch size" for any given production run IS 
from thousands of 
units to a single unit. This build-lo-order system requires shifting to a 
leaner, more flexible production line, and demands real-time control of 
the supply chain. However, it benefits producers by reducing wasteful 
inventory, and it benefits customers by delivering a product that fits 
their preferences more precisely, 
For example, if Role:. were set up for mass customization, and you 
wante'd a picture of your newborn daughter etched onto the face of 
a new Rolex President watch, you COli ld visit their website, upload a 
digital photo of your daughter, select from a few options, pay for the 
watch, and get it in the mail within a week. Or, if you wanted the

process is easiest for products 
that can be surface detailed using digital printing or etching technol-
ogy (watch faces), mixed from standard materials (paint pigments), 
assembled out of standard modules (Dell computers, Renault cars, or 
package holidays), or cut from thin materials using computer-controlled 
lasers or routers. Typical applications are in product categories such as 
Cllstomized books, posters, or T-shirts, mixing custom-perfumed toi-
letries, or weaving custom textiles (as has been done with programma-
ble Jacquard looms since 1801). The site Colorwarepc.com is already

technologies that might allow a customer to buy an iPod shaped like 
their favorite species of tropical fish, or a BMW M5 that looks like 
the Batmobile, Such applications raise new issues of product safety 
nnd reliability-an iPod shaped like a lionfish might cause piercing 
or stabbing injuries; fins might break off and be swallowed by tod-
dlers or Shih Tzus; lionfish-phobics might sue for emotional distress,

freedom to create a unique product that signals distinctive traits and

The Will to Display 
SUPPOSE 
t 
HAVE been right about consulller narcissism-its 
evolutionary-psychological roots, modern manifestations, and perva-
sive faHures to deliver the trait-display benefits we want? Wnat can we 
do ahout those failures, not just at the personal level as addressed in 
the 
chapter, but at the social, political, and cultural levels? 
Friedrich Nietzsche argued thm most human action is driven by a 
"will to power"-we try to thrive as organic beings through dominance, 
daring, and resource appropriation. His was a vision of lone lllpha 
males gaining existential insights on Alpine peaks, then descending 
to enJoy the frUits of public 
book deals, harems, and weiss-
hier. In Spent I have argued that among highly social primates like us, 
who reliably rebel against Hefeweizen-swilling philosopher-kings, the 
evolved "will to display" (gaining fitness benefits through 
and 
status) can be even more important than the "will to power" 
ing fitness benefits through dominance and threats). Consequently, a 
central question for social polley is this: How can we harness the will 
to display so it makes us all happier? Strategies to change OUt runaway 
consumerist culture can work on many levels, but the least effective 
levels are often overemphasIzed in social-policy debates and ]X>litieal 
activism, while the most 
levels are often overlooked, 
Asymmetric 'Varfare 
Opting out of mainstream consumerism is like 
a new world of 
asymmetric warfare. In traditional symmetric

kctmen, or tallks, anti we line up ours, and both sides fight it out until

one concedes or flees, and the other declares victory, In asymmetric 
warfare, the side that is weaker by traditional criteria seeks victor)' 
by using new tactics or technology, The British longbowmen defeated 
the French knights at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 by firing volleys 
of arrows from absurd distances, rather than waiting honorably to be 
squashed by the cavalry charge, The American revolutionaries of the 
1770s defeated the British redcoats through guerrilla tactics-cutting 
supply lines, harassing troops, sniping from a distance, and simply 
refusing to line up accommodatingly to get shot by the larger British 
forces, The Vietcong defeated the Americans in the 19605 through 
similar tactics, AI-Qaeda terrorists on 9/11 infuriated the Pentagon by 
hijacking our airplanes, rather than buying their Own from our arms 
dealers Cas Saudi citizens are supposed to), Innovations in asymmetric 
warfare are always initially considered to be treacher), and terrorism 
by the side that believes it is stronger according to traditional criteria, 
In retrospect, such tactics are inevitably reframed as natural historical 
progress in the efficient conduct of warfare, 
Likewise, every signaling imlovalion in human culture is at first 
considered unfalf and disreputable, at least by those who excelled at 
the previous signaling game, :Vledievallords were no doubt driven nuts 
by the minstrels and troubadours who used musical innovations (iso-
rhythmic motets. polyphony, even madrigals l) to seduce their wives· 
and daughters, rather than winning them by the traditional methods i 
(physical fOTce, economic oppression, religious indocrrination), Elvis· 
wasn't playing fair by wiggling his hips and sneering, and Miles Davis 
wasn't playing fair by being so damned cool, handsome, and talented, 
From the viewpoint of social competitors and sexual rivals who "play 
fair" by getting formal educations, working full-time jobs, and paying 
full retail prices, any of these alternative ways of displaying one's per-
sonal traits seem like cheating. However, from the viewpoint of ratio-
nallndividuals seeking maximum social and sexual status at minimal 
cost, all these tactics were wonderfully liberating, Indeed, such signal-
ing innovations seem to drive most of the progress in the technologic's, 
ideas, and institullons that we cali dvilizHtion.

Why Not Trait Tattoos? 
Premise J, ConspIcuous consumption is a wasteful and ineffective 
way to display our psychological trairs to others, Premise 2: Those 
traits can be assessed fairly accurately from a few minutes of informal 
social interaction, but can be assessed even more accurately through 
formal intelligence and personality tests, These premises suggest an 
obvious solution, as mentioned in a previous chapter, to the problem 
of runaway consumerism encourage everyone to get his Central Six 
traits evaluated using the best available tests from reputable testing 
institutions, which could then tattoo the validated nait scores onto 
the entire population's foreheads, That way, everybody could see at a 
glance who they're dealing with and how they're likely to behave, This 
signaling system would obviate the need to display the Central Six 
through conspicuous consumption, 
Tb people who consider conspicuous consumption more dignified 
than facial tattoos, such a trait-tattoo system may sound like an outra-
geous affront to human dignity, 1b people like me who live in Albu-
querque, where many people are poor and many do have facial tattoos, 
it doesn't seem so absurd, The question is whether it would work, buth 
technically and socially, 
We've already discussed the problem that trait tattoos would not be 
reliable if individuals themselves were responsible for telling the tattoo 
artists what their Central Six scores were, However, it would be fairly 
easy to make the trait tattoos technically reliable and hard to fake, given 
some modest jmprovements in trait~testjng institutions and technolo~ 
gies, The trait tattoos would need to be inscribed by a reputable test-
ing agency, in some sort of conspicuously precise form that would be 
no easier to counterfeit than currency, The testing institutions would 
need to be honest, transparent, closely monitored, publicly account-
able, and hard to bribe, The tests would need to be objective, reliable, 
valid, and in the public domain, subject to continuous improvement 
through open scientific research and peer review, The tests would

at regular intervals, depending on the empirically observed stability 
of trait ScOres across the life span, (Studios show that the Big Five 
become progressively better differentiated, more coherent, and more 
stable from ages ten to twenty, for examplo,) If someone doesn't want 
his trait scores tattooed On his forehead, he would ask for the scores to 
be held in private as his personal property, to be revealed only at his 
request to a potential employer, neighbor, mate, or any other person, 
who could be sent an unfakeable, electronically authenticated test-
score report. 
Intelligence researchers already know how to measure general 
intelligence accUIately, and the EducatIOnal Testing Service already 
knows how to make IQ·type test scores hard to fake, [t would be more 
challenging to measure the Big Five personality traits through new 
objective tests, rather than via the self-report questionnaires currently 
used, At the moment, the dosest things \\"e have to such objective per-
sonality measures are certain documents requested by employers: the 
criminal background check and college transcript as fairly good indica· 
tors of conscientiousness; the recommendation letters, personal refer· 
ences, and job interviews as fairly poor indicators of agreeableness and 
stability, We could, in fact, do much better, using current test theory 
and methods, plus a little imagination, For example, an individual's 
Big Five traits could be assessed quite accurately by averaging anony-
mized peer ratings from a large sample of that individual's neighbors, 
acquaintances, co-workers, old friends, and ex-lovers, These people 
have observed the individual across a wide variety of situations, states, 
and moods, and they have unconSCiously learned to see through the 
individual's ways of presenting a good facade in short-term interac-
tions, By aggregating their knowledge, the information-sharing power 
of gossip and reputation in small-scale human societies could be rep· 
licated at the scale of modern economies, Everyone else in the world 
could know as much about each individual as that individual's whole 
social network already knows,

response patterns are most closely associated with each personality 
trait, it should become possible to assess the Big Five by exposing peo-
ple to various Virtual-reality situaUons during brain-scanning sessions. 
A final option would be to go straight to the genotype, Compa-
nies such as 23andMe and Cambridge Genomics already offer "con. 
sumer genomics"' and "personal genetic testinK" Geneticists are poised 
to sequence a person's entire genome for under $1,000 v.ithin a few 
years, I've argued in some recent papers that specific alleles (forms 
of genes) that are associated with personality traits should be much 
easier to lind than specific alleles associated with general intelligence 
or general health, Some personality·related genes have already been 
identified; others are heing discovered at a rapid rate. It will be quite a 
few years before brain imagmg or genotyping achieves the personality-
assessment accuracy that we can now attain using large samples of 
peer ratings Or actual behaviOrs, yet eventually, using all these meth-
ods together should yield good objective measures of the Big Five,

(tattoo displayers) and receivers (tattoo viewers)) If social norms favored 
having the trait tattoos, everyone would have social incentives to get 
them, even if they scored pretty badly on some lraits, This is one of the 
most surprising predictions from costly signaling theory You might think 
that only people with very high intelligence would volunteer to get their 
lQ scores tattooed on their foreheads, and indeed that might be true at 
first: only IQ-150 geniuses would botheL But then, ail the people with 
an IQ between 125 and 150 would want to show that, even if they're not 
geniuses, they're a lot brighter than most of the other nun-tattooed folks 
(whose average might now be about 95), so they would follow suit Then 
ail the people ,vith an IQ between 100 and 125 would want to show that 
they're at least average compared with all the remaining untattooed folks 
(whose average is now about 90), so they'd get the tattoos, And so on 
down the whole lQ range, even the mildy retarded (IQ range 50-70) or 
their guardians might want to show that at least they're not retarded to 
a moderate (IQ 40-50), severe (lQ 20-40), or profound (lQ below 20) 
level, The same reasoning applies even more powerfully to the Big Five 
personality traits, whleh don't have such a dearly ,'alue-Iaden dimension, 
If people are happy to advertise their levels of openness or e>:traversion 
through bumper snckers, they might be equally willing to do so through 
tattoos, 
However, it might ultimately be hard for people to accept the trait 
tattoos as worthy of attention, Tbe problem here is the way that our 
perceptual systems Dre wired up to our person-perception systems, 
\,Ve have evolved exquisite abilities to make unconscious inferences 
about other people's psycholOgical traits, by observing their beha,~or, 
But those abilities were adapted to prehistoric conditions, and they 
"expect" the relevant social information to corne in certain natural

emotional responses such as awe, admiration, deference, envy, friend-
liness, or Ius!' By contrast, there are hundreds of other perceivable 
cues of intelligence that may be equally reliable and valid, but that 
reach our ears and eyes in evolutlonarily novel ways that Our person-
perception systems did not evolve to process so easily, For instance, 
a complete 3-D MRI scan of someone's brain might convey as much 
objective information about his intelligence as hearing him play an 
awesome drum solo, but inspecting a brain scan just cannot inspire 
as much social respect or sexual attraction as moving one's body to a 
compelling rhythm, Likewise, a trait tattoo might convey more-reHable 
information about intelligence than a ten-minute conversation, but it 
camlOt spark the emotions that drive social interaction, There seems to 
be no easy shortcut through Our person-perception systems, We have 
to feed them the kinds of social stimuli that they evolved to expect, 
and institutionally validated trait tattoos are not among those stimuli. 
By contrast, our person-perception systems seem surprisingly happy, 
after just a couple of decades of consumerist socialization, to process 
information about an individual's conspicuously wasteful, precise, 
andlor reputable possessions, and to make personality inferences on 
their basis, 
Although institutionalized objective tests of people's Central Six 
traits may never replace more natural forms of information about peo-
they may still prove useful in some situations, For example, how 
much would you pay before a first date to get accurate, objective, elec-
tronically validated information about a suitor's true personality traits,

scans, and genotyping) II I were Single, I would buy that for a dollar,

everYone a whole lot of time, trouble, and money. We wouldn't need to 
ask for references from three previous clients if 150 of their friends, 
relatives, in-laws, neighbors, and ex-spouses have already rated their 
conscientiousness, agreeableness, and stability. The same sort of con-
sumer feedback that has revolutionized shopping for goods on the 
Internet (based on percent-positive feedback from customers) could 
revolutionize shopping for personal and profeSSional services. 
One might think that common sense alone would suffice to 
help people avoid narcissistic dates or disagreeable doctors. But if 
such individuals were that easy to detect and avoid, those heritable 
trajts would have already been eliminated from the gene pooL The 
encUess co-evolution between our truth-seeking person-perception

boy; with psychopathy or goth girls with borderline personality disor·

attraction. Mass social transparency sounds frightening and embar· 
rassing, but it is what humans have been striving for ever since the 
prehistoric development of gossip, reputation, "face," and status sym· 
boIs. It would allow at least some rational people, some of the time, to 
choose their friends, mates, co-workers, and neighbors more quickly 
and accurately. 
Prerequisites for Buying Certain Products 
Trait tattoos might not work socially because they don't express traits 
in the right information formats to be processed easily by om person· 
perception systems. However, there m"y be more lIser-friendly or 
The Will 10 Display 
285 
easy-to-learn ways that individuals could display their validated trait 
scores. 
For example, companies could sell certain products only to con-
sumers who have a certain minimum or maximum score on one or 
more of the certain Central Six traits. Hummer dealers could adver-
tise tbat the "Party Animal Red Pearl" paint color is available only to 
customers who score in the top 5 percent for extraversion. CuStOll1-
ers who want to display their unusuaJly high extraversion through that 
bright red color would have to electronically validate their extraversion 
score at the dealership before they could sign the purchase agreement. 
In this way, Hummer could guarantee tbat Party Animal Red Pearl 
becomes a reliable signal of friendliness, self-confidence, and ambi-
tion. Or, LeA'lls could sell the "Mensa Quartz Metallic" color of the 
LS 460 only to customers whose validated inte.lI igence scores are high 
enough for them to join Mensa International (IQ 130+, or the top one 
in fifty). The more exclusive "Prometheus Glacier Pearl" color could 
indicate an IQ above 160 (the top one in thirty thousand) -the qualifi-
cation for joining the Prometheus Society. 
Product prerequisites could include not just the Central Six traits, 
but any information that customers would be willing to divulge by giv-
ing the retailer access to electronic records. This information could 
include age, sex, residence, education, employment, financial records, 
marriage records, medical records, paternity tests, church attendance, 
political-party registration, or previous purchase history-any data 
that might be relevant, and that could be somehow validated. For 
instance, Durex could sell a "Clean Submarine" brand of motorcycle 
helmet only to males who have regularly tested negative for all sexu-
ally transmitted diseases. Or, the Mormon Church could sell a "10 for 
10" model of laptop computer only to members who have paid their 10 
percent tithe on gross income regularly for at least 10 years. 
Products could even require some socially or sexually desirable 
combination of traits. The "Mr. Right" model of Sketchers casual 
shoes could be sold only to Single males age twenty-five to forty who 
have higb intelligence, high conscientiousness, and high stability-

the "good dad" traits that women seek for marriage. The "Happy 
Fluffer" jacket from Spyder Skiwear could be sold only to smgle 
females age eighteen to twenty-nine who have high openness, high 
agreeableness, and high impulsivity (low conscientiousness}-the 
cueS of sexual availability that men seek for short-term mating, 
How exactly would this system work? Trait prerequisites and a prod-
uct barcode number would be registered for each of these products 
with an International Test Score Database, which would also contain 
test scores for every customer who wants to participate in the system. 
The test scores would be based on the same sort of objective measures 
mentioned for trait tattoos-intelligence lests, peer ratings. electronic: 
communication records (for example, number of Facebook friends), 
perhaps even brain scans and genotypes. At the point of purchase. the 
customer would present his International Test Score JD card, and the 
cashier would make sure the ID card photo and biometrics matched 
the customer. The cashier would scan the produds barcode into the 
pOint-of-sale computer connected to the database, which would autho' 
rize the sale if that customer's trait scores matched those required for 
the purchase. The database would hire legions of ·'mystery shoppers" 
to make sure cashiers wcre not making unauthorized sales that vio-
lated the product prerequisites and thereby undermined the product's 
signaling power, 
At first glance, the "product prerequisite" system might seem coun-
terproductive. 'vVhy would a company want to restrict its potential 
target market by selling only to customers who have some set of speci-
fied trait scores or other background information) Think aoout it for a 
minute. This would be by far the easiest way for a neW product with a 
particular brand personality to position itself in relation to customers 
with certain personality traits andlor market segments with certain 
demographic traits The signaling power of the product-and its desir-

A Government War on Bling? 
If trait tattoos aren't socially feasible 
marketers don't yet appre-
ciate the benefits of product prerequisites, how else could people 
display their Central 
traits without conspicuous consumption? 
Social scientists often reach straight for the bluoderbuss of govern-
ment policy whenever they see a social problem that needs fixing_ The 
recommended solutions usually create new programs to minimize 
the problem's human costs, and new laws to criminalize the alleged 
roots of the problem. This usually leads to new bureaucracies with 
vested interests in perpetuating the problem so they can continue to 
ameliorate its costs and punish its perpetrators, Moreover, individuals 
and nongovernmental institutions, who learn and adapt far faster than 
governments can, always end up exploiting the hidden loopholes and 
incentives structures of the new regime, The transient 1950s Com-

The examples could be multiplied ad nausea. 
every time a poli-
tician or policy wonk develops a new carrot-and-slick program to solve 
a social problem, and manages to get it Implemented in the manageri-
ally flawed, politically compromised, underfunded way that inevitably 
occurs in real life, he is always surprised by the harmful side effects of 
his good intentions. The brilliant new policy's failures arC then attrib-
uted to the flaws, compromises, and underfunding, f'dther than to the 
dubious conceit that complex social problems can be solved by simple 
government interventions_ 
So, I will not recommend new laws [0 criminalize consumer nar-

ment War on Bling. History shows that all such attempts to equalize

A Little Something Called Civil Society

agreeable system of trait display, what leverage do we have) We Amer-
icans may assume that the only alternative to a federal War on Blinl\ 
is a modest shift in personal lifestyle. As a nation of aspiring plain-

tiffs, we assume that if it's not in the law, it must reside in the private 
sphere, where personal tastes are beyond public discussion. This is 
because we have been brainwashed from birth to ignore all forms of 
social organization and cultural power that exist at levels of description 
other than the idealized Constitution, the amoral corporation, and the 
atomized individuaL 
Educated people elsewhere recognize that well-functioning societ-
ies include a few other factors that can shape human behavior rather 
powerfully: cultural traditions, social norms, customs, habits, lan-
guages, memes, etiquette rules, belief systems, and group identities. 
These systems of bebavioral norms constitute a little something called 
civil society. 
are what sociology and cultural anthropology study, 
albeit using the most obscure mcabulary possible ("ideologies," "dis-
courses," "hegemonies," ·'lifeways"l. They are what make life in north 
London different from life in North Dakota. They are what make 
Amsterdam cooler and happier than Krak6w or Karachi. 
In the late 1980s through the late 19905, development economists 
often touted the "\Vashington consensus," arguing that ponr countries 
could grow neh simply by setting up free markets, free trade, and stable 
currencies. After the stagnation of ex-Communist economies, the Asian 
currency crisis of 1997-98, and the rise of ethnic conflict and religious 
extremism, it became clear that prosperity requires more than just free 
markets. First, it requires the rule of law: good governance to enforce 
fair, stable laws regarding property rights, human rights, and social sta-
bility, as evaluated by the World Bank's Governance Indicators. Sec-
ond, it requires sociocultural traditions of accountability, transparency, 
morality, and truSt in politics and business. Third, it requires behavioral 
norms of valuing education, ambition, initiative, hard work, politeness, 
peacefulness, and social networking-in other words, norms that tend 
10 maximize the Central Six traits of workers and consumers. 
These social institutions and behavioral norms provide 
"ling systems" and "applications" with which all human institutions 
run-not JUSt governments and corporations, but ffillrr.a2es_ hi,pn,;_ 
ships, families, neighborhoods, public spaces, cities, professions,

S PE N T 
careers, games, leisure activities, churches, clubs, 
and chat 
rooms. This has always been true for human groups, especially during 
the past few thousand years in every stratified society w)th a complex 
division of labor. Civil society is where the action 
where reasoned 
argument and new knowledge can most effectively change people's 
lives for the beller. 
To effect change through civil society, one must understand and 
accept the informal systems of person perception, praise, and pun-
ishment on which such a system relies. People indoctrinated in 
hedonistic individualism, religious fundamentalism, or patriarchal 
nationalism-that is, 99 percent of humanity~-are not accustomed 
to thinking imaginatively about how to change society through chang-
ing its behavioral norms and institutional habits. Indeed, the more, 
extreme advocates of hedonistic individualism, such as many classical 
liberals, libertarians, rational-agent economists, and counterculture 
anarchists, tend to 
civil-SOCIety norms as a basis for changing or 
sustaining anything at the social level. 
A hidden reason for 
skepticism is that civil-society norms 
must rely on fallible personal judgment and a philosophically ineoher- . 
ent notion of 
will. Infannal social norms only work if individuals 
make inferences about the personalities, capabilities, and moral vir-
tues of others by observing their behavior. Such inferences are always 
based on incomplete infonnation, probabilistic cues, and past experi-
ences, so they are always fallible-and open to charges of prejudice, 
bias, and stereotyping. Likewise, informal social norms work only if 
individuals are willing to praise or punish others for observed behav-
iors and inferred traits that must logically be a joint product of their 
genes, environments, and accidents. \\le must be willing to act as if 
people are admirable for personal virtues and eu Ipable for personal 
failings-as if 
will existed, even though we know that, metaphysi-
cally, it does not. (Does this paradox identify an awkward hypocrisy at 
the heart of human sodallife? Absolutely_ Is there any way around it? 
Not that I can see.) 
These prerequisites for civil-society norms-fallible person PN-

291 
ception and a faith in 
will-have led to SOme notorious madness-
of-the-crowd excesses throughout history: Puritan witch hunts, Paris 
guillotines, Klan lynchings, Hutu versus Tutsi machete killings. True, 
such episodes pale beside the mass carnage inflicted by totalitar-
ian governments (Hitler, Stalin, Mao, :'I:1ugabe), but they are deplor-
able nonetheless, Paralyzed by the dangers of fallible judgment and 
the paradox of 
will, many Liberals and academics have explicitly 
rejected informal social norms as a basis for civil society. We espouse 
the ideologies of tolerance and diversity, which boil down to an unwill-
ing,ne,;, to praise or blame anyone for any behaviors. The result is that 
we have no leverage for effecting social change, except through gov-
ernment intervention. 
The Power of Informal Social Norms 
Recent research in game theory and experimental economics has 
shown that informal social norms can powerfully influence human 
behavior and sustain human cooperation. This is especiaUy tyue for 
systems of sociaUy distributed punishment, in which roany individu-
als impose sanctions on the few who do not behave properly. When 
individuals live in true societies, with repeated interactions among 
locally known neighbors who have the power to 
and punisb 
one another, these sanctions work as very effiCient, credible deterrents 
against antisocial behavior_ Punishing bad acts is much easier than 
rewarding good acts, because there are many low-cost ways to impose 
fitness costs on people (taking away their resources, statUS, freedom, 
or bodily organs), but only a few, high-cost ways to give them true fit, 
ness benefits (awarding them longer life, extra sexual partners, and 
babies). 
Social norms sustamed by the threat of informal neighborly punish-
ment can solve the problems of cooperation in many "games" studied 
by game theorists, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma and the 
common-pool resource dtlemma. 
games will sound tiresomely 
familiar to economists and lltterly obscure to everyone else. But they 

292 
S PEN T 
are important, because they reflect the key challenges of human social 
life in explicit, analyzable ways. If social norms backed up by infor-
mal punishment can promote cooperation in the iterated prisoner's 
dilemma, they can also, at least in principle, promote peace and hap-
piness in your life. 
This

OK to treat your neighbor as a villain if he acts like a villain. In 
fact, it's your cjvic duty-in the strict sense that civil society could 
not function ,,~tholJt sllch informal social punishments and rewards. 
Rural villages needed busybodies. Modern cines 
morallyasser-
tive citizens. Formal law, police, courts, and jails have never sufficed 
to sustain a collective quality of life worth living. Indeed, you don't 
need written constitutions, corporate mission statements, or personal 
catechisms if you have a genuine culture-a set of informal behavioral 
norms-that is tacitly understood and enforced by most people in a 
society. The British understand this perfectly well, ond find it amus-
ing that Americans whimper with existential vertigo if their national, 
corporate, Or individual values aren't written down somewhere on 
paper. Informal norms must do 99 percent of the daily work of shap-
ing human behavior in socially desirable directions. This principle has 
been clearly understood by every sane adult in every functioning soci· 
ety for thousands of years; Euro·American liberal academic subcul-
tures of the late twentieth century are the singular e.xception. Until 
the power of informal social norms is more broadly and conSCiously 
appreCiated, we'll continue to overlook the single most potent way that 
we can change society in general, and consumerism in particular. 
What Anticonsumerist Protesters l\.re Doing Wrong 
A dear understanding of civil SOCiety and informal behavioral nOrms 
can help identify not only points of maximum leverage for changing 
society, but also tactics that are bound to fail. Ever since the green 
movement of the 1970s, the traditional strategy for trying to change 
consumer hehavior has heen through verbal preaching amI admunish-
The will 10 DISplay 
293 
menlo Humans love to talk, especially when we are telling other people 
what to do. So, we have for decades 
one another vague encour-
agemems to respect Mother Nature, consume less, recycle more, buy 
green, think globally, act locally, be less selfish tlnd greedy, and live 
simply, In some cases, tnese tactics have worked surprisingly well, by 
creating new social norms and expectations, The preaching signals to 
everyone that tnere is a new status game in town, and that conspicu-
ously green behavior is the best new way to display one's conscien-
tiousness and agreeableness. In other cases, such preaching proves 
futile, because the sinners who most need 
(multinational cor-
porations, military-industrial complexes) don't 
personality traits, 
don't care about signaling them, and don't get any benefits from play-
ing the new green game. 
For example, anticonsumerism protesters often target large corpo-
rations and international trade organizations. They try to use the usual 
social-hominid tactics 
informal social sanctioning-preaching, pub-
lic humiliation, ostraCism, name-calling, and throwing rotten fruit. 
But the objects of their wrath are faceless institutions that have no 
conSClence or responsiveness to such sanctions, Or institutional leaders 
and functionaries whose real social lives have no o"erlap with those 
the protesters, and thus who are immune to suffering any real 
costs from the protesters' disaffection. The Nestle and WTO

As adults most of us have a social neTWork of around 150 people 
whom we know well enough that, if we met them in an airport, we 
would be happy to chat with them over drinks. In many domains, 
we feel comfortable praising or punishing these in·group acquain-
tances for good or bad behavior. We would commend them for altru' 
1sm toward family, friends, children, or animals, We would condemn 
them-with a wince, a scowl. a gentle remonstrance, a pointed ques-
tion, or an abrupt exit-if they revealed acts of cruelty or infidelity. We 
might even do so for ideological sins-for derogating minorities, enjoy-
ing pornography, or cursing within earshot ef nuns. Yet in most devel-
oped nations, there is a strange and strong taboo against condemning 
in·group members for acts of conspicuous consumption. If our airport 
drinking buddies reveal that they have bought a new Lexus or Stan' 
ford law degree, we feel obligated to praise their success, status, and 
taste. If they see an ad for some new cell phone of grotesquely con-
spicuous precision on the airport's propaganda screens (usually tuned 
to CNN, in the United States), and if they comment that they covet 
the product, we feel reflexively inclined to assent. ! wish instead that 
we had t he guts to say something like. 
Yeah, I wanted that phone once, too. But then I thought, I 
already have a pretty good phone, so why do I crave this thing? It's 
just going to cost hours of frustration to set up, and make me stare 
at little electronic screens even more than I already do, so I have 
even fewer face-to-face conversations like the one we are having

mini'sermons might sometimes fail by seeming too direct, offen-

through this consumerism pwblem together, as joint victims of bad 
habits" rather than "I'm a '~rtuous know,it-all anticonsumer, and you're 
a shallow, craven materianst." Especially in settings as alienating as 
airports, where personal identity 
paper,thin, and product brand-
ing feels thick and hot as la,'a, a few genuine words of personal contact 
and consumerist skepticism from an acquaintance can seem momen-
tously vivid. These words might resonate in the listener's memory for 
weeks to come, and resound every time he sees an ad or steps into a 
mall, they might even be rearticulated when he meets an acquain-
tance of his own in some future airport bar. (Nothing ever changes 
for the better ",thout someone's seeming overoptimistic about other

[n fact, these moments of one-on-one consciousness raising, 
compiled across individuals, in-groups, and history, are probably the 
main routes by whicn all social change occurs, They are how civil

may have simply prOvided the news-feed fodder to provoke private

Face·to·face discussions of consumerism can often go more 
smoothly than confrontations about topics like racism, se.xism, or 
homophobia, This is because when you point out that consumerism 
is a really inefficient way to advertise personal traits, you can praise 
someone' 5 traits and tickle their vanity even as you're duster bombing 
the central ideology around which they've organized their education, 
career, leisure, identity, status seeking, and mating strategy, As well·

that we stiD appear intelligent, attractive, and virtuous, (Don't forget 
to mention that, or people will cry,) 
Another, more subtle way of opening such conversations is through 
mentioning movies that address consumerism, Most people love to 
talk about movies, and do so In chummy, open,minded, leisure·chat

documentaries, people tend to revert to college,seminar debate mode, 
and become more intellectually prickly and ideologically defenSive,)

Multiculturalism Versus Local Social Norms 
There is a major legal problem with creating and enforCing new social 
norms in developed nations, and the problem concerns housing law,

most favored by the local community heavily influence our behavior, 
However, through antidiscrimination laws regarding property rental 
and ownership, many countries unwittingly prohibit the development 
and diversification of cohesive local nonns, For example, the u.s. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development prohihits "hous, 
iog discrimination based on your race, color, national origin. religion, 
sex, family status, or disability," The laws were passed with the best of 
intentions, but they have toxic side effects on the abiliry of voluntarily 
organized communities to create the physical, social, and moral envi~ 
ronments that their members want. 
There is increasing evidence that communities with a c_haotlc diver-
sity of social norms do not function very well, Some of t his evidence 
comes from studies of ethnically diverse communiJ:ies, r mention this 
evidence not because I think ethnic diversity is bad, but because it is 
one of the only proxles for social·norm diversity that has been studied 
so far. 
For example, the political scientist Rohert Putnam has found that 
American communities with higher levels of etbnic diversity tend to 
have lower levels of "social capital"-trust, altruism, cohesion, and 
sense of community, He and his colleagues analyzed data from thirty 
thousanJ people across forty-one U,S, communities, and found that 

298 
S PEN T 
people who live in communities with higher ethnic diversity (meaning, 
in the United States, more equal mIxtures of black, Hispanic, white, 
and Asian citizens) lend to have lower: 
• trust across ethnic groups 
• trust within their own ethnic group 
• community solidarity and cohesion 
.. community cooperatIon 
• sense of political empowennent 
• confidence in local government and leaders 
• voter registration rates 
• charity and volunteering 
.. investment in common goods 
• interest in maintaining community facilities 
• rates of carpooling 
• numbers of friends 
• perceived quality of life 
• general happiness 
These effects remained substantial even after controlling for each 
individual's age, sex, education, ethnicity, income, and language, and 
for each community's poverty rate, income ineguality, crime rate, pop-
ulation denSity, mobility, and average education. Putnam did not set 
out to look for 
effects; a great advocate of both social capital and 
diversity, he seems ta have been appalled at these results, and pub-
lished them only reluctantly, Many other researchers have reported 
similar findings. 
I suspect that these corrosive effects of "ethnic diversity" on social 
capital are not really an effect of ethnidty per se, but of each ethnic-
iry's having different social norm$~different dialects, values, politi-
cal attitudes, rehgions, social assumptions, and systems of etiquette. 
As Robert Kurzban and his collaborators have shown, ethnicity fades 
into the background when people feel motivated to cooperate with one 
another for the common Rood, based on ,h,,[('<1 i ntcrests a nd norms, 
The Will to Display 
299 
Communities without a coherent set of social norms just don't feel 
much like communities at all, so people withdraw from communit), 
life into their own families and houses. 
Sadly, it has become ahnost impossible now for like·minded people 
to arrange to live together in a small community with cohesive social 
norms. Real norms can be sustained effectively only by selecting who 
moves in, by praising or punishing those who uphold or violate nOrms 
as residents, and by expelling those who repeatedly violate the norms . 
These are the reguirements to sustain the type of cooperation called 
network reciprocity, in which cooperators form local "network dus-
ters" (communities) in which they help one another, Current laws in 
most developed cOllntries make network reciprocity almost impossi-
ble. Black MusHm property developers cannot set up gated commu-
nities that exclude white oppressors. Lesbians who were traumatized 
by childhood sexual abuse or rape cannot set up male·free zones. 
Pentecostals cannot exclude Satonists and \,Viccans from their neigh-
borhoods. Medical·marijuana lIsers with cancer or glaucoma cannot 
set up cannabis-friendly lones Polyamorous swingers cannot exclude 
monogamous puritans, or vice versa. 
So, while modern multicultural communities may be very free at 
the level of individual lifestyle choice, they are very 
at the Jevel 
of allowing people to creale and sustain distinctive local community 
norms and values. This is actually a bad thing, liberal ideologies not· 
Withstanding. It means that the only way to have any influence aver 
who your neighbors are, and how they behave, is to rent or buy at a 
particular price point, to achieve economic stratification. Antidis-
crimination laws apply, de facto, to everything except income, with the 
result that we have low-income ghettos, working-class tract houses, 
profeSSional (',xurbs. a fonn of assortative liVing by income, which cor-
relates only moderately with intelligence and conscientiousness. 
Moreover, when economic stratification ;s the only basis for choos-
ing where to live, wealth becomes reified as the central fODn of status 
in every community-the lowest common denominator of human vir-
ltle, the only lmil-dis!'lay Rame in town. Since you end up l1ving next

to people who might well respect wildl)' different intellectual, political, 
social, and moral values, the only way to compete for status is through 
conspicuous consumption. Grow a greener lawn, buy a bigger caT, add 
a medm room. If a Pentecostal lives next to a polyamorist, the only way 
they can compete with each other is at the default economic level of 
wealth display. But if all the Pentecostals lived together, they could 
establish new social norms that renounce such wealth displays, and 
compete for status through Bible-quoting, speaking in tongues, and 
spreading the gospel. And if all the polyamorists Ilved together, they 
could compete for status through good conversation, great sex, mini-
mal jealousy, maximal affection, and "matlonal authenticity. In both 
cases, their local social nOrmS could rein in runaway consumption, and 
shift their lime and energy to other activities that are more congruent 
with their most f,mdamental values. 
This idea~-the freedom to live near folks with shared values-may 
sound radical to members of the educated Euro-American elite, who 
tend to take multiculturalism, diversity, and tolerance for granted as 
good things. But it would sound perfectly sensible to almost any of 
our ancestors from any well· functioning culture in any epoch of his-
tory. It's called choosing}'OUf tribe: you have to be able to control who 
enters your community, and under what conditions they will be exiled. 
The efficiency and cohesiveness of local social life demands protec-
tion 
outside threats and internal selfishness. Minimallv this 
, ' 
requires that everyone local shares ru les of etiquette for avoiding con-
flict, a common spoken language for resolving conflict, norms govern-
ing social, se.xual, parental, kin. and economic-exchange relationships, 
and norms for coordinating group action, especialJy in emergencies. 
Strangely, many "communities" in developed nations lack these basic 
prereqUisites for living together. These communities function like 
computers that have hardware (a physical location and infrastructure) 
and an operating system (a government, an economic system, and a 
set of metanorms concerning tolerance and diversity), but no software 
applications (no specific social norms governing tmit display and sta-
tus seeking in any domams other than wcnith). 
The Will to D;sploy 
301 
To a limited degree, people with shared values and lifestyles can 
sometimes coordinate their movements into particular locations. 
American gay men often move to San Francisco or New York. Mor-
mons often congregate in Utah. But they arc always mixed up with 
others hostile to their values; they must rub elbows with homophobes 
or atheists, and they cannot do anything a.bout it. Under some spe-
cial circumstances, people can creme co-living communities with a 
limited set of shared rules that constrain rurmway consumerism. col-
lege fraternities and sororities, communes, cooperative hODsing, con-
dominium governing by internal 
and managerial boards, gated 
communities with restrktive covenants. However, the antidiscrimina-
tion laws still apply-these co-living systems still cannot legally select 
or expel memb€rs On the basis of sexual orientation or religion, which 
doesn't help gay men Or Mormons create their own communities, and 
it still leaves wealth display as the default basis for social status. 
So, governments should give people the freedom to create local 
housing communities with the power 10 sustain their own social 
norms, as long as a few basic human rights are respected. Adults must 
be free [0 move away from a community they don't like. The punish-
ment for violating social norms must not exceed temporary ostracism 
or permanent exile. As John Stuart Mill argued, children must not be 
subject to abuse that is permanently physically or mentally disabling 
(such as, arguably, circumcision, clitoridectomy, religiolls indoctrina-
tion, or anorexia-inducing ballet lessons), Clearly, it is hard to draw 
the line between normal acculturation and disabling child abuse, but 
that has always been true, and I can't offer a panacea. CMlization pro-
gresses in part through people arguing about these issues and reach-
ing the most enlightened, provisional, pragmatic consensus that they 
can achieve within their culture. At any rate, the government still has 
a crucial role to play in protectmg the oppressed or vulnerable from 
the tyranny of the majority, even within the most radical of the local 
communities. However, if the local majority cannot impose some dis-
tinctive social norms on our forms of trait signaling, conspicuous con-
sumption will remain the only game in town.

Apart from new ways of acquiring 
displaying real phYSical goods, 
human trait display is being revolutionized by three new forms of elec-
tronic communication: mobile phones (2 billion active users globally 
as of mid-200S), social-networking sites such as MySpace and Face-
book (each with 120 million users), and massively multiplayeronline 
games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft (10 million users) and 
Second Life (2 million users). These are not just new forms of com-
munication and entertainment. Viewed more broadly as part of the 
"Web 2,0," they are b""aking down the geographical and legal barri-
ers that have traditionally constrained people's abilities to form

x causes the change_ By contrast, the social sciences have always been

We can overcome this prohlem to some degree by allowing people 

306 
S PEN T 
to form a great diversity of like-minded communities, each of 
has cohesive social norms. One huge benefit of legalizing such diver-
sit)' is that we might learn what really makes communities work. 'We 
can compare different criteria of success across different communities 
and see what succeeds and what fails. The criteria can be as diverse as 
we like: measured levels of happiness, peacefulness, social connect-
edness, trait,d,splay efficiency, cultural vibrancy, technical progress, 
economic well,being, environmental sustainability, whatever. 'The 
greater the number of different 
the more diverse their 
norms, and the belter the data about their outcomes, the faster we'll 
learn what kinds of social norms and institutions allow people and 
communities to flourish. 
Of course, we still cant randomly assign people to communities; 
that would be unethicaL But by maximizing the freedom that indi-
viduals and families have to choose their own communities, we can 
minimize a lot of the usual "confounds" that have made it difficult to 
interpret cross,cultural differences. For example, in traditional soci' 
eties, a local population's culture (including social norms and insti-
tutions) is almost always confounded with 
population's genetic 
composition, demographic structure, 
of economic development, 
and ecological context, If one population is thriving and another is 
failing, it is virtually impossible to tell whether the outcome is due to 
differences in culture, genetics, wealth, or environment. By maximiz, 
social and geographical mobility, we can better see the signal of 
culture through the noise of those confounds. So, we wouldn't have 
a true experimental design v,rith true random assignment, but we'd 
have what behavioral scientists call a quasi-experimental design-not 
nearly as good, but much better than what we have available now. 
To infer causality in quaSi experiments, it helps to measure as many 
possible confounds as possible, so we can statistically control for their 
effects. To assess how well a community is functioning with a particu, 
lar set of social norms, it would be crucial to measure 
distribution 
of the Central Six traits among its inhabitants. Almost any community 
can succeed, regardless of its social norms, if it only admits hi~hly 
The Will to Di.ploy

intelligent, conscientious, agreeable, stable people. Almost any com, 
munity will fail if it excludes all such people. To make fair comparisons 
across communities, we need to know 
kind of people they con' 
tain, so we can tease out the effects of the social norms themselves. 
The result would be a Grand Social Quasi Experiment. Society 
itself would become our laboratory, and we would learn much more 
effectively what makes communities succeed or tHiL That knowledge 
v"ould spread, and in the long run, communities would imitate the 
social norms, institutions, designs, and aspects of culture that work 
elsewhere. Successful cultural features would spread, mutate, recom, 
evolve at the socialleve!. Failures would die out This would 
to an especially fast and effective fann of'cultural group selec, 
tion," as the anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Riche<son 
it. 
One nice thing about cultural group selection is that 
cultures 
can spread from population to population without the people them, 
selves colonizing or killing one another. Another nice thing about cuI, 
tural group selection is that we do not na\·c to 
that we already 
know what kinds of social norms, institutions, and designs work Vile 
don't have to do social engineering that is centralized, compulsory, or 
arrogant, like the grand experiments of twentieth,century totalitari, 
anism. We can be humble, let people experiment with their social 
arrangements, observe the results, and embrace what works. In other 
words, we can recognize that cultural evolution, like biological evolu-
tion, is much smarter than we are.

legalizing freedom 
CHANGING INFORMAL SOCIAL NORMS is usually the most effec-
tive way to change human behavior. This can often be accomplished 
without any change in government policies, programs, taxes, or laws. 
But sometimes, existing features of formal government impose per-
verse incentives that limit people's freedom to change old sodal 
norms-especially the norms that govern social and sexual signaling. 
This chapter considers some ways that citizens could encourage their 
governments to change the nature of consumerism-not by outlaw-
ing conspicuous consumption, but by 
its many alternatives to 
flourish more easily. That is, government policies don't need to actively, 
discourage conspicuous consumption. They just need to stop unwit-. 
tingly (or intentionaUy) promoting conspicuous consumption by con-: 
straining human choices and relationships. 
i 
One problem with most current governments is that they prioritize, 
economic growth (as mismeasured by GDP per capita) over citizens'-
happiness, quality of life, efficiency of trait display, and breadth anel 
depth of social networks. The latter outcomes are not actuaUy any:. 
harder to measure than GDP per capita. For example, the UN Huma.r:i 
Development Index (HOI) measures overall quality of life fairly wel!l 
by taking into account hfe expectancy, literacy, and educational attain'1 
mont; this index puIS Iceland, Norway, Australia, and Canada at the·1 
top, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the bottom. EveI'! 
the World Bank now encourages coumries to measure the value of 
"ecosystem services," "natural capita!," "social capita!," education, l1nd 
knowledge. Yet even the most comprehensive measures of life quality 
still tend to overlook some key variables, such as average numh", of 
hours worked per year {eighteen hundred fOT the United States and 
legalizing Freedom 
309 
Japan versus fourteen hundred for Germany, France, Norway, and the 
Netherlands). 
However, these nonmonetary outcomes just don't produce tax ,·ev-
enue to support government bureaucracies and politicians' Own vain-
glorious trait displays, such as hospitals named after ministers, and 
aircraft carriers pimped out as victory-speech platforms. So, Bhutan 
remains the only nation on earth to prioritize explicitly Gross National 
Happiness over Gross Domestic Product. Since governments have 
incentives to maximiz,€: tax revenue, they also have incentives to bjas 
the kinds of trait displays that their citizens use toward those that 
require paid employment and consumer spending. So, if you want to 
understand how political power bia.ses the trait-display systems of our 
society, you have to tTack the money on which politics depends: taxa-
lion to support the government, and campaign finance to support the 
individual politicians. These are the key points of democratic leverage 
where citizens can enact policy changes that free everybody to ,lisplay 
their traits in more diverse and more accurate ways. 
From Income Taxes to Consumption Taxes 
You may think that tax policy sounds like the most boring topic in 
the world. That is precisely what most governments, corporations, and 
special interests would like you to think, because tax policy is where 
much of society and the economy gets shaped. It is also where well-
infonned citizens can achieve socioeconomic revolutions \I/ith aston-
ishing speed and effe<.1:iveness-but only if they realize how much 
power they might wield in this domain. if citizens don't understand 
taxes, they don'l understand how, when, and where their government 
expropriates money, time, and freedom from their jives. They also 
don't understand how most governments bias consumption over sav-
ings, and bias some forms of consumption over other forms, thereby 
distorting the trait-display systems that people might otherwise favor. 
One strange aspect of taxation is the pervasive mismatch between 
what governments do 8nd what {'XPCrlS recommend. in most developed 

310 
S PEN T 
countries, including the United Stales and the United Kingdom, gov-
ernments rely mostly on income taxes. However, most people who have 
thought hard about tax policy-ranging from conservative economists 
to eeo-actlvists-favor consumption taxes. The sales tax levied by 
most U.S. states is a simple example of a consumption tax: consum-
ers pay an extra 4-8 percent on top of most retail purchases, which 
goes to the state government. The value-added tax (VAT) favored in 
Europe is a slightly more complex consumption t<LX that is levied not 
just on retail purchases by individual consumers, but on all transac-
tions throughout the supply chain, from mining and manufacturing 
through distribution and retail. 
Virtually all economists agree 
consumption taxes, compared 
with income taxes, encourage 
consuming but more earning, sav~ 
iug, investing, and charitable giVing. By making consumption relatively 
more expensive, consumption taxes make all these other activities 
relatively 
expensive. so people tend to shift their money from 
consumption to the other act!Vities. Thus, consumption taxes tend 
to reduce conspicuous consumption and promote longer-term retire-
ment 
family wealth, social welfare, technical progress, and 
economic growth, In essence, income taxes penalize people for what 
they contribute to society (labor and capital), whereas consumption 
taxes penalize people for what they take alit of society (new retail pur-
chases), So, to tax experts, it is no surprise that U.S. and U.K. citizens 
spend too much and don't save enough, relative to what would be opti-
mal for society and even for themselves_ The problem is not just that 
consumers Jack moral self-restraint at the individual level, but that 
citizens face perverse economic incentives at the aggregate leveL 
IVlost Eastern European countries (such as Ukraine, LatvJa, Serbia, 
and Romania) already switched to consumption taxes in the 19905, 
with largely positive results. ]\iIost \Vestern European countries, plus 
Japan, already levy some sort of VAT that functions as a consumption 
lax_ A U.S. consumption tax has been advocated by the economists 
Alan Greenspan and Robert Frank, and by the FairTax organization. 
Faiifax suggests a simple, ,'isible, federal retail.salcs tax (of about

On all retail purchases of new goods or services by individ-
ual conSUmerS at the point and time of sale. Its proposal would abolish 
all federal personal and corporate income taxes, and all gift, estate, 
capital gains, alternative minimum, Social Security, Medicare, and 
self-employment taxes. It would be a mildly progressive tax, giving a 
'"prebate" to ensure that nO One below the poverty level pays the tax. It 
would also raise revenue more fairly from illegal immigrants and tour-
ists (who do not file tax returns but do buy dungs), and underground-
economy workers (such as burglars, prostitutes, and babysitters, all of 
whom typically underreport their income but who cannot hide their 
retail purchases). 
More conservative analysts tend to favor a flat tax-a fix.ed percent 
of the yearly difference between one's income and one's consumer 
spending (excluding all savings, investments, and charitable dona-
tions). Either the FairTax or the flat tax would be simple to implement 
and easy to understand, and would save hundreds of billions of dollars 
in tax-compliance costs. 
The economist Robert Frank has suggested a more steeply progres, 
sive consumption tax. This would be administered like the flat tax, 
but the percent paid would increase with 
individual's net con-
sumption, minus a moderate deduction for basic living costs (around 
$30,000 for a family of four), The consumption tax would start at a 
low rate such as JO percent, but would gradually 
as a family's net 
consumption increased, to a top 
rate of about 100 percent 
for families who spend morc than $10 million per year, Robert Frank's 
reasoning, like mine, is that many purchases function as positional 
goods that displav one's wealth, statlls, or personality traits rather than 
yielding true happiness benefits or fitness payoffs to the purchaser. 
(''Tme happiness" here has the uncontentioliS meamng of "subjective 
well-heing" or "overall life satisfaction:' as it can be measured reliably 
and validly with many different questionnaires.) For big spenders seek-
ing high status through consllmptlon, even a very high consumption 
tax rate would not actually decrease their happiness or their fitness.

For consumption taxes collected at the place and time of retail sale, 
it would be easy to charge different tax rates on 
kinds of 
goods and services. ft might be fair and reasonable to impose a higher 
consumption tax rato on products that impose higher "negative exter-
nalities' (costly side effects) on society and tbe environment, so gov-
ernment programs can offset those side effects. for example, if a $1 
pack of 
imposes about $6 of additional costs On a country's 
nationalized health care system, to cover the expenses of caring for 
the increased number of lung cancer and emphysema cases, then the 
consumption tax on cigarettes should be 600 percent, (Currently, U.S. 
states 
a consumption tax to cover the higher health-care costs 
for smokers, but this tax ranges from only S.lS per twenty-cigarette 
pack in MissiSSippi to $2.58 in New Jersey) Such a tax could reduce 
the long-term health-care com of smoking, especially in large poor 
countries, slieh as China (where 65 percent of meo-420 milhon-
smoke) and India (where 45 percent of men-250 n>illion-smoke). 
That's L3 billion lungs regularly "xposed to carcinogens. 
As another example, jf a $1 pineapple is transported two thou-
sand miles by truck on federal highways, and imposes $2 of wear and 
tear on the nation's transport infrastructure, its consumption tax rate 
should be 200 percent-much higher than for a locally grown apple 
or avocado. Conversely, socially and ecologically innocuous products 
(such as bicycles, universities, and 
downloads) might pay much 
lower consumption tax rates. 
Before barcodes, laser scanners, and computerized inventory systems, 
it would have been impractical for retailers to charge product-specific 
consumption tax rates. Now each product !ype could hc assi)',n('d !o a

certain consumption tax rate by federal government economists, on the 
basis of real data concerning externalities, and this tax rate would autO-
matically be imposed as cashiers scan the item or charge for the service. 
Any products that yield "positive externalities" (whose acquisition 
and use actually saves resources for government, society, and the envi-
ronment) might be subject to a negative consumption tax rate (effec-
tively, a government subsidy). These positive-externality products 
might include home insulation (to minimize global warming), airbags 
retrofitted to older cars (to minimize costly injuries), and vocational 
training (to minimize unemployment), 
At the other extreme, the consumption tax rate should be very, 
very high for any products that impose massive negative externali-
ties. Consider handgun ammuninon. Currently, one can buy five hun-
dred rounds of 9 mm ammunition for about $110 from online u.s. 
retailers-about twenty-two cents each, But each round of ammuni· 
tion has a slight chance of falling into the wrong hands and killing 
someone. How slight) About 10 billion rounds are sold per year in the 
United States. There are about thirty thousand gun-related deaths in 
Umted States per year (including suicides, homicides, and acci-
dents), Assuming the typical gun death jnvo],'es one round of ammo, 
the chance that any given round will end up killing someone is about 
thirty thousand divided by 10 billion, Or three per miHion. Now, a per-
son's life is general1y reckoned to be warth about 
million, according 
to the usual cost-benefit-risk analyses by highway engineers, airlines, 
and hospitals, If each bullet has a three per million chance of 
!ng a $3 million life, then that bullet imposes an expected average 
cost On society of $9. That's about forty times its conventional retail 
cost of $0,22, so, by my reasoning, it should be subject to a consump-
tion tax rate of 4,000 percent. This is obviously a rough calculation; it 
ignores the injury costs of nonlethal shootings (which would increase 
the tax) and the crime-deterrence effects, if any, of citizens having 
ammo (which would decrease the tax). In any case, the five-hundred-
round box of ammo should eost about $4,500, not $JlO. 
Such.1 high tax rotc would in no way undermine the sacred Second 

314 
S PENT 
Amendment, which the National Rifle Association holds so dear. 
People eoold still have the right to keep and bear arms, but would 
simply have to pay society the true expected costs that their danger-
ous hobby imposes on others. They could pay $4,500-more than one 
month's median U.s. household income-for a five-hundred-round 
box of ammo for "recreational shooting." If they're unwilling to pay that 
much, they should offer a principled argument for why the rest of us 
should subsidize the aggregate social, economic, medical, and funeral 
costs of their avocation. 
Similar arguments might apply to motorcycles and pit bulls (both 
of which maim and kill their owners at ghastly rates). The consump-
tion tax rate should also be high for service industries that impose 
costly side effects on soclety in the form of obesity (fast-food restau-
ranis), noise pollution (concrete demolition), or false hope that delays 
medical or psychiatric treatment (purveyors of Christian Science, Sci- . 
entology, homeopathy, or Vibrating phytoplankton). Yes, people should 
be free to choose the level of physical risk they wish to impose on 
themselves, but they should pay steeply for the likely social costs if the 
risks are very hlgh, 
By this reasoning, a product-specific consumption tax would allow 
governments to legalize a much wider range of goods and services, 
Most products that are illegal somewhere (drugs, prostitution, trans-
fatty acids) are outlawed because regulators assume that they impose 
unacceptable externalities on society (add.iction, AIDS, obesity). If 
evidence-based consumption taxes negated the true costs of these 
externalities, the main economic and moral reason for outlawing such 
products would evaporate. The world's most influential regulators (who 
are now in Brussels rather than vVashington) could focus on minim",-
ing harm from the truly dangerous products and business practices. 
Drawing the True Cost Map 
It would present a great challenge to determine the appropriate con-
sumption tax rate for each product category, and to do so bascd on 
legalizing Freedom 
315 
legitimate empirical research rather than ideology. J:or many product 
categories, governments and environmental activlsts might try to max-
imize the applicable consumption tax rate, while marketers would try 
to minimize it. At first, only the most obvious social coslll-heBlth 
care, transport, pollution-could be estimated in dollar-per-product 
terms. Quantifying the average long-term health-care costs to the user 
of smoking a pack of cigarettes would be much easier than quantifying 
the costs of the secondhand smoke. Quantifying the highway-repair 
costs of transporting each pineapple two thousand miles would be 
much easier than quantifying the alleged patriarchy-reinforcing, rape-
promoting effects of each pornographic magazine. 
A vast amount of new SCientific research wou ld need to be done on 
product-specific externalities, and that research would have to be very 
carefully funded, analyzed, and interpreted. There would be ubiqui-
tous confounds and complexities-maybe fatter people tend to smoke 
more, and the fat, rather than the smoke, is contributing to lung can-
cer. Maybe low-agreeableness males tend to buy porn more often, and 
also commit more rapes, but perhaps the porn doesn't cause the rapes. 
Ideally, the externahty measurements would use the same sort of ran· 
domized trials now used to determine the safety and efficacy of clini-
cal drugs. This would require a radical change in the government's 
mind-set--from arrogantly assuming that we know how policies will 
influence behavior to humbly realizing that we need to run sodal 
experiments to determine their effects. 
For instance, if we really want to know whether soda consumption 
increases obesity and diabetes rates, we could run a study usmg the 
consumption tax itselF. The soda consumption tax rate could be set 
at a wide range of different random levels (so that a can of soda could 
cost anywhere from $25 to $50) in several thousand different towns 
and cities. Given sufficient policing to minimize the resulting hlack 
market in untaxed soda, higher tax rates would reduce soda sales, so 
would lead to different soda consumption tates in different areas~ By 
recording those consumption rates and obesity and d>abetes rates in 
each arca for sevcrnl years, we could see exactly how much each can 

316 
S PEN T 
of soda increases the average obesity and diabetes rates, and result, 
illg health care costs. The soda consumption tax rate could then be 
set accordingly. It may sound coldhearted to run such studies, which 
in effect cast soda drinkers as guinea pigs. However, tms is exactly 
the data needed to settle the debate that has been raging since the 
1970s between anti'soda activists and soda manufacturers. Both 
groups, insofar as they have any intellectual integrity, should want bet, 
ter causal data on the issue, and the only way to obtain that data is 
through this sort of randomized study. Once a few such studies across 
different countries are published, the issue would be resolved. 
Skeptics might object that to set appropriate product'specific can' 
sumption tax rates would require a vast new government bureaucracy. 
VVe ",.1Quld need thousands of economists, statisticians, actuaries, and 
psychologists to measure all the externalities, risks, and costs of every 
product class. That is true, but that is precisely what we need: good 
solid data about the true social and environmental costs of the goods 
and services we buy. If we don't collect and analyze such data. all argu' 
ments about the social and environmental effects of different policies 
are just blather. They can't be evidence, based if there is no e\~dence. 
As a government project, a massive scientific initiative to gather 
evidence about conslill1ption externalities doesdt sound as exciting 
as an Apollo program to send a man to the moon. However. it might 
give us a much greater long-term payoff: an accurate map of how our 
consumer decisions aFfect our society and environment. \Ne could call 
it something catchy, like the True Cost Map, rather than something 
bureaucratic, like the Evidence,Based International Reference Matrix 
of Product,Specific Externalities (EBlRMOPSE for short?). Develop' 
ing the True Cost Map would have many other benefits, such as gi\~ng 
meaningful work to thousands of underemployed social scientists who 
would otherwise run around teaching the VVrong Radical Model to 
gullible undergraduates. 
Garrett Hardjn's "tragedy of the comrnons" arises whenever peo-
ple don't have to pay for the true externalities that their consumption 
choices impose on others. However, when people arc responsible for 
Legalizing Freedom 
317 
sucb payments, their consumption choices become aligned almost 
perfectly with the interests of society at large. If fish consumers had 
to pal' the true full price that their fish eating imposes on endangered 
stocks, overllshing would be automatically reduced. Ideally, the can, 
sumption tax on each class of products should be used to offset the 
specific externalities imposed by that class of product. In reducing the 
tragedy of the commons effect, it doesn't really matter whether the 
consumption tax dollars are collected and burned, or collected and 
spent on useful social and em~ronmental programs. The latter seems 
lTlore sensible though. 
To conservatives and libertarians, such a consumption-tax system 
may sound like a nightmarish new way for the government to interfere 
with the free market. In practice, it would severely restrict the gov' 
ernment's power to meddle. Suppose product'specific tax rates were 
required to be based on rigorous empirical evidence concerning exter-
nalities. Then governments could only impose higher,than'minimum 
rates on products that demonstrably impose costs on other people and 
on their environment. Even the most ardent libertarians, such as Rob-
ert Nozick. have recognized the need for a "night watchman state" that 
protects people's lives and property from other people's bad behavior. 
Laws against murder and robbery are, from an economist's vie\vpoint, 
simply ways of deterring people from imposing negative externalities 
such as death or property loss on others. Product'specific consump' 
tion tax rates would silnply deter conswners from imposjng other sorts 
of negative externalities (such as pollution, highway wear and tear, and 
risks of getting shot) on others. 
,'\ll negative externalities are, by definition, encroachments on 
other people's lives and property. So, even hard'core libertarialJs who 
believe that governments should do nothing more than protect people 
from such encroachments should be willing to accept a consumption 
tax specifically designed to counteract such encroachments. From this 
viewpoint, the consumption tax is not paternalistic meddling. Rather, 
it is a classical "Pigovian tax" designed to correct the negative exter, 
nalities of market activity, i)ctnOCr;'ltle govcrnmcnts arc, mnong othC'r 

SPENT 
things, ways for people to manage the externalities of human economic 
behavior in free markets, From that perspective, it seems reasonable 
that governments should impose consumption taxes designed to neu-
tralize each product type's externalities, In other words, we should be 
free to choose what we buy and how we live, as long as we pay the fair 
pnce for every harm we do to others in the process, 
Promoting Product Longevity 
Consumption taxes could help solve another problem with modern 
consumerism. At the moment, corporations can often maximize long' 
run sales through planned obsolescence and shoddy build quality, If 
you're a mop maker, YOLI get a fourfold-higher revenue stream from 
selling plastic-handled mops that cost $8 and break "~thin two years 
(yielding $4 per year in sales per customer), rather than steel,handled 
mops that Cost $J2 and last twelve years (yielding $1 per year), The 
environmental costs of making each mop might be similar-perhaps 
each imposes $4 of ealernalities, But the plastic-handled mops need 
replacing six times as often, so over a mop user's lifetime, the use of 
plastic-handled mops wil1 impose those $4 externalities six times as 
often, 
consumption tax rate imposed on a product category could 
be scaled up for products of lower build quality that depreciate faster, 
break faster, and need replacement more often. For example, steel, 
handled mops might pay only one-sixth the consumption tax rate of 
plastic-handled mops-perhaps a rate of 12 percent rather than 72 
percent. Thus, the steel-handled mop's total price would be $12 pillS 
12 percent, or $13.44, whereas the plastic,handled mop's total price 
would be $8 plus 60 percent, or $13,76, The sensible consumer would 
then buy the steel-handled mop because it's cheaper, even ifhe wasn't 
aware of the different build qualities, average breakage rates, and 
expected replacement rates, 
These depreciation-sensitive consumption tax rates could apply 
to much costlier goods that impose much heavier externalities, and 
the benefits to society and the environment would be even greater, 
legalizing freedom 
319 
For instance, consider two midsize SUVs that cost about $29,000: 
the Toyota Highlander and the Ford Explorer. Suppose for the sake 
of argwnent that the Highlander is designed to run for an average of 
240,000 miles before it wears out, whereas the Explorer is deSigned 
to run for an average of only 120,000 miles. It might make Sense to 
charge twice the consumption tax rate on the Explorer (maybe 40 
percent instead of 20 percent), because habitual Explorer buyers will 
have to buy new vehicles twice as often as habitual Highlander buyers, 
Consumers would then face a choice between a $34,800 Highlander 
($29,000 plus 20 percent) and a $40,600 Explorer ($29,000 plus 40 
percent). This would make reliability djfferences more salient to con, 
sumers, and would shift buying patterns from more-disposable prod, 
ucts to longer-lasting ones, 
Depreciation'sensitive rates woold be even more important and 
beneficial in the housing market. In 1997 we bought a house in Red, 
hill, England, that was built in 1898, It had solJd brick walls, thick roof 
tiles, and sturdy woodwork, and was apparently designed to last about 
two hundred years, In 2001 we moved to Albuquerque and shopped 
for houses, The 1950s fIrst-generation suburban houses were fairly 
wen built (cinder,block walls, oak floors, caved plaster ceilings), so 
we bought one of Ihose, However, the new houses all seemed to be 
built from chopsticks and cardboard: walls of half-inch gypsum board 
nailed onto widely-spaced two-by-fours, floors of nylon carpet above 
oriented-strand board, flat roofs of lar paper and gril, thinly sprayed 
stucco siding, hollow-core doors, and plastiC bathtubs. They are appar-
ently designed to last about ten years, and everybody knows il:, which 
is why they are sold as "used" houses after five years of all-too-visible 
depredation. [f consumption tax rates on new houses were much lower 
for better-built hOllses with greater expected longevity, such rickety 
abominaticns would never be built. Developers might not use solid 
brick walls as they did in 1898 Engl8nd, but they might invent some-
thing even longer lasting. We could take our inspiration from the Clock 
of the Long Now project, which ai.ms to build a mechanical clock on 
a Nevada mountaintop that will keep time for ten thousand years, We

S PE N T 
want developers to build houses that our grandchildren could inherit, 
so thel' need not spend their lives paying a mortgage on yet another 
generation of misconceived shacks, \,Ve might even consider arrang-
ing economic incentives so we can enjoy built environments that age 
gracefully through hundreds of years, like Umbrian villas Or Oxford 
rectories, ks the least we can do for fmure generations, 
Good design can minimize depreciation even for more transient 
goods, such as clothes. The mainstream fashion industry intentionally 
produces dothes with extreme and quirky designs and colors so they 
can be rendered aesthetically obsolete more easily the follOWing year, 
when the new design features are decided at Paris Fashion Week, 
and the new colors are ''forecast'' b\, the Inter-Society Color Council 
and other trendsetters, By comrast, the new trend for "eeo"fashion" 
by designers such as Rebecca Earley ("Green is the new black") aims 
to create attractive clothes that are both physically and aesthetically 
durable. They are produced from sustainable, nonpolluting sources 
(organic cotton, rayon, or hemp rather than conventionally grown cot-
lon, which requires high pesticide use), and are designed to resist and 
hide stains from spills, dirt, and sweat, and to require lower· energy 
washing, faster drymg, and no ironing. Eco-fashion uses more classi-
cally appealing designs and colors that cannot be rendered obsolete as 
easH)" and so arguably should be subject to a lower consumption tax 
than extreme high fashion of the sort that dominates Vogue and 111 
Style. 
It would be a bit tricky to implement a consumption tax that was 
both differential (based on product-specific externalities and depre-
ciation rates) and progressive (based on the purchaser's annual total 
consumption), The differential consumption tax (with different rates 
for different products) is collected most easily at the point and time of 
sale by the retailer. By contrast, the progressive consumption tax is col-
lected most easily if people file an annual tax return that reports the 
difference between their total income and their total savings and char-
itable giving. Some ingenuity would be rcqu ired to develop a practica I, 
secure mcthod of collecting a diffNcnlinl, ptORressive conslI01l'1 ion 
legalizing freedom 
321 
tax at the point of retail sale. However, if we can invenl international 
computerized systems for managing cell"phone calls, uirline reserva-
tions, debit charges, and Amazon.com shipments, it seems likely that 
we could organize such a consnmption tax system. The technical chul-
lenges would be solvable, and the social and environmental benefits 
would be dramatic. 
What the Consumption Tax Might Accomplish 
Suppose we followed the experts' advice and derived all government 
revenue from a consumption tax averaging about 25 percent on all new 
retail purchases. How would this shift our consumer behavlOf and our 
social systems of trait display) 1 can see five major benefits. 
First, people would reduce, reuse, and recycle more, because only 
new fetai] purchases wouJd be taxed, There would be no consump-
tion tax on used items sold through the secondar), market, such as 
used cars, secondhand books, thrift-store clothing, antique furniture, 
or pre-owned houses, If you wanted a new-built house in a developer's 
new cxurban gated community, you would have to pay the consump-
tion tax on the full price of the house; whereas if you wanted to reno-
vate an older house in an established city or town, you would pay the 
consumption tax only on the building materials and labor costs. If you 
wanted the newest model of car, you would pay the conswnption tax 
on the car's full price, but if you were content with a used car that 
just needed some new tires, you would pay tax only on the tires. This 
would create incentives to make the best use of what previous gen-
erations have already built and produced. It would hugely expand the 
secondary market, and the seale and efficiency "-ith wh,ch used goods 
gel traded and used. Estate sales, yard sales, eBay, classified ads, and 
flea markets would flourish, The matter and energy that is invested in 
the production of physical objects would stay in circulation longer, and 
their ecological costs would be amortized over a much longer period. 
Second, the consumption tax would also create Incentives for peo-
pi" to buy long{'r-I;\stin~ ~o()ds tlmt have a higher resale value in the 

322 
S PEN T 
secondary market. They would be motivated to maintain and repair 
those goods more conscientiously, and to replace them 
often. If 
the old washing machine can be repaired with a new $20 part (plus 
$ 5 in tax) rather than replaced with a new washing machine for $ 500 
(plus 
in tax), people might opt for the repair more often, and 
see more clearly the absurdity of premature replacement We already 
saw how depreciation-sensitive consumption tax rates would Increase 
manufacturers' incentives to produce longer-lasting products. These 
other effects-consumers thinking ahead about product resale values 
and repairability-would aHow retailers to charge more for products 
that are easier to maintain, repair, upgrade, and redecorate, and so 
would further encourage the production of such items. 
Third, the consumption tax would encourage people to buy prod-
ucts that consume less energy and matter to operate. As gas, oil, char-
coal, electricity, batteries, water, printer ink cartridges, and coHee 
filters would all 
subject to the full consumption tax, consumers 
might prefer cars that get better mileage and printer cartridges that 
use ink more efficiently. The promotion of green buildmgs would be 
especially important. About 45 percent of the world's energy budget 
is used to heat and cool buildings (far more than to power all vehicles 
combined), but new materials and design methods can easily reduce 
building energy needs by about 80-90 percent. Currently, such 
energy efficiency is rarely maximized in new construction, because it 
costs about 15 percent more than energy-inefficient methods. How-
ever, as consumers realize how much they could save in highly taxed 
running costs by spending a tiny bit more up front, the profitability 
and popularity of energy· efficient building should grow_ Or, energy-
eHident buildings could simply be subject to a lower consumption tax 
rate. 
Fourth, the consumption tax would promote social capital and 
neighborly camaraderie. It would apply only to formal retail purchases, 
so it would push people to barter, borrow, and make more things them-
selves. Citizens would develop and use less-formal systems of trade, 
reciprocity, reputation, and trust. Friends would hal'(' higher incentives 
legalizing Freedom 
323 
to lend one another useful items, and to make one another more prac-
tical gifts. Neighbors would have higher incentives to trade mutuaJly 
useful services--babysitting, gardening, tutoring, carpooling, hOllse-
painting, barn raising---to avoid the consumption tax premium for for-
mally hired employees. To economists who believe that an atomistic 
division of labor in a formal job market necessarily yields the highest 
economic efficiency, this sort of informal service sector might sound 
horribly misconceived. But to most humans-members of a species 
evolved to flourish in small-scale societies built on mutual recognitlOn, 
respect. and trust-it might sound rather pleasant and fulfilling. 
Finally, the consumption tax would increase savings, investment, 
and charity. In effect. each dollar that an individual allocated to invest-
ment or charity would buy 25 percent more than each dollar allocated 
to consumption. Inve.strnent and charity could be made more salient 
in everyday life as signals of one's personal traits, through various new 
electronic databases, displays, and technologies. Then conspicuous 
consumption could easily fall from favor as tbe standard trait-display 
system. More matter, energy, time, and skill would be invested in the 
long-term infrastructure of civilization, and less in burning through 
short-term displays of conspicuous waste, precision, 
reputation. 
The Will to Change 
CiviLizations change most dramatically when their status-signaling 
systems change. Marx overlooked an important truth: the meanS of 
displa)', not just the means of production, are crucial factors in eco-
nomic and social revolutions. Signallng systems show strong lock-in 
effects: once a Signaling convention such as runaway consumerism 
gets established, it can be very bard for a population to shift to another 
set of conventions. The signalmg conventions start to look like an inev-
itable outcome of cosmic evolution, rather than a system of historically 
defined cultural norms. Conspicuous consumerism is neither natural 
nor inevitable, but just one possible mode of human trait display. 
Also, bCC(lUSC conspiC'lIoll$ consumerism requires an alienating 

324 
SPE NT 
suppression of many natural social instincts, it is especially poor at 
arming us with good indicators of some key personaljty traits such as 
agreeableness and consclentiousness" To display these traits, consum-
ers are slowly shifting from traditional conspicuous consumption to 
conspicuously ethical consumption" Highly agreeable and conscien-
tious consumers now try to buy recycled computer-printer paper at 
a 40 percent premium above virgin paper, or purchase shade-grown 
Fair Trade coffee at $12 a pound rather than "Val-Mart generic cof-
fee at $3 a pound" Conspicuously ethical consumption is certainly 
one potent way to improve the world I but there are even more revo-
lutionar}' possibilities" If we could find more efficient wars for peo-
ple to display their Central Six traits-especially agreeableness and 
conscientiousness-the social and environmental results could be 
even more positive. 
The last few chapters have outlined several ideas for shifting our 
trait-display system away from conspicuous consumption and toward 
other signaling games that are more natural, humane, efficient, accu-
rate, environmentally responsible, and fulfilling" The ideas may seem 
radleal, especially to Americans, who arc unaccustomed to reaJly 
sign ilk ant changes in socioeconomic polky" Other countries better 
appreCiate the potential speed and depth 
change" 10 the pa~t twenty 
years Europe has been transformed from a patchwork of ragged 
empire remnants imo the world's largest, richest, best-integrated econ-
omy" China, India, and Russia have abandonea socialist planning in 
favor of free markets and free traae" The number of countries with 
multiparty democracy has increased from less than fifty to more than 
eighty, There are now 6,7 billion people on earth" Half of them are 
under thirty-they had not yet r<".ached puberty when Bill Clinton was 
elected United Stales president, when Tony Blair was elected U"K. 
prime minister, or when Kurt Cobain killed himself. 
In the global long run, i1 doesn't much matter how the United 
States Or U"K change their consumption patterns, because their pop' 
ulations and economies are such a small and shrinking proportion of 
the entire world's" The twO countries that will maller most arc the 
legolizing Freedom 
325 
ones \\;th vast populations and fast-growing economies, namely China 
(13 billion people, 10 percent economic growth per year) and Inaia 
(LI billion people, 8 percent growth per year)" Those two countries 
still have a good chance to shift their tl1lit-display systems before con-
spicuous consumption becomes locked in as the cultural norm" 
Dramatic policy changes are much easier for China to accomplish, 
because its stronger central government is less constrained by the 
competing speCial-interest groups (ethnicities, religlOos, casles, lan-
guages) that characterize tIle feverish Indian democracy" For exam-
ple, from 1995 to 2007, China built about thirty thousand miles of 
expressways-about the same in a twelve-year period as the United 
States had built in the forty years after the Federal-Aid Highway Act 
was enacted in 1956" The CUITent "fourth-oeneration" Chinese leaders 
o 
arc mostly bright, practical-minded engineers, already keenly aware 
of the environmental and social costs of conspicuous consumption, 
Most of my key ideas-social norms favoring status through infonnal 
assessment of people's personal traits and moral \;rtues, better objec' 
tive psychometric testing for education and employment, a progres-
sive, product-specific consumption tax-would not undermine their 
political power or Chinas social stability, Indeed, many of them dove-
tail nicely with traditional Confucian ideals (respect for ment and 
\~rtue withm individuals, families, and states) and practices (such as 
the imperial civil service exams), and with communist principles (at 
least, at the abstract level of promoting the positive externalities and 
minimizing the negative externalitIes of social and economic activity)" 
They also fit well with China's strong new interest in building cco-
sustainable New Urbanist cities, such as Tangye New Town in Jinan 
Province" If China adopts such farSighted poliCies, and thrives, il will 
serve as an exciting new role model for other developing and developed 
nations, 
Despite India's more chaotic political system, it already shows 
thoughtful ambivalence about the idea of economic growth for its own 
sake, and an increasing detennination not to mimic the worst aspects 
of American-style conspicuous consumption, The older generation of 

326 
S PC NT 
Indian intellectuals still clings to the Nehru-era socialist ideals that 
imposed the lamentable "Hindu rate of economic growth" and delayed 
India's climb out of mass poverty from the 1940s th rough the early 
19905. However, those socialist ideals also undercut the reputabil-
ity of conspicuous consumption-as do the older traditions of Hindu 
asceticism, Buddhist nonattachment, and Muslim brotherhood. Many 
of the younger generation of Indian entrepreneurs obtained degrees 
and work experience in tbe United 
and Europe, and are fluent 
in English, the international language of both business and science. 
These younger entrepreneurs have seen both the social and cultural 
costs of runaway consumerism, and the ways that some countries have 
minimized those costs. Mony of them seem to 
setting a good exam-
ple by leapfrogging over conspicuous consumption straight to conspic-
uously ethical investment and charity, in just a single generation. It is 
crucial for India's YOW1ger generation to avoid viewing runaway can-
samerism as the only "modem" alternative to the stultifying traditions 
of religion, caste, patriarchy, socialism, and identity politics. 
Why the Sky Won't Fall If We Gently Shift 
Our Signaling Systems 
The changes suggested in the last few chapters might sound alanming to 
some. If people suddenly adopted product-specific consumption taxes, 
self-policing communities of like-minded citizens, and these other 
innovations, wouldn't some very bad things happen? If people bought 
fewer goods 
services, then cOnsumer demand "Quid shrink, sales 
volumes and prices would drop, unsold inventories would increase, 
supply chains would dog. companies would go bankrupt, factories and 
malls would shut, and unemployment would skyrocket. Then curren-
cies, equities, bonds, and real estate values would go into free fall, and 
investment bankers would fling themselves from tall buildings in New 
York, London, and Hong Kong. Tax revenues-whether from income, 
consumption. or investments-would evaporate. First recession, then 
depression, then economic collapse. TI,e next steps are predlctahle: 
legalizing Freedom 
327 
governments fall, police vanish, riots flare, anarchy spreads, services 
collapse, utilities fail, people starve, babies cry, gangs rape, plagues 
spread, warlords rise, armies clash, nukes explode. The misery would 
be long enough to cause h}'steria, and wide enough to cause great pain. 
Without conspicuous consumption to keep everyone busy, wouldn't 
we all end up living in an eeo-communo-primitivist dystOpia whether 
we wanted to or not? 'Wouldn't we go straight from American Beauty 
through American Psycho to Mad lVIa.x? 
Such 
would be reasonable if rhe changes happened foo quickly 
for markets, companies, and governments to adapt. Moon·size meteors 
are bad for biodiversity, because they kill too many species too quickly 
for evolutionary adaptation to compensate. (Remember the Permian-
Triassic extinction 251 million years ago that destroyed 96 percent of 
all sea species and 70 percent of aU land vertebrates? Oh, maybe not.) 
Likewise, short sharp shocks to the social norms governing our trait-
display systems can be bad for human societies--consider the 1789 
Revolution (outcome: Napoleon Bonaparte), 1917 Russian 
Revolution (outcome: Joseph Stalin), and 1994 Republican Revolution 
(outcome: Newt Gingrich). 
But over the longer term, economies are astonishingly resilient. 
Joseph Schwnpeter observed that economies actually thrive on the 
"creative destruction" sparked hy radical changes in technology and 
society. Other Austrian and Chicago School economists have empha-
siz.ed that free markets are the most ingenious, resourceful, and adap-
tive systems ever invented hy humans. Free markets embody the 
aggregate intelligence 
every buyer, seller, and innovator, and, like 
life itself, they always find a way forward. This isn't wishful think-
ing, it's historical fact. When hired shepherds were replaced by bor-
der collies, they become factory workers Buggy-whip makers morpn 
into bumper sticker deSigners. Medieval knights are rendered obsolete 
by the crossbow. but their male descendants may become Formula I 
drivers, navy pilots, or Segway enthUSiasts. Milkmaids are replaced 
by vacuum pulsation milking machines, but their female descendants 
may become software project managers or radio astronomers. The 

328 
S PEN T 
Ch~l War ends cotton-plantation slavery, but the South rises again by 
inventing Nascar and the Atlanta hip-hop scene, In each case, our 
ancestors could hardly have imagined the jobs people hold now, or the 
products they buy, or the ways they seek status. 
Whole sectors of the economy rise and fall, but the market lives 
on. Our ancestors survived vast economic disruptions without going 
extinct, adapting from hunter-gatherers to farmers and herders in the 
Neolithic Revolution, from peasants to factory workers in the Indus-
trial Revolution, and from thing makers to status purveyors and experi-
ence providers in the marketing revolution. Given historical precedent, 
the same creative destruction is likely to yield viable business, invest-
ment, and employment opportunities even jf conspicuous consump-
tion is replaced almost entirely by ethical consumption and ethical 
investment. We just have to preserve the institutional and cultural 
prerequiSites for free markets to work: peace, the ruJe of law, property 
rights, stable currency, efficient regulation, honest government, and 
social norms of truth, trust. fairness, and honor. I've heard that these 
prerequisites already exist in Hong Kong, Silicon Valley, and Switzer-
land, so they're clearly not unattainable, 
Conclusion: Self-Gilding Genes 
Consumerist capitalism is largely an exercise in gilding the lily, INc 
take wondrously adaptive capacities for human self-display· language, 
intelligence, kindness, creativlty, and beauty-and then forget how 
to use them in making friends, attracting rrultes, and gaining pres~ 
tige. Instead we rely on goods and services acquired through eduea" 
lion, work, and consumption to adverlise our personal traits to others. 
These costly signals are mostly redundant Or misleading, so others 
usually ignore them. They prefer to judge llS through natural face-to-
face interaction. We think our gilding dazzles them, though we ignore 
their own gilding when chOOSing our own friends and mates. 
This is an absurd way to live, but it's never too late to come away 
from ie We can find better ways to combine Ihe best features of pre-
legalizing Freedom 
329 
historic human life and modern life, Eco-communo-primitivism alone 
offers little more than squalor, ignorance, and horedom. Hunaway con-
sumerism alone offers little more Ihan narcissism, e.haustion, and 
alienation. We need the freedom to explore different ways of display-
ing Our traits to the people we care abouL We need to Icgtllize more 
diverse forms of trait display_ ,Ve need to switch from en Income tax 
that promotes short,term runaway consumption to a consumJllion tax 
that promotes longer-term ethical investment, charity, sodal <'apital, 
and neighborly warmth. 
Above all, we need the freedom to live assortatively with like~ 
minded people, and to establish a much wider variety of local commu~ 
nities with their own values and norms, sustained by their own forms 
of praise and punishment. Some communities may retain the focus on 
conspicuously amoral consumption. Some may shift to conspicuously 
ethical consumption Or conspicuously ethical investment I hope that 
eventually, most will invent systems of human trait display that we 
can't even imagine now, \Nhen people are free to move where they 
want, live as they want, and allocate their time, energy, and money 
to the trait displays they want, they will discover some fabulous new 
ways to live and display. Humans may never give up their drives for 
statllS, respect, prestige, sexual attractiveness, and social popularity, 
but these drives can be channelecl to yield a much higher quality of 
life than runaway consumerism offers. We can flaunt our fitness with 
more indivlduality, ingenuity, and enlightenment.

ableness, stability, extraversion). A percentile of 10 percent means 
only 10 percent of people would score lower On that trait than you; 
a percentile of 90 percent means thao 90 percent of people score 
lower than you. Then estimate these trait percentiles for each of thcse 
people; your three most recent sexual partners, three closest friends, 
three closest co-workers, and three nearest neighbors. For each person
