Maintaining the balance of clothing microclimate is critical for human health
management. An ideal smart textile should possess key characteristics such as
active thermoregulation, moisture permeability, and stable working perfor-
mance. However, such a fabric that encompasses all these capabilities is rarely
reported. Herein, we report a sustainable and durable bi-directional thermo-
regulation fabric (Bi-DTF) by hierarchical structural engineering strategy. This
advancement stems from the programmability of the molecular chains, aiming
to reduce chain aggregation, improve functional particle compatibility, and
build dynamic stress-dissipative networks, thus fully enhancing the robustness
of composite ﬁbrous membranes. The optimized Bi-DTF substantially elim-
inates the heat/cold irritation caused by environmental switching, featuring
high energy storage density (4.1 kJ m−2) and stable work performance even
after 50 standard washing cycles and 500 rubbing cycles. Compared with
commercial textiles, Bi-DTF offers a maximum thermal temperature difference
of only 2.3 °C and a cooling temperature difference of 2.6 °C when going
through the heating and cooling cycles. Due to its exceptional personal ther-
moregulation performance and long-term stability, this proposed strategy
exhibits considerable potential for the application of healthcare, outdoor
sports, and protective clothing.
Clothing, as an indispensable barrier between the skin and the envir-
onment, is critical in regulating the wearing comfort of the human
body in daily life1. By exchanging heat and moisture with the outside
environment through the medium of textiles, the body-textile micro-
climate is formed between the clothing and the human skin2,3. A body-
textile microclimate with appropriate temperature and humidity
(32 ± 1 °C, 50 ± 10% RH) provides both physical and psychological
comfort for the individual, however, its equilibrium is often disrupted
due to weather or human behaviors4,5. For example, when going from a
comfortable environment to a hot or cool environment, the human
body is unable to quickly adapt to the transition, resulting in unplea-
sant heat/cold irritation and possibly even medical emergencies6. With
the ongoing development of the national health system, people are
gradually shifting from a negative lifestyle based on overdraft and
medical treatment to a healthy lifestyle centered on healthcare and
prevention. Therefore, wearable thermoregulatory clothing that can
keep the body-textile microclimate in a comfortable range has been a
long-sought but challenging aim for smart textiles7,8.
Active responsive textiles allow for the warming or cooling of the
human body depending on the surroundings9,10. By sensing the stimuli
(e.g., temperature, humidity, light, electricity, and mechanical),
clothing is able to adjust the exchange efﬁciency with the external
environments or realize energy absorption/release11-14. Recently, phase
change materials used to regulate temperature ﬂuctuations without

but this suffered from leakage defect19. In recent years, electrospinning
technology has been widely used to prepare phase change textiles for
personal
thermal
management
due
to
its
high
structural
designability20. Li et al prepared multifunctional ﬁlms with sufﬁcient
enthalpy and the phase change capsules were strung on the ﬁbers with
a "candied haws stick" structure21. However, electrospinning ﬁbrous
membranes have been plagued by low strength and poor durability for
a long time. This makes it difﬁcult for the prepared ﬁbrous membranes
to meet the requirements of daily use. Polyurethane (PU) elastomers
have attracted much attention due to their excellent mechanical
properties and applicability22. Structural design strategies based on
various intermolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, π-π
stacking, and ionic cross-linking) have been widely explored, indicat-
ing the feasibility of electrospinning ﬁbrous membranes with high
strength and elasticity23. It is worth noting that the strong entangle-
ment of polymer networks makes it difﬁcult to develop electrospun
ﬁbrous membranes with ordered molecular chains and satisfactory
mechanical properties24. In addition, it remains another challenge to
improve the particle loading and homogeneity of membranes to
ensure their reliability in functional applications.
Herein, we conceive a hierarchical structural engineering strategy
by combining the hydrogen-bonding interaction network and physical
bonding sites to fabricate the toughness composite ﬁbrous membrane
with efﬁcient resistance to external forces. The PU polymer with high
hydrogen-bonding content was constructed and through molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that aggregation of molecular
chains can be reduced by adding ethanol (EtOH), which leads to easier
molecular movement and orientation. In particular, we combine this
strategy with the electrospinning technique to shape functional
nanoparticles into PU matrix. The nanoparticles were distributed in the
interconnected ﬁbers and showed their high binding stability. More-
over, the bi-directional thermoregulation fabric (Bi-DTF) was assem-
bled, which could eliminate the irritation from environmental
switching, extending the body's comfort. The as-prepared Bi-DTF
exhibits high strength (12.7 MPa) with superior elastic recovery, con-
tinuous workability, as well as excellent durability (500 rubbing or 50
washing cycles).
Results
Design and processing of Bi-DTF
We designed the Bi-DTF according to three crucial considerations: (i)
the ﬁber substrate must be strong enough; (ii) the functional particles
must be well-assembled into the ﬁbers; and (iii) the work performance
must be stable during the long-term service life. The ﬁrst requirement
was enabled by employing hydrogen-bonded assisted engineering in
PU polymers. As depicted in Fig. 1a, the multiple hydrogen-bonding
interactions facilitate effective energy dissipation under external forces.
The fabrication of the PU ﬁbrous membrane began with the preparation
of a precursor solution containing polymer and solvents. Notably, the
N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was a benign solvent, while the addi-
tion of EtOH effectively minimized the intermolecular chain entangle-
ment. The MD simulations were conducted to demonstrate the states of
PU, PU/DMF, and PU/DMF/EtOH systems. As revealed in Fig. 1b, c and
Supplementary Fig. 1, the chain in the PU/DMF/EtOH system exhibited a
more loose stacking state due to the larger free volume25. Besides, the
contribution of van der Waals and electrostatic forces to the overall
cohesion energy in different systems was further compared (Fig. 1d).
The results proved that the contribution of van der Waals force in the
PU system was as high as 86.8%, which is the main cause for the
entanglement of polymer chains26. After the addition of DMF, the
contribution of van der Waals force decreased, and that of electrostatic
force increased, which indicates that the original equilibrium of PU
gradually disintegrated. Obviously, EtOH further facilitated this phe-
nomenon, making it easier for the molecular chains of the PU to be
reordered and arranged by external forces.
Subsequently, the functional nanoparticles were incorporated
into the PU solution, the softened PU molecular chains were more
conducive to the dispersion of particles (Fig. 1e). Under the stretching
effect of the high-voltage electrostatic ﬁeld, the PU molecular chains
were oriented along the ﬁber axis and encapsulated the nanoparticles.
Through the adjustment of the curing rate, the dual cross-linked
composite PU ﬁbers with high nanoparticle loading were successfully
prepared. Typically, phase change nanocapsules (PCN) and boron
nitride nanosheets (BN) were added to the PU to develop phase change
membrane (PC-M, Fig. 1f) and thermal conductive membrane (TC-M,
Fig. 1g), respectively. As seen from the inset images, the nanoparticles
were uniformly distributed in the ﬁbers, which helps to prevent the
shedding of functional components. Through dual-crosslinked struc-
tural design, the Janus ﬁbrous membrane named Bi-DTF was fabri-
cated, and the thickness of fabric was controlled at PC-M: TC-M = 2:1
(Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1i, the Bi-DTF
(~0.18 g) could successfully lift a 2 kg weight, equivalent to ~1100 times
its mass, demonstrating its superior robustness. The Bi-DTF could
attenuate stimuli caused by sudden ﬂuctuations in ambient tempera-
ture through its well-integrated thermal characteristics, thereby
establishing a relatively stable and comfortable body-textile micro-
environment for individuals (Supplementary Fig. 3). This property was
substantiated through empirical experiments in which volunteers
wore T-shirts embedded with various fabric samples (Supplementary
Figs. 4, 5). Compared to commercial textiles, the Bi-DTF exhibited
lower temperatures when experiencing hot environments (Fig. 1j), and
higher temperatures in colder environments (Fig. 1k), attributed to its
fast thermal response and efﬁcient energy storage/release mechan-
isms. Especially in summer, conventional textiles may trigger thermal
discomfort during temperature variations, however, Bi-DTF addresses
this issue.
Synthesis and thermal properties of ﬁbrous membranes
Polyester polyols (HDPOL) were employed as soft segments, iso-
phorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)oxamide
(BHO) were used as hard segments, and chain extender to prepare PU
elastomersby the solvent-free polymerization. The synthetic route and
characterization of the PU are shown in Supplementary Figs. 6-9 and
Table 1. The abundant carbamate and amide bonds could provide a
large number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to incorporate
high-density and strong interactions in the microdomains27. The
hydrogen bonding of the PU was investigated by FTIR. As shown in
Fig. 2a, the signal in the wavenumber range of 1600 −1800 cm−1 could
be attributed to the C = O group28. Further analysis of this region
through peak ﬁtting revealed that the as-prepared PU elastomer was
deconvolved into four sub-peaks (Supplementary Table 2). These sub-
peaks can be assigned as follows: the free carbonyl groups ≈1731 cm−1,
the hydrogen-bonded disordered carbonyl groups ≈1663 cm−1, and the
hydrogen-bonded ordered carbonyls groups from 1706 to 1629 cm−1,
respectively. The bonded content in PU elastomers was determined to
be as high as 78.1%. The packing state of the structure in PU was further
performed. As depicted in Fig. 2b, the aggregation of the hard seg-
ments of the polymer occurs due to hydrogen bonding cross-linking,
leading to the formation of a phase-separated structure between the
hard and soft domains. The calculated cohesive energy density (CED)
of the system was 367.4 J cm−3, which was usually lower than 300 for
elastomer29,30. In addition, the distribution of chain segments in the
theoretical simulation showed that the hard segments in the PU system
were more dispersed in the soft segments, which is conducive to the
elimination of the stress concentration and the enhancement of the
energy dissipation efﬁciency31. The microphase separation structure
was further evidenced by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXs) (Fig. 2c).
The average distance between hard phases was determined to be
10.8 nm, indicating a smaller average distance between the hard
domains and higher hydrogen bonding density. In contrast, excessive

hard domain aggregation may impair the compatibility between soft
and hard segments, resulting in stress concentration. Consequently,
the precise modulation of phase-separated morphology, coupled with
the establishment of dense hydrogen bonding networks within the PU,
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
optimizing
the
material's
mechanical
performance.
The synthesis of composite functional ﬁbers with dual-crosslinked
networks depends on the molecular chain movement, nanoparticle
dispersion, and phase separation with the charged jets. Based on the
aforementioned analysis, EtOH was introduced during the preparation
of the precursor solution, and the formation mechanism of the com-
posite structure is summarized in Fig. 2d. The purpose of the
electrospinning is to generate a continuous jet from the metal needle
tip. Initially, PU dominates the blend solution, nanoparticles are dis-
persed in the polymer solution and conﬁned into PU ﬁbers. EtOH
promotes the mobility of the polymer chains and reduces the aggre-
gation of chains, resulting in a decrease in surface tension (Step I).
Here, PU ﬁbers act as the conﬁning template for the particles. Com-
pared to microspheres, the conﬁnement of nanoparticles into polymer
ﬁbers to obtain one-dimensional colloidal chains is a relatively simple
process due to their size feature32. It can be observed from step II that
during the jet thinning process, the molding of the composite ﬁbers is
controlled by the viscosity of the blend solutions. The PU works as a
binder to produce an adhesive force between particles; and this force

is proportional to the viscosity33. Thus, uniform colloidal ﬁbers are
obtained when the adhesive force between the particles is stronger.
The above hypothesis can be substantiated by evaluating the proper-
ties of solutions. With the addition of EtOH in solvents, a sharp
decrease in surface tension was noted, while the viscosity of the
solution progressively increased (Fig. 2e).
With the continuous drafting of the electrostatic force, the solvent
diffuses with the non-solvent and exchanges at the interface between
the spinning jets and the water vapor, the wrapped particles are
packed and assembled into the ﬁbers, leading to the formation of the
composite ﬁbers (Step III, Fig. 2d)34. We experimentally analyzed the
phase separation behavior of the precursor solution. In the ternary
phase diagram of PU/DMF/EtOH, the binodal curve is away from the
PU-DMF axis, which suggests that a high proportion of EtOH still leaves
the solution in a homogeneous liquid phase (Fig. 2f, Supplement
Fig. 10a). In the ternary phase diagram of PU/DMF/H2O, the binodal

curve is closer to the PU-DMF axis, implying that as long as a small
amount of water is needed, the phase separation of PU solution can be
induced (Fig. 2g, Supplement Fig. 10b). Through the adjustment of the
curing rate, the dual cross-linked PU ﬁbrous membrane with both
physically bonded structure and hydrogen bonding network was suc-
cessfully prepared, as shown in Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 11 and
Table 2. Furthermore, It can be found that it is difﬁcult to form uniform
ﬁbers in the absence of EtOH (Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore,
tunable structures of PU/nanoparticles could be obtained by adjusting
the weight ratio of EtOH, two components, and water.
The morphological changes in the PC-M with different doping
ratios are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 13, where PCN was regularly
enriched in the ﬁbers with the increase of loading. The thermal energy
storage property of PC-M was studied by differential scanning calori-
meter (DSC). As shown in Fig. 2i, the absorption and exothermic peaks
were narrow and concentrated, with increasing PCN content, the peak
height gradually increased. Speciﬁcally, the crystallization and melting
temperatures of PC-M with 60 wt% PCN loading are 24.8 and 31.7 °C,
and the corresponding enthalpies are 66.3 and 64.2 J g−1, respectively,
which is slightly lower than theoretical enthalpies, revealing the
effective loading of PCN in nanoﬁbers (Supplementary Fig. 14 and
Table 3). Furthermore, the heat absorption/exothermic abilities of the
ﬁbers remained stable even after 100 heating and cooling cycles
(Fig. 2j, Supplementary Fig. 15 and Table 4), which indicates the ther-
mal stability of the prepared membranes. Conventional textiles lacked
timely interaction with temperature variations of the surroundings due
to their low thermal conductivity35. In order to raise the thermal sen-
sitivity of the ﬁbrous membrane, The PU matrix is dopped with BN
nanosheets, and the microstructures of TC-M with various loading are
shown in Supplementary Fig. 16, where the interconnected BN builds
up heat transfer pathways (Supplementary Fig. 17)36. The variation of
thermal conductivities is shown in Fig. 2k and Supplementary Table 5,
in which the through-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities of TC-
M with BN loading of 50 wt% are 0.187 and 1.024 W m−1 K−1, respec-
tively. The good thermal conductivity provides a substantial founda-
tion for the subsequent sensing of external temperature changes.
By comprehensively comparing and integrating the unique
properties, the Bi-DTF with Janus structure was fabricated, as depicted
in Supplementary Fig. 18-20 and Table 6-7. The Bi-DTF is light and thin
(~90 g m−2), with through-plane thermal conductivity of 0.163 W m−1 K−1
and melting enthalpy of 45.9 J g−1, while the energy storage density is
up to 4.1 kJ m−2. Furthermore, the high-temperature thermal stability
was experimentally veriﬁed. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 21, the
octadecane (OD) melted and deformed rapidly at 80 °C, while the PCF
maintained good shape stability due to its stable multiple encapsula-
tion structure.
Mechanical and durability properties of Bi-DTF
Phase change fabrics developed in the previous studies showed poor
mechanical properties due to size or dimensional incompatibility,
making it difﬁcult to meet consumer demand for long-lasting service
performance (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). Remarkably, the
mechanical property of Bi-DTF was signiﬁcantly improved by intro-
ducing the hierarchical cross-linked architecture. As shown in Fig. 3a,
the tensile strength of PU elastomer was measured to be 60.4 MPa and
elongation of 2309.4% at break, which showed an advantage with a
toughness of up to 648.1 MJ m−3 that surpasses most reported mate-
rials (Supplementary Table 11). Moreover, cyclic stretching with
increased strain and the recovery ability of elastomers was evaluated.
The hysteresis loop gradually increased with strain improvement
(Fig. 3b), which may be attributed to the gradient energy dissipation
formed by the gradual breakage of the weak hydrogen bonds and
strongly ordered hydrogen-bonded domains37. Besides, the cyclic
tensile curve demonstrates that the mechanical properties of the
material gradually recover and the broken hydrogen bonds are re-
associated (Fig. 3c). This is due to the fact that the incorporation of
BHO moieties provided abundant hydrogen-bonding sites, which
acted as sacriﬁcial bonds to dissipate energy through breaking and
recombination (Fig. 3d)38. Collectively, the PU elastomers exhibit
excellent tensile and elastic recovery abilities rendering it as the
polymeric substrate with exceptional comprehensive mechanical
properties.
Supplementary Fig. 22 presents the mechanical properties of
electrospinning PU ﬁbrous membranes with a mechanical strength of
32.5 MPa and elongation of 571.5% at break. With the increase of
nanoparticles, the strength and elongation declined (Supplementary
Fig. 23). Intriguingly, the Bi-DTF boasted a high breaking elongation of
243.9% and a tensile strength of 12.7 MPa (Fig. 3e), with a toughness of
18.3 MJ m−3. The cyclic loading-unloading tensile curves of Bi-DTF at
50% strain are displayed in Fig. 3f. There was an obvious hysteresis in
the ﬁrst-cycle curve due to the force-induced hydrogen bond breaking
leading to substantial energy dissipation. The 11th cycle occurred after
3 h, which is close to the cyclic loading-unloading curve of the ﬁrst lap,
suggesting good elastic recovery of the Bi-DTF. Fig. 3g further
demonstrates that the prepared samples exhibit ultra-high elastic
recovery capacity, which can signiﬁcantly improve the fatigue resis-
tance and reliability of the textiles during repeated deformation pro-
cesses. To characterize the physical bonding properties of the Janus
membrane, a peeling test was conducted with an overlap length of
4 cm and a width of 2 cm. As illustrated in Fig. 3h, the peel strength was
0.2 N cm−1, and the slip displacement was~ 8 cm, attributed to the good
physical bonding between the ﬁbers. The fracture energy of the Bi-DTF
composites exhibited a remarkably high value (~20 J m−2) in compar-
ison to previously reported works39, which typically range from
1 ~ 5 J m−2. The mechanical performance of Bi-DTF can be attributed to
the following factors: i) the multiple hydrogen bonds in the PU matrix,
which allow dynamic molecular chains to break and reorganize; ii) the
good compatibility of the particles with the polymeric substrate
reducing stress defects; and iii) the physical binding points between
ﬁbers preventing inter-ﬁber slip. These factors signiﬁcantly improved
the energy dissipation efﬁciency upon external force.
Durability is the major issue impeding the practical applicability of
the electrospinning membranes. Therefore, the abrasion resistance
tests were performed on the Bi-DTF from different sides (Supple-
mentary Fig. 24). It took 2000 standard friction cycles for the fracture
of Bi-DTF (Supplementary Fig. 25). At 500 friction cycles, the mass
retention of ﬁbrous membranes was still as high as 95% (Fig. 3i). Due to
the layer-by-layer deposition characteristic of electrospinning and the
unique hierarchical crosslinked structure, the weight loss process of
the ﬁbrous membrane was manifested as the failure of physical points,
ﬁber breakage, and layer-by-layer detachment of the ﬁbrous mem-
brane, which can effectively prevent the shedding of nanoparticles
(Supplementary Fig. 26)40. In addition, Bi-DTF showed excellent
detergent resistance, maintaining stable work performance even after
50 standard washes with less than 1% weight loss and plastic defor-
mation (Fig. 3j, Supplementary Fig. 27 and Table 10). Additionally, the
dyes were introduced to customize the textiles in different colors. The
results showed that the ﬁlms exhibited good optical properties, with
chromatic aberration DE*ab < 3 over 50 washing cycles (Fig. 3k and
Supplementary Fig. 28).
Evaluation of dynamic comfort performance
Although phase change textiles contribute thermal regulation cap-
ability, their low moisture permeability might result in a negative
impact on the overall performance of the garment41. However, the
previous studies tended to raise the enthalpies while disregarding
the complicated heat-moisture interactions in the body-textile
microclimate42. This contradiction failed to be adequately balanced
for consideration in practical product design and it lacks substantial
empirical backing. Therefore, in this study, Janus wettability was also

considered in the design of ﬁbrous membranes. As seen in Supple-
mentary Fig. 29, the water contact angle of PC-M was 139.3 ° due to
the addition of PCN, while TC-M could spread and absorb liquid

the interconnected channels between the ﬁbers in an endeavor to

To visualize the performance of the fabrics, commercial fabrics
(Cotton, Coolmax, and Cool-fabric) were selected for comparison.
We tested the water vapor transporting rate (WVTR) of fabrics at 15
and 35 °C, respectively (Fig. 4a). The results showed that the WVTR of
fabrics at 15 °C was generally lower than that of fabrics stabilized at
35 °C attributed to the slower migration of water vapor at low tem-
peratures, beneﬁcial for the body insulation and moisturization. At

35 °C, the moisture permeability of Bi-DTF was comparable to that of
Coolmax, indicating that the porous structure of the ﬁbrous mem-
brane was sufﬁcient to achieve the desired moisture permeability.
We further compared the water evaporation rate of fabrics with
varying initial water amounts under 35 °C (Fig. 4b). The values of
other fabrics tended to be saturated when the initial water content
reached 0.4 g, which is strongly related to the water diffusion
behavior and adsorption/desorption rate (Supplementary Fig. 30)44.
The Bi-DTF possessed a higher water evaporation rate than other
fabrics, and it kept boosting with the increase of initial water amount.
This enhanced water evaporation rate helps to speed up the sweat
transmission rate in the body-textile microclimate and prolongs the
cooling effect. We further investigated the relative water content
changes about the two layers of the Bi-DTF by a moisture manage-
ment tester. It showed a desired one-way water transport index
(1338.6%) when water traveled from the PC-M to the TC-M and
−1143.9% from the opposite direction (Fig. 4c and Supplementary
Fig. 31). The differential wetting behavior between the two sides aids
in the efﬁcient management of sweat and prevents it from accumu-
lating on the skin side, delivering uncomfortable adhesion; it also

inhibits the penetration of external rainwater, which may cause a chill
sensation.
Previous researchers have mainly focused on the cooling and
heating impacts of PCMs as monolayers during temperature variation,
and given less consideration to the additive/detractive effect of
moisture permeability on the overall wearable system45. The main
factors determining the exchange process are human metabolic
activity, the structural properties of the fabric, and the temperature/
humidity of the macroenvironment46. By establishing the moisture/
heat transfer models based on (phase change solid material) PC-S and
Bi-DTF, the results can be concluded that the body-textile micro-
climate tends to be in the comfort zone through the coupling of the
hydrophobic response layer/hydrophilic thermal conductivity layer
(Supplement Fig. 32 and Note 2). On this basis, we proposed a setup to
evaluate the dynamic comfort management performance of fabrics in
adjusting the body-textile microenvironment when the circumstance
switches, as illustrated in Fig. 4d. We ﬁrst moved the palm from a
comfortable (~22 °C) into a high temperature (~35 °C) environment. As
the ambient temperature rose, the temperature of the microclimate
covered by the other fabrics increased rapidly, whereas Bi-DTF
experienced a gradually growing plateau due to heat absorption of
the phase change components, with an equilibrium time of 94 s
(Fig. 4e). When we shifted the palm from a comfortable to a low
temperature (~15 °C) environment, the microclimate temperature of
other fabrics also declined with the ambient. However, the Bi-DTF
remained in the comfortable phase for a longer period before slowly
decreasing with an equilibrium time of 124 s (Fig. 4f). The above results
show that Bi-DTF has a better cooling and heating effect during
environment switching.
We further tested the cyclic cooling and heating properties of the
fabrics by shifting the palm three times and dripping water on the skin
surface or external fabrics to simulate sweat/rainwater. As illustrated in
Fig. 4g, during heating cycles, even though the Bi-DTF ﬂuctuated
slowly with ambient temperature, the microclimate of Bi-DTF exhib-
ited a smaller temperature difference and managed perspiration more
efﬁciently in the sweating condition. The Bi-DTF provided excellent
thermal insulation and successfully blocked the intrusion of rainwater
(Fig. 4h). On the contrary, the other fabrics switched rapidly with the
ambient temperature after moving into the cold environment, and the
microclimate temperature dropped rapidly, especially after dripping
water, causing cold irritation to the skin and reducing the wearing
comfort. Fig. 4i gives the threshold value of the body-textile micro-
environment when covering different fabrics undergoing cyclic high
and low-temperature environments, the Bi-DTF showed a maximum
temperature difference of 2.3 and 2.6 °C, respectively. It is obvious that
Bi-DTF can effectively absorb or release heat when dealing with high
and low temperature switching to maintain the appropriate tempera-
ture range of the body-textile microenvironment, offering both phy-
sical and psychological comfort for individuals. We comprehensively
compared the thermal and humidity comfort of various fabrics, and
the results show that the fabrics are efﬁcient in terms of self-adaptive
performance (Fig. 4j).
Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated the remarkable integration of
toughness and self-adaptive Bi-DTF. This achievement originates from
the optimized chain movements, characterized by reduced chain
aggregation, improved compatibility with functional particles, and the
construction of dynamic stress-dissipative networks. This hierarchical
structural reconﬁguration signiﬁcantly raises the durability of com-
posite ﬁbrous membranes. The innovative employment of integrated
heat adsorption/release and directional water transportation together
effectively eliminates heat/cold irritation caused by environmental
switching and ensures sufﬁcient breathability, moisture permeability,
and enhanced water evaporation rate. Compared with commercial
textiles, Bi-DTF shows a maximum thermal temperature difference of
only 2.3 °C and a cooling temperature difference of 2.6 °C when going
through the heating and cooling cycles. Notably, there was no sig-
niﬁcant reduction in the energy storage capacity even after 100
recharging, 50 washing, or 500 rubbing cycles, indicating its high
robustness. We believe the successful construction of attractive
materials offers fascinating perspectives on the development of smart,
toughness, and durable clothing that dynamically regulates comfort,
prevents disease, and saves energy.
Methods
General
The experimental materials and detailed synthesis procedure of PCN
are given in the Supplementary methods.
Preparation of PU
Typically, HDPOL (54 g, 0.03 mol) was vacuum heated at 110 °C and
stirred for 2 h to remove the moisture in a ﬂask. Subsequently, IPDI
(23.3 g, 0.105 mol) was added, and DBTDL (0.1 g) was used as a catalyst,
followed by stirring under nitrogen at 85 °C for 1 h. Then, BHO (12.3 g,
0,07 mol) as the chain extender was added to the system, and the
temperature was raised to 180 °C under stirring for 30 min to obtain
the ﬁnal PU elastomer.
Fabrication of Fibrous Membranes
The precursor solutions for electrospinning were obtained by dissol-
ving PU and nanoﬁllers in the mixed solvent of DMF and EtOH (weight
ratio of 1:1) at room temperature. For the preparation single-layer
ﬁbrous membranes with various loading, the weight ratio of PU,
nanoﬁllers, and mixed solvent were changed from 16:4:80, 16:11:73,
15:15:70, 14:21:65 to 12:28:60, respectively. Importantly, in order to
enhance the hydrophilicity, a hydrophilic agent of TF (3 wt% relative to
PU) was added to the prepared PU/BN/mixed solution. The resultant
solutions were electrospun at a feeding rate of 3 mL h−1 under 30 kV in
the high humidity environment (80 ± 5% RH). The Bi-DTF was fabri-
cated layer-by-layer of the above-mentioned single-layer ﬁbrous
membranes with 60 wt% PCN loading and 50 wt% BN loading. The
colorful appearance was obtained by additionally adding dye (1 wt%
relative to PU) to the mixed PU/BN/TF solution.
Characterization
The 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III (400 MHz)
spectrometer by using DMSO-d6 as the solvent. GPC test was per-
formed in THF solution at 35 °C with an elution rate of 1.0 mL min−1 on a
Waters-E2695 GPC system equipped with a refractive index detector.
The apparent molecular weights were determined on PLgel Mixed-B+
PLgel Mixed-C columns using linear poly(methyl methacrylate) stan-
dards. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was measured
at room temperature on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spec-
trometer equipped with a diamond ATR crystal. 2D SAXS patterns were
measured using a Bruker NANOSTAR instrument. The 1D WAXD curves
were obtained from the DIFFRAC.SAXS software. The periodicity (L)
was calculated by Bragg's Law:
L = 2π
qmax
ð1Þ
where qmax is the value of the peak in the intensity curves.
The Glass Transition Temperature was acquired by Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC, DISCOVER 250). All the samples were
heated from −90 °C to 150 °C at 20 °C min−1 and cooled at 20 °C min−1
from 150 °C to −90 °C. All data were collected during the second
heating run from −90 °C to 150 °C at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 to
eliminate thermal history. The phase change behavior of samples was
characterized by the DSC at a heating or cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 in a

nitrogen atmosphere with a gas ﬂow rate of 50 mL min−1. The capacity
of latent heat storage (ΔHc and ΔHm) was obtained from DSC. The DSC
measurement uncertainties of enthalpy and temperature were 1.3%
and 0.34 °C respectively.
The microstructures of samples were observed using FE-SEM (S-
4800) and TEM (JEM-2100). The size distribution of PCN was deter-
mined by a nanoparticle size analyzer (ZEN3700). The porous archi-
tecture was evaluated utilizing a physisorption analyzer (ASAP 2460).
The pore size distribution of the ﬁbrous membranes was investigated
by the capillary ﬂow porometer (CFP-1100AI). The WCAs were
obtained from a digital goniometer (SL200B). The reﬂectance of col-
orful ﬁbrous samples in the visible wavelength range was measured
using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV3600i Plus). The chromatic
aberration DE*ab of textiles was tested by colorimeter (NR10QC). The
Tensile tests and cyclic tensile deformation treatment were performed
on an Instron 34 TM-5 universal machine. The stretching rate was set at
50 mm min−1.
Measurement of through-plane and in-planed thermal
conductivities
The speciﬁc heat capacity (Cp) was acquired by DSC using sapphire as
the standard sample. The thermal diffusivity (α) was measured by
adopting the laser ﬂash method (LFA 467) at 25 °C. The through-plane
and in-planed thermal conductivity (K) were calculated by the follow-
ing equation:
K = ρ  Cp  α
ð2Þ
where ρ corresponds to the sample density.
WVTR measurement
The WVTR of fabrics was detected using an upright up method in
accordance with ASTM E96 using a moisture tester (YG601H), with a
modiﬁed temperature (15 ± 2 or 35 ± 2 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5% RH).
Water evaporation rate test
The deionized water was dropped on the inner side of the fabric, and
then the fabric was hung in a controlled atmosphere (temperature of
35 ± 2 °C, humidity of 50 ± 5%RH, and air velocity of 0.3 ~ 0.5 m s−1). The
water evaporation rate is calculated as the weight change divided by
the time required for mass balance.
Test of directional water transport behavior
The directional water transport behavior of the fabrics was quantita-
tively analyzed by MMT (SDL Atlas m290) according to AATCC 195-
2009. The one-way water transfer index (R) was calculated by follow-
ing equations in an in-built software:
R =
R
Ub



R
Ut


T
ð3Þ
where Ub is moisture content in the bottom layer, Ut is moisture con-
tent in the top layer and T is total testing time.
Peel test
The preparation of bi-layer membranes involves two steps: 1) Fabri-
cation of the bottom layer by electrospinning on top of a glossy paper.
2) Fabrication of the top layer, half of the dried electrospun membrane
(bottom layer) was covered with a glossy paper. The polymer was
extruded and deposited onto the bottom layer to produce the second
layer of electrospun membranes. To measure the adhesion strength
between layers, the membrane was ﬂipped up to 180 ° using an Instron
at 50 mm min−1 crosshead speed.
Abrasion test
The abrasion test was conducted with a Martindale abrasion tester
(YG401C) based on ISO 12947. The sample (38 mm) was mounted on
the friction area and a loading weight of 260 g was applied, during
which wool felt was used as the abrasive.
Washing resistance test
Following ISO 6330, the washability of the fabric was tested by adding
standard detergent and washing the sample in an A-type standard
washing machine (Y089D, Program No. 4H). The samples were 5 pieces
of 10 × 10 cm and the total air-dry mass after addition of ballast was
controlled with 2 kg. After the last rinse, the samples were dried by
natural hanging.
Thermal management tests of fabrics
To verify the thermal management performance of the fabrics for
actual wear, different fabrics were embedded into T-shirts and the
temperature changes on the fabric surface were recorded with an
infrared thermal camera. In addition, a test setup for body-textile
microenvironment was built for practicalapplication demonstrationof
environment switching. The temperature of the body-textile micro-
environment was tracked using thermocouples. All the participants of
the study gave written informed consent for the publication of the
images and data. The authors afﬁrm that human research participants
provided written informed consent for publication of the images in
Figs. 1 and 4.
Cohesive energy analysis
The MD simulation systems of PU are comprised of ﬁve polymer
chains, each of which consists of two hard and two soft segments, in
which the number of repeating units in the soft segments is 6 (Sup-
plementary Figs. 33, 34). The molecular number ratios of PU/DMF and
PU/DMF/EtOH simulation systems were set to 1/330 and 1/165/260,
respectively, with a mass fraction of ~15 wt% for PU in the entire system
and ~50 wt% for EtOH in the solvent (Supplementary Figs. 35, 36). The
simulations were carried out using the Forcite module of the Materials
Studio with COMPASS II force ﬁeld.
The cohesive energy of a system of molecules, Ecoh, is the average
energy required to separate all molecules to an inﬁnite distance from
each other:
Ecoh = - < Einter > = < Eintra > - < Etotal >
ð4Þ
where Einter is the total energy between all molecules, which is the total
energy of a system (Etotal), minus the intramolecular energy (Eintra). The
bracket, "<...>", represents an average over an NVT ensemble.
The cohesive energy density, CED, is simply the cohesive energy
per unit of volume:
CED = Ecoh
V

Statistics and reproducibility
Each experiment was repeated at least three times independently with
similar results. All data are expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD).
