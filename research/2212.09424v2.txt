The Ising model on networks plays a fundamental role as a testing ground for understanding cooperative
phenomena in complex systems. Here we solve the synchronous dynamics of the Ising model on random
graphs with an arbitrary degree distribution in the high-connectivity limit. Depending on the distribution of the
threshold noise that governs the microscopic dynamics, the model evolves to nonequilibrium stationary states.
We obtain an exact dynamical equation for the distribution of local magnetizations, from which we ﬁnd the
critical line that separates the paramagnetic from the ferromagnetic phase. For random graphs with a negative
binomial degree distribution, we demonstrate that the stationary critical behavior as well as the long-time critical
dynamics of the ﬁrst two moments of the local magnetizations depend on the distribution of the threshold noise.
In particular, for an algebraic threshold noise, these critical properties are determined by the power-law tails of
the distribution of thresholds. We further show that the relaxation time of the average magnetization inside each
phase exhibits the standard mean-ﬁeld critical scaling. The values of all critical exponents considered here are
independent of the variance of the negative binomial degree distribution. Our work highlights the importance of
certain details of the microscopic dynamics for the critical behavior of nonequilibrium spin systems.

INTRODUCTION
Understanding cooperative phenomena in large interacting
complex systems is at the forefront of various branches of sci-
ence [1-4]. The Ising model on random graphs provides a
general framework to tackle this problem and to explore how
heterogeneous interactions among the spins inﬂuence their
dynamical behavior. Heterogeneity here refers to local ﬂuctu-
ations in the graph topology, such as the number of neighbors
coupled to each spin (the so-called degrees [5]).
Universal scaling around phase transitions is perhaps the
most striking collective property of spin models [6]. Renor-
malization group theory and the computation of critical ex-
ponents have prompted the notion of universality classes, i.e.,
the fact that systems very different in nature share the same
critical behavior. Understanding how network heterogeneities
modify the critical properties of spin models is a central prob-
lem in network science [1]. Speciﬁcally, the equilibrium crit-
ical behavior of the Ising model on networks is characterized
by mean-ﬁeld critical exponents [7-9], as long as the fourth
moment of the degree distribution is ﬁnite.
Progress has been much slower on the side of the dynam-
ical critical properties of spin models on networks. To our
knowledge, the effect of network heterogeneities on the dy-
namical exponents [10] of the Ising model is not known. More
than that, depending on the details of the dynamics and of
the network structure [11-13], the Ising model may evolve to
nonequilibrium stationary states that do not follow the Boltz-
mann distribution. In this case, even if the interest lies only
on the stationary critical properties, one has to abandon equi-
librium statistical mechanics and shift to a full dynamical ap-
proach.
The nonequilibrium dynamics of the Ising model on ran-
dom graphs has been exactly solved in the thermodynamic
limit using the generating functional approach [14, 15] and
the cavity method [16].
Even though the microscopic dy-
namics of the model is by construction a Markovian process,
symmetric couplings among the spins induce retarded self-
interactions and the formal solution of the problem is a path-
probability for the effective dynamics of a single spin [16].
The history dependency encoded in the path-probability pre-
vents any attempt to calculate analytically the trace over the
single-spin conﬁgurations. Besides that, the dimension of the
path-probability grows exponentially in time, which quickly
renders numerical computations unfeasible. These features
make the dynamics of spin models on networks a notorious
difﬁcult problem, which has stimulated the design of various
approximate methods. Some of them rely on assumptions to
reduce the number of variables in the problem and obtain a
closed set of dynamical equations [17-20], while other ap-
proaches, such as the dynamical TAP equations [21-23] and
cluster variational methods [24, 25], are inspired in well estab-
lished methods for the equilibrium properties of spin models.
There are two main classes of graphs for which the effective
problem simpliﬁes and one can derive closed-form dynamical
equations: dense random graphs and sparse directed random
graphs [15, 16, 26]. In the former case, each spin is densely
connected with the rest of the network and the path probability
simpliﬁes on account of the law of large numbers. In the sec-
ond case, the absence of bidirected edges eliminate the history
dependency and the effective dynamics becomes Markovian.
In both cases, the exact dynamics follows from a simpliﬁed
form of the cavity equations for the path probability [16].
The cavity or message-passing equations provide an algo-
rithm to compute the local marginals of a variety of problems
deﬁned on random graphs [4, 27, 28]. In general, these equa-
tions do not admit analytic solutions on undirected graphs
with an heterogeneous structure.
However, the spectra of
undirected random graphs [29, 30] and the equilibrium of spin
models on networks [31] have been recently studied by means
of an interesting family of analytic solutions of the cavity
equations, in which the mean degree is inﬁnitely large, but
the solutions still depend on the full degree distribution. This
class of solutions is simple enough that it allows to address the
role of degree ﬂuctuations in a comprehensive way. Since the
cavity equations share the same formal structure across differ-
ent areas [4], one expects to extract an analogous solution for

the dynamics of the Ising model on heterogeneous networks.
Here we conﬁrm this expectation and derive an exact so-
lution for the synchronous dynamics of the Ising model on
highly-connected random graphs with an arbitrary degree dis-
tribution. The stochastic dynamics of the spins is governed
by an arbitrary distribution of the threshold noise that mim-
ics the contact of the system with a thermal bath. Depending
on the choice of the distribution of thresholds [11], the model
evolves to stationary states that are not described by the Boltz-
mann distribution.
Therefore, the present model allows to
clearly study how degree ﬂuctuations and the nonequilibrium
nature of the stationary states inﬂuence the critical properties
of the Ising model. Besides that, networks of binary units with
random thresholds give valuable insights into neural networks
[11, 12], choice and opinion dynamics [3, 32, 33], gene regu-
latory networks [13, 34-36], and socio-economic phenomena
[37].
We derive a simple dynamical equation for the full distribu-
tion of local magnetizations, from which we ﬁnd the critical
line that separates the paramagnetic from the ferromagnetic
region. We compute stationary and dynamical critical expo-
nents for the mean and the variance of local magnetizations
in the case of a negative binomial degree distribution [30, 31].
For an hyperbolic tangent distribution of thresholds, for which
the stationary states follow a Boltzmann-like distribution [38],
all critical indexes assume their standard mean-ﬁeld values
[10, 39-41]. In contrast, when the threshold noise follows
an algebraic distribution and detailed balance is presumably
broken, the stationary critical behavior and the long-time crit-
ical dynamics are both characterized by the same values of
the critical indexes, which are determined by the power-law
tails of the distribution of thresholds. On the other hand, the
characteristic time for the exponential relaxation of the aver-
age magnetization inside each phase always exhibits a mean-
ﬁeld critical behavior [10], independently of the distribution
of thresholds. Lastly, we derive analytic expressions for the
stationary distribution of local magnetizations inside the fer-
romagnetic phase and we show that its variance displays a
maximum as a function of the temperature, due to the inter-
play between threshold noise and degree ﬂuctuations. Some
of our theoretical ﬁndings are corroborated by numerical sim-
ulations.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we
deﬁne the model and its microscopic dynamics. Section III
explains how to obtain the recurrence equation for the dynam-
ics of the distribution of local magnetizations. We present the
results for the critical exponents in section IV, and some ﬁ-
nal remarks in section V. The paper contains an appendix that
explains how to solve the dynamics using the generating func-
tional approach.

MODEL DEFINITIONS
We study the dynamics of N Ising spins σi(t) ∈{−1, 1}
(i = 1, . . . , N) that interact through the edges of an undi-
rected and simple random graph [42].
The states evolve
in time t by following a Markov process, in which t =
0, 1, . . . , tmax is a discrete variable and all spins are syn-
chronously updated according to their local ﬁelds at the pre-
vious time step
σi(t + 1) = sign (hi [σ(t)] + Tζi(t)) ,
(1)
where {ζi(t)} are independent and identically distributed ran-
dom variables drawn from a distribution µ(ζ) that fulﬁlls
µ(−ζ) = µ(ζ) . The temperature T ≥0 controls the thresh-
old noise in the stochastic dynamics: for T = 0 the dynamics
is deterministic, whereas for T →∞it is completely random.
The local ﬁeld hi[σ(t)] at time t due to the global state
σ(t) = (σ1(t), . . . , σN(t)) is given by
hi[σ(t)] = J
c
N
X
j=1
Cijσj(t),
(2)
where the binary random variables Cij ∈{0, 1} are the ele-
ments of the adjacency matrix C that speciﬁes the topology of
the random graph model. If there is an interaction between the
spins located at nodes i and j, then we set Cij = 1, whereas
Cij = 0 if the corresponding spins do not interact. The matrix
C is symmetric (the graph is undirected) and its diagonal en-
tries are zero. The parameter J > 0 denotes the strength of the
pairwise ferromagnetic interactions between adjacent spins,
while c is the so-called mean degree (see below) or average
coordination number. The scaling of the coupling strengths
with c is suitable to analyze the model in the limit c →∞.
In order to derive a discrete map for the time evolution of
the global magnetization,
m(t) = 1
N
N
X
i=1
σi(t),
(3)
it is more convenient to formulate the dynamics in terms of
probabilities. Equation (1) deﬁnes a Markov process and the
probability p(σ, t) to observe a global conﬁguration σ =
(σ1, . . . , σN) at time t evolves as follows
p(σ, t + 1) =
X
σ′
W(σ|σ′)p(σ′, t),
(4)
whereP
σ′ runs over the 2N conﬁgurations of the system, and
the matrix element W(σ|σ′) is the conditioned probability to
observe a transition from state σ′ to σ. By integrating over
ζi(t) in Eq. (1), one ﬁnds the explicit form of the transition
matrix elements W(σ|σ′)
W(σ|σ′) =
N
Y
i=1
1
2 (1 + σiF [βhi(σ′)]) ,
(5)
where β = T −1, and F(x) is determined by the distribution
µ(ζ) of the threshold noise as follows
F(x) =
Z x
−x
dζ µ(ζ).
(6)
The function F(x) satisﬁes the properties
F(−x) = −F(x),
lim
x→±∞F(x) = ±1.
(7)

3
Depending on the choice of µ(ζ), the stationary distribution of
the spin conﬁgurations is not given by the Boltzmann distri-
bution and we expect that detailed balance breaks down [11].
Let us now specify the random graph ensemble. The coor-
dination number or degree Ki of node i, deﬁned in terms of
C as
Ki =
N
X
j=1
Cij,
(8)
gives the number of spins coupled to σi. One of our pur-
poses is to investigate how ﬂuctuations in the degree sequence
K1, . . . , KN impact the stationary and the dynamical critical
properties of the Ising model. Thus, we consider the conﬁg-
uration model of networks [5, 43, 44], in which the degrees
K1, . . . , KN are independently drawn from a common distri-
bution
pk = lim
N→∞
1
N
N
X
i=1
δKi,k,
(9)
and a single graph instance is generated by randomly choos-
ing pairs of nodes and then connecting them subject to the
prescribed degrees. The ﬁrst moment of pk yields the average
degree
c =
∞
X
k=0
kpk,
(10)
which provides the mean number of neighbors coupled to a
single spin. Since the degree distribution pk is speciﬁed at
the outset, the conﬁguration model provides the ideal setting
to explore the effect of degree ﬂuctuations by changing the
shape of pk.
In the next section, we exactly solve the nonequilibrium
dynamics of this model in the limit N →∞for arbitrary
distributions pk and µ(ζ). The solution is valid in the high-
connectivity limit c →∞, provided c/N →0. This regime
is achieved by ﬁrst taking the limit N →∞and then c →∞
afterwards [31].
III.
RECURRENCE EQUATIONS FOR THE DYNAMICS
In this section we derive an exact map for the time evolu-
tion of the global magnetization and for the full distribution of
local magnetizations in the limit c →∞by using the law of
large numbers. As a byproduct, we put forward an effective
approximation for the interactions between the spins valid for
large c. In the appendix A, we present a more rigorous deriva-
tion of the dynamical equation for the global magnetization
by using the generating functional approach [12, 45].
The probability pi(σ, t) of observing the spin at site i in the
state σ ∈{−1, 1} at time t follows from the marginalization
pi(σ, t) =
X
σ\σi
p(σ, t),
(11)
where P
σ\σi sums over the conﬁgurations of all spins except
for σi. The local magnetization mi(t) at time t reads
mi(t) =
X
σ
σpi(σ, t),
(12)
while the global magnetization m(t) is given by
m(t) = 1
N
N
X
i=1
mi(t).
(13)
Our primary aim is to obtain an exact recursive equation for
m(t) in the thermodynamic limit N →∞. Inserting Eq. (4)
in Eq. (11) and using the explicit form of W(σ|σ′), Eq. (5),
one can write the local magnetization as
mi(t + 1) =
X
σ
p(σ, t)F

βJ

X
j∈∂i
σj

,
(14)
where ∂i represents the set of nodes that are adjacent to node
i. Since the sum over j ∈∂i contains a number of terms of
order O(Ki), we invoke the law of large numbers for c →∞
and replace this sum by the expectation value

is the probability that a randomly chosen edge has one of its
spins in the state σ at time t. Thus, the spatial ﬂuctuations of
the local ﬁeld on the right hand side of Eq. (14) are solely
determined by the degree distribution. In the limit c →∞,
the local magnetization fulﬁlls
mi(t + 1) = F [βJGiu(t)] ,
(17)
where the rescaled degrees Gi = Ki/c (i = 1, . . . , N) are
distributed as follows
ν(g) = lim

(18)
In terms of ν(g), the global magnetization at time t + 1 is
determined by recurrence equation
m(t + 1) =
Z ∞
0
dg ν(g) F [βJgu(t)] .
(19)
Equations (17) and (19) are valid when the variance of the
rescaled degrees remains ﬁnite in the high-connectivity limit.
One can access this connectivity regime for N →∞by set-
ting c ∝N a (0 < a < 1) [31]. In contrast, one recovers
the dynamics of a fully-connected system in the dense regime

4
c ∝N (N →∞), for which degree ﬂuctuations are irrele-
vant.
In order to determine m(t + 1), we need to ﬁnd the recur-
rence equation for u(t). Inserting Eq. (16) in the deﬁnition of
u(t), we obtain
u(t + 1) =
PN
ij=1 Cijmi(t + 1)
PN
ij=1 Cij
.
(20)
For large c, we can use Eq. (17) and rewrite u(t+1) as follows
u(t + 1) =
PN
i=1 KiF [βJGiu(t)]
PN
i=1 Ki
.
(21)
We see that u(t) is a global observable that weights the lo-
cal magnetization of each site according to its rescaled degree
Gi = Ki/c. In the limit c →∞, the above equation is rewrit-
ten as
u(t + 1) =
Z ∞
0
dg ν(g) g F [βJgu(t)] .
(22)
Equations (19) and (22) describe the nonequilibrium dynam-
ics of the global magnetization of the Ising model on inﬁnitely
large random graphs in the high-connectivity limit c →∞.
This solution is valid for arbitrary distributions ν(g) and µ(ζ).
In the appendix A, we present a formal derivation of such
equations by using the generating functional approach pio-
neered in [45].
In contrast to fully-connected models, the local magneti-
zations on heterogeneous random graphs ﬂuctuate from site
to site. Equation (17) fully characterizes the spatial ﬂuctua-
tions of mi(t) at any time step t. The probability distribu-
tion P(m, t) of the local magnetization at time t is determined
only by ν(g) and by the activation function F(x). By mak-
ing a simple change of variables, we ﬁnd a formal recurrence
relation for P(m, t)
P(m, t + 1) =

(23)
in which F−1(x) is the inverse of F(x) under composition.
The above equation allows to study the nonequilibrium dy-
namics of the distribution P(m, t).
Interestingly, we can also compute the stationary distribu-
tion
p∞(σ) ≡lim
t→∞p(σ, t)
(24)
of the spin conﬁgurations in the high-connectivity limit. The
object p∞(σ) fulﬁlls the self-consistent equation
p∞(σ) =
X
σ′
W(σ|σ′)p∞(σ′).
(25)
Thus, in the stationary regime, σ′ in the local ﬁeld hi(σ′) of
Eq. (5) is sampled from p∞(σ′). By using the law of large
numbers, we can write
hi(σ′) = J
c
X
j∈∂i

c→∞
−−−→JGiu,
(26)
where we have assumed that u(t) evolves to a ﬁxed-point u
when t →∞. From Eqs. (5) and (26), we conclude that
W(σ|σ′) becomes independent of σ′ for large c, which im-
mediately leads to
p∞(σ) =
N
Y
i=1
1
2 [1 + σiF (βJGiu)] .
(27)
The above equation describes the stationary distribution of the
spins for a single realization of the graph in which both c and
N are very large, but the ratio c/N is vanishing small.
Equation (27) explicitly depends on the distribution µ of
the threshold noise by means of F(x).
For the particular
choice F(x) = tanh(x), the long-time synchronous dynam-
ics fulﬁlls detailed balance and Eq.
(27) corresponds to a
Boltzmann-like distribution [11, 38], which enables the appli-
cation of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Indeed, by start-
ing from the standard form of the equilibrium distribution
p∞(σ) ∼Q
i=1 cosh [βhi(σ)] for synchronous dynamics
[11], one can duplicate the conﬁguration space, apply the law
of large numbers on the local ﬁelds in the high-connectivity
limit, and then recover Eq. (27) when F(x) = tanh(x). The
fact that Eq. (27) is not generally given by a Boltzmann-like
form strongly indicates that detailed balance breaks down de-
pending on the choice of F(x) [11].
We end this section by presenting an useful approxima-
tion for the interaction matrix of the Ising model on random
graphs. We note from Eqs. (17) and (21) that the local ﬁeld at
node i can be written for large c as
hi [σ(t)] = J
N
N
X
j=1
GiGjmj(t).
(28)
It follows from Eqs. (2) and (28) that the entries of the original
adjacency matrix C can be replaced, for large enough c, by the
effective matrix elements
Ceﬀ
ij = c
N GiGj(i ̸= j).
(29)
The above equation provides a practical way to simulate the
adjacency matrix of the ferromagnetic Ising model on highly-
connected random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions,
without having to generate random graph instances using
more sophisticated algorithms [44, 46]. Equation (29) deﬁnes
a complete graph that is essentially equivalent to the graph en-
semble studied in [9]. Below we conﬁrm the exactness of Eq.
(29) by comparing our theoretical recurrence equation for the
average magnetization with numerical simulations.

RESULTS
Equations (22) and (23) describe the dynamics of the Ising
model on an inﬁnitely large random graph with an arbitrary
degree distribution ν(g) and for any symmetric distribution
µ(ζ) of the threshold noise. In this section we present results
for the stationary and the dynamical critical properties of the

which is parametrized by 0 < α < ∞and the mean degree c.
The variance σ2 of pbin

is given by
σ2 = c + c2
α .
(31)
We recover the geometric degree distribution [5] and the Pois-
son degree distribution by setting, respectively, α = 1 and
α →∞. Given that
lim
c→∞
σ2
c2 = 1
α,
(32)
the relative variance of pbin
k
is controlled only by α in the high-
connectivity limit, which renders the negative binomial distri-
bution very convenient to probe the effect of heterogeneous
degrees on the dynamics. Substituting Eq. (30) in Eq. (18),
we can ﬁnd the explicit form of ν(g)
νbin(g) =
αα
Γ(α)gα−1e−αg.
(33)
In the limit α →∞, the relative variance goes to zero and we
expect to recover the recurrence equations for the dynamics of
the Curie-Weiss model [12].
We will present numerical results for two different distribu-
tions of the threshold noise

(35)
where κ in µa(ζ) is a positive integer which ensures that the
symmetry µa(ζ) = µa(−ζ) is preserved. More precisely, we
will discuss results for κ ∈{1, 2, 3}. The corresponding acti-
vation functions are given by
Fh(x) = tanh (x),
(36)
Fa(x) =
x
(1 + x2κ)

2κ .
(37)
The hyperbolic tangent distribution µh(ζ) has exponen-
tial tails, while the algebraic distribution µa(ζ) behaves as
µa(ζ) ∝|ζ|−2κ−1 for |ζ| ≫1. Consequently, the n-th mo-
ment of µa(ζ) diverges if n ≥2κ. In addition, if the thresh-
old noise is sampled from µh, the stationary spin conﬁgu-
rations follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, obtained from
Eqs. (27) and (36). In contrast, the long-time behavior of
the system is not described by a Boltzmann-like distribution
if the threshold noise follows from µa. In this case the sys-
tem reaches nonequilibrium stationary states and equilibrium
statistical mechanics is not applicable. Thus, our choices of
µ allow us to examine how strong ﬂuctuations in the thresh-
old noise and the concomitant absence of Boltzmann equilib-
rium impact the dynamics and the stationary states of the Ising
model.
A.
Stationary behavior
The ﬁxed-point equations of the dynamics are obtained by
setting limt→∞u(t) = u and limt→∞m(t) = m in Eqs. (19)
and (22)
m =
Z ∞
0
dg ν(g) F (βJgu) ,
(38)
u =
Z ∞
0
dg ν(g) g F (βJgu) .
(39)
The above expressions generalize the standard mean-ﬁeld de-
scription of the Curie-Weiss model [47]. By setting F(x) =
Fh(x), we recover the ﬁxed-point equations derived through
equilibrium statistical mechanics in reference [31].
Since F(0) = 0, Eqs. (38) and (39) admit a paramagnetic
solution u = m = 0. By expanding the integrand of Eq. (39)
up to O(u), we ﬁnd that a nontrivial solution |u| > 0 appears
below the critical temperature
Tc = JAµ(1 + ∆2
ν),
(40)
where
∆2
ν =
Z ∞
0
dgg2ν(g) −1,
Aµ = dF
dx

x=0.
(41)
Equation (40) is valid for arbitrary distributions ν(g) and
µ(ζ), and it shows that the model has a ﬁnite critical tem-
perature when the variance of ν(g) is ﬁnite [7-9]. The tails
of µ(ζ) are irrelevant for the critical temperature Tc, which
depends on µ(ζ) only through its behavior around ζ = 0.
For ∆2
ν = 0 and Aµ = 1, we obtain the critical tempera-
ture Tc = J of the Curie-Weiss model [47]. Regular random
graphs and Erd¨os-R´enyi random graphs [42] are the most rep-
resentative homogeneous random graph ensembles for which
∆2
ν = 0.
The system undergoes a continuous transition between the
ferromagnetic (|m| > 0) and the paramagnetic (m = 0)
phase at T = Tc. The stationary order-parameter u deter-
mines the global magnetization m and all moments of the sta-
tionary distribution P(m) = limt→∞P(m, t) of local mag-
netizations. For u > 0 (u < 0) the support of P(m) is the
interval m ∈[0, 1] (m ∈[−1, 0]). By setting |u| ̸= 0, we
obtain from Eqs. (23), (36), and (37) the corresponding distri-
butions

For homogeneous random graphs, in which

relative variance of the negative binomial degree distribution (see Eq.
(32)). The solid lines follow from the analytic Eqs. (38), (39), and
(42). The symbols are results obtained from numerical simulations
of Eq. (1) for N = 104 and mean degree c = 102. The vertical bars
are the standard deviation calculated from 10 independent runs of the
simulations. The random graph samples in the numerical simulations
are generated from Eq. (29).
between topological and thermal ﬂuctuations, Var(m) is a
non-monotonic function of T, with a maximum that shifts to-
wards smaller temperatures for decreasing α. For 0 < α ≪1,
the degrees are very heterogeneous and a small amount of
thermal noise leads to strong ﬂuctuations of the local mag-
netizations. Figure 2 illustrates the typical shape of Ph(m)
for a negative binomial degree distribution and different tem-
peratures. Similarly to the distribution of effective ﬁelds cal-
culated in [31], the distribution Ph(m) exhibits a power-law
divergence at m = 0 for α < 1, which reﬂects the singular be-
havior of the rescaled degree distribution ν(g) at g = 0. The
results in ﬁgures 1 and 2 remain qualitatively the same for the
algebraic distribution of the threshold noise.

nite. The variance Var(m) vanishes linearly with Tc −T,
analogously to the variance of the replica-symmetric effective

In the case of the algebraic activation function Fa(x), an
expansion in powers of u contains diverging coefﬁcients, but

The above equations hold when ⟨G2κ+2⟩is ﬁnite. Remark-
ably, the critical exponents in Eqs. (46) and (47) are deter-
mined by the tails of the distribution µa of the threshold noise.
This is a surprising ﬁnding for a mean-ﬁeld model with long-
ranged interactions between the spins. Figure 3 compares Eqs.
(46) and (47) with numerical solutions obtained from Eqs.
(39) and (43) for different κ. The agreement between the an-
alytic results for the critical exponents and the numerical data
is excellent.

the local magnetizations m1(0), . . . , mN(0) by means of Eq.
(20). Throughout this section we consider a homogeneous ini-
tial condition mi(0) = m(0) (i = 1, . . . , N), which implies
that u(0) = m(0). Figure 4 compares the iteration of Eqs.
(19) and (22) for the average magnetization m(t) with numer-
ical simulations of Eq. (1) inside the ferromagnetic phase,
conﬁrming the exactness of the theoretical recurrence equa-
tions for c →∞. The ﬁnite-size simulation results of ﬁgure
4 converge for t ≫1 to the ﬁxed-point solutions obtained
from Eqs. (38) and (39). The inset of ﬁgure 4 shows numeri-
cal simulations on random graphs generated through both the
conﬁguration model and the effective matrix of Eq. (29) for
the same system size, conﬁrming that the simulation results
obtained from each method are approximately the same for
large values of N and c.
Now we discuss the nonequilibrium dynamics of m(t) and
Var [m(t)] at the critical temperature T = Tc. After an ini-
tial transient that depends on m(0), the average magnetization
m(t) and the variance Var [m(t)] become independent of the
initial conditions for large t and they exhibit, respectively, the

z1 = 1/2κ and z2 = 1/κ, where κ controls the power-law
tails of µa(ζ). Figure 5 illustrates the critical dynamics of
m(t) and Var [m(t)] for κ = 2. For an hyperbolic tangent
distribution µh(ζ), the exponents are given by z1 = 1/2 and
z2 = 1. These are the standard mean-ﬁeld values for the criti-
cal dynamics of purely dissipative systems (models with non-
conserved order-parameter) [39, 40]. Note that z1 and z2 have
the same values as the critical indexes that govern the station-
ary critical behavior (see Eqs. (44-47)). The inset of ﬁgure
5-(a) clearly shows that z1 and z2 are independent of the vari-
ance 1/α of the negative binomial degree distribution.
Lastly, we investigate how degree ﬂuctuations and the dis-
tribution of thresholds inﬂuence the dynamics of m(t) inside
each phase. For an arbitrary initial condition 0 < m(0) < 1,
the magnetization ﬂows exponentially fast to its stationary
state m, namely
|m(t) −m| ∝e−t/τ
(t ≫1).

Close to a critical point, the relaxation time τ typically be-
haves as [10]
τ ∝ξZ,
(50)
where ξ is the correlation length and Z deﬁnes a dynami-
cal exponent. In the homogeneous mean-ﬁeld Ising model,
the correlation length and the relaxation time diverge, respec-
tively, as ξ ∝|T −Tc|−1/2 and τ ∝|T −Tc|−1, which implies
that Z = 2 [10]. Below we examine the critical scaling of τ
in the present model.

tion, the relaxation time diverges as τ(α) ∝|α −αc|−1, inde-
pendently of the distribution of thresholds. For ﬁxed α, τ(T)
also diverges as τ(T) ∝|T −Tc|−1, regardless the shape of
µ(ζ). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that Z = 2 in the
present model, independently of the degree distribution and
of the distribution of thresholds.

FINAL REMARKS
We have presented an exact solution for the dynamics of
the Ising model on highly-connected random graphs with an
arbitrary degree distribution. The spins are updated in par-
allel according to a stochastic dynamical rule which depends
on a threshold noise that emulates the contact of the system
with a thermal bath. For certain choices of the distribution of
thresholds, the microscopic stationary states of the dynamics
do not follow the Boltzmann distribution, which rules out the
application of equilibrium statistical mechanics.
The solution of the model is given in terms of a general
dynamical equation for the distribution of local magnetiza-
tions, which encapsulates all information about the effect of
both degree and threshold ﬂuctuations in the behavior of the

αc = 1 (see Eq. (40)) from the (a) ferromagnetic and from the (b)
paramagnetic phase. The quantity 1/α is the relative variance of the
negative binomial degree distribution. Each data point is obtained by
ﬁtting the long-time dynamics of m(t), derived from the recurrence
Eqs. (19) and (22), with the exponential function of Eq. (49).
system. The theoretical results for the stationary as well as
for the nonequilibrium dynamics of the average magnetiza-
tion have been validated by numerical simulations of the mi-
croscopic dynamics. In addition, our numerical simulations
have conﬁrmed that the interaction matrix of the Ising model
on graphs sampled from the conﬁguration model converges
to the suitable matrix decomposition of Eq. (29) in the high-
connectivity limit. This equation enables to simulate the Ising
model on networks with an arbitrary degree distribution with-
out resorting to more sophisticated algorithms to sample graph
instances [44]. We have shown that the model undergoes a
continuous transition between a paramagnetic and a ferromag-
netic phase.
We have presented results for random graphs with a
negative binomial degree distribution, in which the high-
connectivity limit is solely parameterized by the variance of
the rescaled degrees. In particular, we have focused on the
critical exponents that characterize the stationary critical be-
havior and the long-time critical dynamics of the mean and
the variance of the local magnetizations. Our main result is
to show that these critical exponents depend on the distribu-
tion of the threshold noise. If the distribution of thresholds is
such that the model evolves to equilibrium states, then both
exponents assume their standard mean-ﬁeld values [10]. In
contrast, if the distribution of thresholds is such that the sta-
tionary states do not follow the Boltzmann distribution, then
the aforementioned critical exponents may depend on the ﬂuc-
tuations of the threshold noise. Remarkably, in the case of
an algebraic threshold noise both critical exponents are deter-
mined by the power-law tails of the distribution of thresholds.

In addition, we have shown that the dynamical exponent for
the relaxation time of the average magnetization inside each
phase always assumes its standard mean-ﬁeld value, regard-
less the distribution of the threshold noise. Overall, our results
show that the details of the microscopic dynamics and the ab-
sence of detailed balance are relevant factors in determining
the universality classes of spin models, in line with the critical
properties of other nonequilibrium systems [10]. Still, the fact
that the critical properties of the global magnetization do not
belong to the mean-ﬁeld universality class is somewhat sur-
prising, given that random graphs can be seen as the inﬁnite
dimensional, mean-ﬁeld limit of ﬁnite-dimensional lattices.
Although the values of all critical exponents studied here
are independent of the degree ﬂuctuations, we point out that
all moments of the negative binomial degree distribution are
ﬁnite. It is well established that, in the case of scale-free net-
works, the equilibrium critical scaling of the magnetization
depends on the power-law decay of the degree distribution [9]
when its fourth moment diverges. In this respect, it would
be very interesting to consider the nonequilibrium dynam-
ics of the Ising model on scale-free networks and understand
whether strong degree heterogeneities are able to modify the
dynamical exponents of spin models.
The probabilistic approach discussed here is general
enough that it can be adapted to study the parallel as well as
the sequential dynamics of other agent-based models of inter-
acting binary variables on undirected networks [3, 13, 36, 37].
For sequential dynamics, in which a single spin is updated at
each time step, there is an extra critical index that describes the
short-time, non-monotonic critical dynamics of spin models
[39, 49]. Our work paves the way to understand whether net-
work heterogeneities change this critical exponent in mean-
ﬁeld models. We leave this and other aforementioned prob-
lems as interesting perspectives of future works.

Appendix A: Solution via the generating functional approach
In this appendix we present a more rigorous derivation of
Eqs. (19) and (22) based on the generating functional ap-
proach [12, 45]. The time-dependent local ﬁeld is deﬁned by
Eq. (2). We assume that the entries Cij of the adjacency ma-
trix C are generated according to
Cij = c
N GiGj(1 −δij),
(A1)
where G1, . . . , GN are independent random variables drawn
from the rescaled degree distribution ν(g). The above effec-
tive matrix C has been put forward in section III based on the
asymptotic form of the local ﬁeld for c →∞. Here we take
Eq. (A1) as the deﬁnition of the adjacency matrix elements
and the starting point of our derivations, from which we will
re-obtain the recurrence equation for the magnetization. The
calculations in this appendix further conﬁrm that Eq. (A1) is
the correct form of C for c →∞.
Our aim is to compute the disorder averaged generating

the functional Φ[u, v, ˆu, ˆv] with respect to its arguments and

The last step consists in simplifying the saddle-point equa-

Eq. (2), and then performing the same calculation that led us
to the above saddle-point integral, one ﬁnds that the single-site

in such a way that the order-parameter v(s) can be written
