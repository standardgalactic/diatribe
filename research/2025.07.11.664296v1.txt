Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the structure of the brain, offers advantages in 
parallel processing, memory storage, and energy efficiency. However, current 
semiconductor-based neuromorphic chips require rare-earth materials and costly 
fabrication processes, whereas neural organoids need complex bioreactor maintenance. This 
study explores shiitake (Lentinula edodes) fungi as a robust, sustainable alternative, 
exploiting its adaptive electrical signaling, which is akin to neuronal spiking. We 
demonstrate fungal computing via mycelial networks interfaced with electrodes, showing 
that fungal memristors can be grown, trained, and preserved through dehydration, retaining 
functionality at frequencies up to 6 kHz. Notably, shiitake has exhibited radiation resistance, 
suggesting its viability for aerospace applications. Our findings show that fungal computers 
can provide scalable, eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks, bridging bioelectronics 
and unconventional computing.

Background
Overview
Artificial intelligence and neural networks are predicted to be the largest drivers of energy demand 
in the near future. Embodied intelligence, which uses hardware-based local neural networks, is a 
possible solution. These systems require ready access to large numbers of memristors, a type of 
electronic device that can retain information when the power is turned off, which have shown 
promise in enhancing the performance of computing systems. However, the manufacturing and 
disposal processes of conventional memristors contribute to electronic waste and environmental 
degradation. This context has led to interest in creating memristors using natural, biodegradable 
materials such as fungi. 
Memristors
Memristor devices offer substantial advantages in robotic, industrial, and transport applications 
due to their unique electrical properties and ability to mimic neural functions. They can enhance 
various control systems, facilitate efficient information processing, and ultimately improve the 
overall performance of autonomous systems.
One of the key strengths of memristors is their capacity for efficient and self-adaptive in situ 
learning, which is critical for applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. In memristor-
based neural networks, the devices can adjust their resistance according to previous inputs, 
allowing for a form of analog learning that closely resembles synaptic behavior in biological 
systems1. This capability enables robots and autonomous vehicles to learn from their environment 
and adapt in real time, enhancing their ability to navigate complex situations effectively. Studies

have found that such systems can achieve low-latency responses, which are essential for high-
speed decision-making in dynamic environments2.
Memristors also provide the advantage of integrating memory and processing capabilities into a 
single device, enabling a simplified architecture for autonomous control systems3. For instance, in 
autonomous vehicles, trajectory-tracking and path-following tasks can be performed using 
memristor-based controllers that allow for rapid calculations and real-time adjustments to control 
variables4. This integration, especially with parallelization, helps to address the challenges posed 
by separate memory and processing units, which can lead to delays and increased power 
consumption in traditional control systems4.
Additionally, the resilience of memristor devices against environmental changes and their ability 
to operate under varying conditions make them particularly suitable for autonomous applications, 
such as vehicles operating in unpredictable road environments4. This is complemented by the 
precision in control that memristor-based systems can offer, which is significant for maintaining 
stability and performance while following desired trajectories5.
Moreover, the low power consumption of memristors is particularly beneficial in robotics and 
autonomous vehicles, where energy efficiency is paramount. Hybrid analog-digital memristor 
systems can minimize power usage during processing without sacrificing responsiveness, which 
can prolong operational time by reducing the frequency at which recharging or battery replacement 
is required, enhancing the feasibility of deploying such systems in mobile applications2.

Ultimately, the potential of memristors to emulate human-like decision-making and learning 
processes could be exploited to endow robotic systems and autonomous vehicles with 
functionalities not found in conventional control systems. The ability of memristors to perform 
complex computations efficiently, learn adaptively, and integrate both memory and processing 
into a unified approach make them a cornerstone technology for the future development of 
intelligent autonomous systems. However, memristors often require rare-earth minerals and 
expensive semiconductor foundries to produce.
Fungal Electronics
Fungi possess innate abilities to adapt to various environmental conditions and efficiently process 
information through their interconnected network of hyphae. These characteristics make fungi an 
ideal candidate for developing sustainable computing systems. We aim to design and implement a 
novel fungal memristor-based computing architecture that can significantly reduce energy 
consumption and minimize electronic waste. We can achieve this with substantially simpler 
bioreactors and nutrient cultures than those required for conventional neurons and neural 
organoids. The unique advantages of fungal memristors stem from the biological properties of 
fungal materials, which distinguish them from typical inorganic or polymer alternatives6,7.
First, one of the main benefits of fungal memristors is their environmentally sustainable and 
biodegradable nature. Conventional memristors often contain transition metal oxides or silicon-
based structures, whose production or disposal may pose environmental challenges6,7. In contrast, 
fungal materials are derived from organic biomass, making them both sustainable and significantly 
less harmful to the environment. This aligns with the increasing efforts toward developing greener 
and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

electronic materials, as highlighted in prior work emphasizing the importance of sustainability in 
technology development8.
Second, fungal memristors exhibit remarkable adaptability in their electrical properties. The 
structural composition of fungal materials often allows for a range of conductive pathways that 
can form dynamically under the influence of electrical stimuli, similar to the conductive filaments 
formed in conventional memristors9,10. This adaptability can lead to enhanced performance in 
neuromorphic applications by facilitating variable resistance states that mimic synaptic behaviors 
more closely than traditional memristive materials, which often have static crystalline structures 
that can lead to variability problems or performance limitations at the nanoscale11.
Furthermore, fungal memristors may consume less power than traditional materials due to their 
unique electrochemical properties. Prior researchers have claimed that some organic materials, 
including those derived from fungi, can operate effectively at lower voltages while maintaining 
stable switching characteristics, a trait that is crucial for developing energy-efficient devices for 
portable electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) applications12. This can significantly extend 
battery life and reduce energy costs in processing and memory applications, which have become 
focal points in research into neuromorphic systems13.
Finally, the natural composition and multicellularity of fungal materials can lead to more 
naturalistic models for neural networks. Because these materials are subject to biological 
processes, they may inherently incorporate characteristics that resemble biological neuronal 
networks, including plasticity and memory capabilities that could evolve with usage. This

biological mimicry could strengthen the development of more advanced artificial neural networks, 
enabling applications such as adaptive learning systems and intelligent sensor networks14.
Fungus Types
The potential use of shiitake (Lentinula edodes) and button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) as 
organic memristors is an emerging area of research that exploits the unique properties of these 
fungi. Memristors, which are non-volatile memory devices that retain information even without 
power, can benefit from the porous structures and electrical properties of organic materials derived 
from mushrooms.
Shiitake mushrooms have been shown to possess a hierarchically porous carbon structure when 
activated. This porous structure can enhance the electrochemical performance of devices, making 
them suitable candidates for use in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors and 
potentially memristors15. The creation of highly conductive carbon materials from shiitake has 
been demonstrated, suggesting that these materials could be engineered to exhibit memristive 
behavior16. Shiitake-derived carbon is a sustainable alternative to traditional materials and can 
enhance the performance of electronic devices due to its unique structural properties.
Button mushrooms have also shown significant potential in this context. Research has indicated 
that their porosity can be exploited to create materials with high surface areas, which are essential 
for the development of efficient electronic components17. The synthesis of carbon composites from 
button mushrooms has been explored, revealing their ability to function effectively in energy 
and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.

storage applications17. Furthermore, the integration of button mushrooms into electronic systems 
has been investigated, demonstrating their potential as substrates for electronic devices18.
In addition to their structural properties, the unique biological characteristics of fungi, including 
their ability to interact with various chemical compounds, can be harnessed to develop novel 
sensing technologies. For instance, electronic noses have been developed that use mushroom 
extracts to detect volatile compounds; these could be adapted for use in electronic devices that 
require environmental sensing capabilities19,20. This intersection of biology and electronics opens 
new avenues for creating multifunctional devices that incorporate the sensory capabilities of 
mushrooms.
Radiation Resistance and Resilience
The radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms has been studied primarily in terms of their ability 
to withstand and possibly derive benefits from exposure to ionizing radiation. This resistance can 
be attributed to several biochemical and physiological attributes. A possible factor is lentinan, a 
polysaccharide found in the cell walls of shiitake. Lentinan provides structural integrity and 
exhibits immunomodulatory effects that may enhance the mushroom's ability to respond to 
environmental stresses, including radiation exposure. Although some research suggests that 
lentinan possesses properties that may help mitigate oxidative stress21, studies directly linking 
lentinan to radiation resistance in shiitake mushrooms are limited.
Shiitake mushrooms have also shown a notable ability to adapt to their environmental conditions, 
including variable radiation levels. Studies involving fungi in space research indicate that certain

fungi can enhance their survival through morphological changes or increased melanin production 
in response to radiation22. This research has not specifically addressed shiitake, but the general 
adaptability observed in fungi suggests that this species could respond similarly to such conditions.
Another example of the resilience of shiitake mushrooms is their ability to maintain their 
nutritional and bioactive qualities after irradiation. For example, they retain essential nutrients and 
bioactive compounds even after exposure to ultraviolet radiation23. The high content of ergosterol, 
a precursor to vitamin D, found in shiitake mushrooms, reinforces their potential for beneficial 
outcomes following exposure to radiation, as this compound can be converted into vitamin D2 
when subjected to ultraviolet light24.
Lastly, shiitake mushrooms can be considered in the development of dietary supplements or 
functional foods that might serve a broader purpose in radioprotection. Their multirole efficacy as 
a food source and electrical component emphasizes a sustainable approach to utilizing biological 
entities that can withstand environmental stresses, including radiation. This is especially relevant 
in aerospace and exploration contexts, where promoting health in astronauts could reduce the risks 
associated with increased radiation exposure during missions22. Lastly, shiitake mushrooms can 
withstand environmental stresses, including radiation, while remaining safe for human 
consumption. 
In summary, the radiation resistance of shiitake mushrooms is linked to the presence of protective 
compounds like lentinan and their ability to adapt morphologically. These factors contribute to

understanding their survival strategies and suggest potential applications in areas where radiation 
exposure is a significant concern. 
Methods
Hyphal Cultivation
Due to the financial and environmental constraints of this project, all memristors fabricated during 
experimentation were composed exclusively of low-cost, organic materials. Drawing from prior 
research, materials such as biocompatible composites25 were identified as viable candidates for 
device construction and programming due to their biodegradability and compatibility with fungal 
growth.
The initial phase of experimentation focused on the cultivation of fungal hyphae within the 
selected organic growth media. Nine samples were prepared in standard polycarbonate petri 
dishes. The growth conditions were carefully maintained to promote optimal fungal development, 
with a controlled temperature range of 20-22°C, a relative humidity of 70%, and mixed light 
exposure to replicate natural terrestrial conditions. The nutrient substrate consisted of a mixture of 
farro seed, wheat germ, and hay, selected for their organic composition and ability to support 
robust fungal growth. Each sample was inoculated with spores or mycelial plugs of shiitake.
As shown in Figure 1, the samples were observed and documented biweekly to track their growth 
consistency and morphological development. Observations such as hyphal density, surface 
coverage, and color changes were recorded in a structured laboratory logbook. The log included 
timestamps and qualitative notes, enabling consistent comparison across samples and time points.

Drying and Rehydration Process
Once full hyphal coverage and structural maturation were achieved when the petri dish was 
covered, the samples were transitioned to a drying phase. The petri dishes were placed in a well-
ventilated area under direct sunlight for approximately seven days, ensuring uniform dehydration. 
The samples were rotated periodically to avoid uneven hardening. As claimed by prior work, this 
process transformed the fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining its overall 
shape and connectivity.27

Prior to testing, the samples were rehydrated using a fine mist of aerosolized deionized water. This 
step restored the required level of conductivity without introducing bulk moisture that could alter 
their mechanical integrity.
Electrical Characterization
Electrical testing protocols were designed in accordance with theoretical memristors. 6,7 An 
alternating current (AC) was applied to each sample, and the corresponding current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristics were measured using a digital oscilloscope.

To extract accurate current values, a known shunt resistor was placed in series with each sample. 
As shown in Figure 2, voltage readings were captured across both the sample and the resistor, with 
Channel 1 of the oscilloscope measuring the input voltage and Channel 2 capturing the voltage 
drop across the shunt resistor. Current values were then calculated using Kirchhoff's current law, 
allowing derivation of the I-V characteristics from voltage differentials. All waveform data were 
exported in comma-separated values (CSV) format for subsequent digital analysis and 
visualization. 
To investigate the memristive behavior of the samples thoroughly, voltage sweeps were conducted 
using both square and sinusoidal waveforms. Square waves were employed to detect sharp 
threshold-based resistance changes, whereas sinusoidal inputs provided insight into more subtle, 
continuous mem-fractive behaviors. This dual approach enabled the identification of hysteresis 
loops in the I-V curves, a key signature of memristor functionality.
Hypothesis
The general testing setup, informed by prior literature, can indicate whether the fungal samples are 
capable of exhibiting memristive behavior. If present, this behavior would manifest as a 
characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I-V curves, typically intersecting at or near the origin, 
a well-established signature of memristive systems. This study hypothesized that such a response 
would emerge under specific combinations of voltage amplitude and input frequency.

Volatile Memory Testing
After experimentally confirming that the fungal samples exhibited memristive behavior, a 
specialized electronic circuit was designed and implemented to investigate the volatile memory 
characteristics of two fungal samples in series. To parallel prior work, the configuration and layout 
of this testing circuit are presented in Figure 3.6
Figure 3. Theoretical volatile memory circuit. The samples were evaluated using this model.
Comparable to prior work in memristive computing, the volatile memory circuit employed an 
Arduino UNO microcontroller development board and a voltage divider consisting of two 
memristive elements. 6,7 Given the polarized nature of memristors, the circuit was designed to 
allow setting a voltage of opposite polarity to that used during read operations. Both voltages used

were approximately 5 V. The Arduino UNO cyclically applied a high signal to a relay containing 
a half-rectified sine wave through one of its digital output pins when reading the memristor bridge, 
thereby charging the divider. This process induced an asymmetry in resistance, with the memristor 
closest to the input experiencing a reduction in resistance, while the output-side memristor 
exhibited an increase. The voltage across the divider was subsequently read using an analog input 
pin, and another digital pin was used to run 5 V across the divider. The Arduino interpreted the 
stored state as "on" only when the measured voltage exceeded a predefined threshold, effectively 
enabling volatile memory detection based on the transient resistance states of the memristors. 
Results were repeated for each sample. The physical implementation of this circuit is shown in 
Figure 4.

5) 1 Vpp at 200 Hz, sine wave
6) 1 Vpp at 100 Hz, sine wave
7) 1 Vpp at 25 Hz sine wave
8) 1 Vpp at 50 Hz, sine wave
9) 1 Vpp at 10 Hz, sine wave
10) 5 Vpp at 10 Hz, sine wave
Voltage Testing
The first five tests were conducted to determine which voltage amplitude produced the most 
favorable memristive response. These initial trials revealed that a 1 V peak-to-peak (Vpp) signal 
yielded the most consistent and measurable results. As outlined in the Methods section, the first 
four of these tests were performed using a square wave input.
Frequency Testing
After identifying 1 Vpp as the optimal input voltage during the initial square wave tests (Tests 1-
4), the waveform was switched to a sine wave for further analysis (Tests 5-10). The objective of 
this phase was to identify the frequency at which memristive behavior, specifically a pinched 
hysteresis loop, became apparent.
Figures 5 through 10 show the output of Tests 2 through 7. The frequency was gradually reduced 
until a crossing near the origin was first observed, as shown in Figure 10. To ensure this result was 
not an outlier caused by overshooting the ideal frequency, the test was repeated at a slightly higher

frequency (50 Hz, Test 8, shown in Figure 11). This confirmed that the optimal response occurred 
below 25 Hz.
Subsequently, the frequency was decreased to 10 Hz (Test 9, shown in Figure 12), which produced 
a clear crossing in the I-V curve near the −0.4 V region. To enhance the visibility of this behavior, 
the voltage was increased to 5 Vpp, resulting in a more pronounced memristive signature (Test 10). 
Figure 13 illustrates this result, displaying a nearly ideal pinched hysteresis loop indicative of 
memristor functionality.
Volatile Memory Experiment
The memristor voltage divider was tested by applying a 5 Vpp sinusoidal signal to the memristors 
for approximately 0.01-0.1 milliseconds. This signal was delivered via a relay triggered by digital 
pin 6 of the Arduino UNO. Following this brief stimulation period, the sinusoidal input was 
disabled, and digital pin 5 was activated to initiate the read phase. Analog voltage measurements 
were then acquired through the A1 analog input pin. To minimize the effects of floating voltages, 
a 1 MΩ pull-down resistor was connected to this pin. Voltage readings were recorded for 
approximately 0.1-0.10 milliseconds before the cycle repeated, allowing for rapid and continuous 
testing of the memristive behavior.
 
The results were transmitted over a serial communication interface at a baud rate of 57,600 and 
captured as raw text files for analysis. The data were post-processed and visualized using a custom 
Python script based on the matplotlib library, enabling clear identification of memory retention

patterns and resistance state changes across successive cycles. The results are shown in Figures 5-
18.
The process and results can be summarized as follows:
•
Tests 1-5: The voltage amplitude was optimized using square waves.
•
Tests 5-6: The waveform was changed from square to sine.
•
Tests 6-10: Frequency sweeps were performed using sine waves to identify memristive 
crossing.
•
Test 11: The voltage range was expanded at 10 Hz (5 Vpp) to enhance the response. This 
showed behavior close to that of an ideal memristor.
•
Test 1: Notably, this showed consistent linear behavior, indicating resistive behavior.
•
Volatile Tests 1-2: Single read and write operations were performed across the memristor 
voltage divider.

Discussion
Overview
Using low-cost materials, shiitake mushrooms were cultured into ideal memristors. Ideal and non-
ideal memristive properties have been observed previously in fungi, but these required far more 
complex interfacing methods26. Although several techniques have been proposed to preserve 
fungal samples, we have obtained experimental validation that dehydration can preserve the 
observed properties in a previously "programmed" sample27. Ideal memristor properties are 
observed at lower frequencies, but potential latencies can be offset through massive parallelization,

as in nature26. As with prior work on fungal memristors, the mycelial structure contains capacitive, 
memfractive, and memristive proteins.25,26 The observed rapid switching speed of 6000 Hz, low 
energy consumption, light weight, and radiation resistance all make fungal memristors attractive 
for edge computing, aerospace, and embedded firmware applications. Unlike expensive 
conventional memristors, culturing fungal memristors does not require large facilities or rare 
minerals. The process can be scaled to grow larger systems, which can be programmed and 
preserved for long-term use, at a low cost.
Limitations
The current study had limitations due to its relatively short timescale of less than two months. 
Other researchers have documented memristive properties in mycelial materials, but their studies 
have also focused on short-term performance26. Another limitation was that only single, relatively 
bulky samples were prepared. To truly compete with conventional devices at the microscale and 
below, memristors would need to be far smaller7,8,11. However, the development of these devices 
is at an early stage, and they could eventually be miniaturized, especially with improved cultivation 
techniques. Complications associated with the growth media were not explored, although prior 
research has found that fungi are quite robust to varying conditions26.
Future Work
Although fungal memristors can be produced at a low cost, certain aspects of the process could be 
optimized further. First, cultivation techniques could be improved using 3D-printed templates and 
structures that shape the shiitake mushroom into a desired geometry. Second, programming could 
be facilitated by adding electrical contacts into a 3D-printed cultivation structure. Finally, long-

term use would necessitate preservation, which could involve a variety of techniques: dehydration, 
desiccation, freeze-drying, certain hydrogels, and special coatings27. A combination of these 
techniques could enable the development of fast, radiation-resistant, and low-energy memristors 
grown from low-cost organic materials. The future of computing could be fungal.
Conclusions
The fabrication of existing semiconductor memristors requires rare-earth minerals and large 
facilities. Culturing delicate neural organoids requires a complex chemical environment to be 
maintained in a bioreactor. Fungal computing may provide a robust and accessible alternative. 
Fungal systems have lower power requirements, lighter weights, faster switching speeds, and 
lower industrial overheads than conventional devices. In this study, fungal memristors were 
fabricated, programmed, and tested using shiitake mushrooms and conventional electronics. 
Dehydration-based preservation was successfully explored, demonstrating the robustness of our 
devices. When used as RAM, our mushroom memristor was able to operate at up to 6000 Hz. 
Shiitake mushrooms are biodegradable and have demonstrated radiation resistance, suggesting that 
the potential applications of fungal computing range from sustainable computing devices to 
aerospace technologies.
