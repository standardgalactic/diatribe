In this paper, we propose a Learning-based Ensemble Method with Optimal selection strategy (LbEM-OSS), 
which presents a new outlier detection algorithm that captures only outstanding ones of constituent models. 
Using KNN to define local regions and Pearson correlation to evaluate the detectors makes the ensemble 
robust. Our method can adapt and generalize better across different high-dimensional datasets by generating 
pseudo-ground truths with average and maximum aggregation strategies. On a wide range of benchmark 
datasets, LbEM-OSS outperformed both statistics-based and neural ensemble methods, which achieved state-
of-the-art ROC-AUC as high as 97.78% in the best-case and 4-8% AUC improvements over existing methods 
on average. These results portray its potential for noise, different dimensionality,  and heterogeneous data 
nature. Moreover, it is highly scalable and accurate, which makes it an essential application in practical 
fields like fraud detection, network security, and healthcare. This research highlights the need for dynamic 
selection approaches within ensemble methods, providing the groundwork for future developments in sound 
outlier detection.

1   Introduction 
Outlier detection, a necessary part of data analysis, allows 
the identification of data points with significantly different 
values than the rest of the data set. Let's start with outliers. 
They can corrupt statistical studies and machine learning 
models; if they are not correctly handled, they can lead to 
incorrect results. Several statistical methods exist for 
outlier detection, including the Z-score,  Tukey's fences, 
and isolation forests. For instance, anomaly detection is 
essential in the finance industry, fraud detection, and 
healthcare [1], [2]. Ensemble methods are necessary for 
improving the accuracy and robustness of outlier detection 
schemes, especially in high-dimensional data scenarios, as 
many features cause the problem of dimensionality curse 
and lead to higher complexity and noise than conventional 
outlier identification methods usually obtain robustness. 
To mitigate this problem, ensemble techniques combine 
several outlier detection algorithms to provide a final 
prediction that is more reliable and accurate. Ensemble 
methods reduce the impact of the shortcomings of 
individual models and offer a more holistic assessment of 
outliers in high-dimensional data by aggregating the 
results of several models [4], [5], [6]. Existing literature 
suggests that constituent outlier detection models play a 
crucial role in shaping an ensemble-based method's 
effectiveness for multiple reasons [10]. These models 
help detect and treat outliers in the dataset to avoid 
damaging the performance of the machine learning 
models. Ensemble models aggregate their predictions, 
which allows them to find outliers and minimize their 
effect, influencing the total accuracy. Moreover, the 
individual models may be over-fitted, and outliers alter the 
noise, but including the robust outlier-detection models in 
the ensemble strengthens them against noisy data. 
Additionally, by concentrating on the most significant data 
points, 
outlier 
detection 
encourages 
improved 
generalization, allowing the model to learn from 
representative instances, which enhances its forecasting 
capabilities on unseen data. Moreover, these models have 
provided additional information on the outliers' features, 
which 
helps 
improve 
the 
ensemble 
model's 
interpretability. As such, constituent outlier detection 
models are essential components of ensemble-based 
methodologies, leading to more accurate, robust, well-
generalizing, and transparent insights into the data.

Ensemble methods are a new and powerful tool in the 
outlier detection arsenal, combining multiple models to 
harness each model's strengths to produce robust and 
accurate results. K-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Local 
Outlier Factor (LOF) are some of the key algorithms used 
in such methods. The kNN algorithm is effective for 
describing an isolated area using only k-nearest data points 
since it centers more on the local neighborhood structure 
of the data, which is especially helpful for anomaly 
detection. Similarly, LOF assesses the local density of a 
point compared to its neighbors and marks points with a 
substantially lower local density as outliers. They are 
complementary in that each method provides a solution for 
the diversity problem of the datasets with different 
characteristics, and integrating those methods into 
ensemble frameworks is the foundation of the proposed 
approach. 
This paper presents the following contributions: We 
introduce a new algorithm named the Learning-based 
Ensemble Method with Optimal Selection Strategy 
(LbEM-OSS), focusing on the dynamic selection of top-
performing constituent models to achieve a more robust 
outlier detection result. This would ensure that separate 
methods such as K-Nearest neighbors (KNN)-based 
models, Isolation Forests, and statistical outlier detection 
methods are rated based on their local and global relevance 
for being part of an ensemble. We use average and 
maximum aggregation strategies to generate pseudo-
ground truths for this empirical evaluation. By calculating 
global and local ground truths, our algorithm reaches better 
accuracy, further improving adjustment to various high-
dimensional datasets. The algorithm's performance is 
validated by several empirical studies conducted on 
benchmark datasets (re0, Sun09, Shuttle),  and the 
algorithm produces the highest AUC score of 97.78%. Our 
proposed method can be used for fraud detection, 
healthcare, and network security applications and provides 
a reliable automatic outlier detection algorithm for 
complex data environments. The rest of the paper is 
organized as follows: The introduction summarizes the 
literature on various ensemble methods and information 
acquisition strategies. In Section 3, we propose an outlier 
detection algorithm. Section 4 examines the proposed 
method in experiments performed on some high-
dimensional datasets. Section 5 presents a conclusion and 
suggests future research avenues.

In this section, research on existing ensemble learning 
approaches for outlier detection. Chakraborty et al. [1] 
proposed an innovative approach to outlier detection by 
integrating probabilistic neural networks and layered 
autoencoders, particularly addressing scenarios with 
multiple outliers and class imbalance. This method 
enhances detection accuracy by leveraging deep learning 
techniques for robust feature extraction. However, the 
study lacks dynamic selection mechanisms tailored for 
dataset-specific characteristics addressed in our proposed 
LbEM-OSS algorithm through KNN-based local regions 
and Pearson correlation evaluation. Reunanen et al. [2] 
suggested maximizing the selectivity and efficiency of 
outlier detection ensembles by using fewer instances. Our 
method adjusts parameters to yield a wide range of precise 
outcomes, which is advantageous for different algorithms. 
Boukerche et al. [3], significant research has addressed 
different difficulties over the last ten years by 
concentrating on effective outlier identification strategies. 
We classify new techniques, review their features, 
benefits, and drawbacks, and look at possible future 
developments.  Zhong et al. [4] state that network traffic 
anomaly detection is essential for network security, but 
current approaches have problems with complexity, 
flexibility, and retraining. HELAD surpasses others by 
using deep learning algorithms—Abbasi et al. [5] required 
due to the increased data flow by flexible solution. 
ElStream outperforms traditional techniques in the 
detection of idea drifts using ensemble learning. 
Fitriyani et al. [6] introduced an ensemble learning 
model 
for 
predicting 
diabetes 
and 
hypertension, 
integrating the system into a smartphone app for real-time 
diagnosis. While achieving high accuracy, the study 
focused on supervised ensemble methods and did not 
address unsupervised or semi-supervised scenarios 
common in outlier detection. Our approach builds on this 
by enhancing unsupervised ensemble techniques for high-
dimensional datasets, thus broadening applicability. 
Schubert et al. [7] proposed a generalized outlier detection 
framework using flexible kernel density estimates, 
enabling the identification of anomalies in diverse data 
distributions without relying on rigid assumptions. Their 
approach demonstrates robustness in high-dimensional 
datasets, making it particularly relevant for ensemble-
based outlier detection methods that enhance accuracy and 
adaptability. Zhang et al. [8] described utilizing stacking 
ensemble learning and multi-dimensional feature fusion in 
MFFSEM for intrusion detection. MFFSEM works better 
on a variety of datasets than current approaches. Li et al. 
[9] investigated Ps prediction using a Ps dataset and 
dimensionality reduction using four ensemble approaches. 
The results show the advantage of ensemble techniques. 
Zhu et al. [10] suggested a method for detecting intrusions 
on Internet of Things networks that combines ensemble 
learning with subspace clustering. It performs better than 
current techniques, with few false positives and excellent 
accuracy.  
Ouyang et al. [11] improved machine learning 
analysis efficiency by introducing an EBOD approach for 
real-world datasets. Zhang et al. [12] presented DELR, a 
double-level ensemble approach to anomaly detection that 
aims to improve generalization capacity by tackling 
diversity 
and 
information 
loss. 
Suggested 
future 
enhancements include deep learning integration and real-
time optimization, and DELR beats state-of-the-art 
algorithms on real-world datasets. Wang and Mao [13] 
addressed issues in process monitoring by introducing a 
dynamic ensemble outlier identification approach with 
one-class classifiers. Rigorous studies show its usefulness 
and future studies might focus on potential enhancements. 
Wang and Mao et al. [14] addressed ensemble difficulties 
by putting forth a dynamic outlier identification strategy

that makes use of one-class classifiers. Experimental data 
demonstrate its efficacy over static ensembles and single 
models. The goal of more studies is to close the oracle's 
performance gap. Aljame et al. [15] used standard blood 
testing; early diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential. 
Combining classifiers improves predictions in an 
ensemble model called ERLX. The diversity of datasets 
and model validation continues to be challenged. 
Zhang et al. [16] enhanced using a hybrid ensemble 
model that combines balanced sampling and outlier 
identification. In terms of prediction, it does better than 
benchmarks. Mienye et al. [17] improved across various 
domains 
through 
ensemble 
learning, 
integrating 
predictions from numerous models. Popular algorithms, 
including XGBoost and Random Forest, as well as 
bagging, boosting, and stacking techniques, are covered in 
this review. Yin et al. [18] employed 246 data sets and the 
stacking 
approach 
of 
ensemble 
learning. 
Outlier 
management and dimension reduction were incorporated 
into the preprocessing. An eight-model comparison 
revealed the advantage of ensemble models, mainly when 
dealing with skewed data. Tsai and Lin [19] evaluated 55 
datasets to solve imbalanced class learning. OCC 
ensembles enhance performance. The influence of feature 
selection and multi-class unbalanced datasets will be 
investigated in future studies. Bull et al. [20] compared to 
supervised 
approaches, 
outlier 
ensembles 
perform 
comparably in damage identification and dimension 
reduction. Real-world engineering examples show how 
effective they are.  
Zhang et al. [21] used for credit scoring have been 
altered by AI. In addition to improving feature 
interpretability and automatically optimizing parameters, a 
unique ensemble model handles outliers. Subudhi and 
Panigrahi [22] suggested a database security-focused 
intrusion detection system that combines OPTICS 
clustering and ensemble learning. Empirical findings 
demonstrate its advantages. Eddine et al. [23] used feature 
engineering and an RF classifier to create an intrusion 
detection model with excellent accuracy for IIoT security. 
Rovetta et al. [24] identified potentially dangerous 
occurrences in road audio streams. A novel ensemble 
approach 
combining 
one-class 
SVM 
for 
outlier 
identification and DNN for event classification shows 
promise. Cheng et al. [25] improved efficiency and 
accuracy with a two-layer ensemble technique that 
combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for precise 
outlier identification with Isolation Forest (iForest) for 
rapid scanning and trimming.  
Hus et al. [26] suggest that a stacked ensemble ANIDS 
using AE, SVM, and RF models be used for network 
intrusion detection. Tested on actual campus logs, NSL-
KDD, and UNSW-NB15 datasets, it performs better than 
conventional models, decreasing incorrect predictions. 
Wei et al. [27] defend against adversarial assaults and out-
of-distribution inputs. XEnsemble, a technique for DNN 
models, combines input and output verification. Biswas 
and Samanta [28], with Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and 
kNN as essential learners, use ERF to address finding 
anomalies in wireless sensor networks. The AReM dataset 
evaluation reveals that ERF performs better than 
individual 
learners. 
In 
the 
future, 
multi-class 
categorization could be used. Jiang et al. [29], outlier 
identification in the Internet of Things is challenging 
because of resource limitations and wireless transmission. 
With an emphasis on their performance and unresolved 
research concerns, this review contrasts machine learning-
based methods for outlier detection. Tsogbaatar et al. [30] 
used SDN to anticipate device state, manage flows, and 
identify abnormalities; the deep ensemble learning 
framework DeL-IoT tackles IoT risks.

Khare et al. [34] investigated the use of ensemble ML for

machine learning, namely ANNODE, to identify reliable 
outliers in environmental sensor networks. It has been 
verified using actual datasets and has outperformed 
competing solutions.  
Liu et al. [36] addressed sparsity in high-dimensional

strategy is expanded by MO-GAAL, which outperforms

a unique approach to anomaly detection for GSHP systems 
that combines statistical modeling and deep learning. 
Anomalies

demonstrating the efficacy of the approach. Future studies 
will improve the evaluation of anomaly severity. Kapucu 
et al. [38] suggested a way for photovoltaic systems to 
diagnose faults using ensemble learning that increases 
generalization and classification accuracy. Khasha et al. 
[39] determined asthma control levels, a revolutionary 
ensemble learning technique that integrates machine 
learning algorithms with the experience of clinicians. Chai 
et al. [40] use human input, human-in-the-loop outlier 
detection, or HOD, to detect outliers precisely. To reduce 
human labor, HOD uses a bipartite graph-based technique 
with clustering to provide context inliers. Experimental 
data confirm the advantage of HOD. The literature showed 
a need to develop the best selection strategy for finding 
constituent outlier detection models to be part of an 
ensemble approach. Breunig et al. [41] introduced the LOF 
(Local Outlier Factor) method, which identifies outliers 
based on the local density deviation of a data point 
compared to its neighbors. This approach effectively 
handles varying densities within datasets, making it a 
foundational technique for local region-based outlier 
detection and ensemble methods leveraging neighborhood 
information.  As seen in Table 1, existing ensemble 
methods often struggle with scalability, adaptive detector 
selection, and achieving high accuracy across diverse 
datasets. These limitations underline the necessity for our 
novel selection strategy, which integrates KNN-based 
local region definition and Pearson correlation for dynamic 
detector evaluation, achieving significantly higher 
performance. Table 2 summarizes the literature findings, 
while Table 3 presents the datasets used in the literature. 
The literature review observed that performance needs to 
be improved in selecting appropriate detection methods for 
ensemble 
models 
to 
enhance 
outlier 
detection 
effectiveness. Luo et al. (2021) developed a convolutional 
neural network (CNN) to autonomously identify acute 
ischemic stroke in brain magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) data. [42] Test results revealed that the designed 
model significantly outperformed the pre-improvement 
model in the social network data recommendation task.

Unsupervised learning is key in identifying outliers 
and critical in multiple domains, such as fraud detection, 
network security, or quality assurance. It does not require 
labeled data and is usually used for clustering, density 
estimation, etc. It helps prevent fraud by identifying 
outliers, network security, and high-quality goods & 
services. Unsupervised outlier detection not only helps 
maintain the health and reliability of data-driven systems, 

176   Informatica 49 (2025) 171-192                                                                                                             G.R. Ginni et al. 
but it also helps identify strange or dubious data points far 
from the mean. Outlier Detection - Clustering-based 
unsupervised learning is essential in outlier detection, as it 
identifies any data point that does not fit the expected 
pattern or any cluster of the data set. Using clustering to 
identify groups of similar data points makes it possible to 
identify outliers (i.e., single data points that do not belong 
to any cluster or single data points spread out amongst 
identified clusters). This technique helps find anomalies in 
massive data sets that are impossible to check manually. 
When we use hierarchical clustering to detect outliers, the 
result may consist of clustering algorithms like K-means, 
DBSCAN, and data points from outside the clusters, which 
are probably outliers. These exceptions may be mistakes 
in data assembly, fraud, or once-in-a-lifetime occurrences 
that may fascinate analysts. This clustering-based 
unsupervised learning approach can assist organizations in 
boosting the quality of their data, tighten up fraud 
detection, and allow organizations to unlock insights from 
unusual data points. 
 
 
Figure 1: Ensemble learning-based framework 
 
Figure 1 is the proposed ensemble learning-based 
framework to improve outlier detection performance. The 
process begins with high-dimensional data. Pre-processing 
is applied to the high-dimensional data. Each detector 
computes the training outlier score, updates the outlier 
score matrix, and creates a global ground truth by 
averaging using the training data. The testing data is 
utilized for every test instance throughout the testing 
process. Use the KNN ensemble to characterize the

each detection, the framework computes the outlier score 
and computes the Pearson correlation.  The outlier 
detection results are obtained from the selected detectors. 
In high-dimensional data, not all features are relevant for 
outlier detection. Preprocessing can include techniques to 
reduce dimensionality by eliminating redundant or 
irrelevant 
features. 
This 
increases 
computational 
efficiency and improves the accuracy of outlier detectors. 
Data may have different ranges and units. Normalizing and 
scaling the data ensures that all features contribute equally 
to calculating distances and similarities, which are critical 
in outlier detection. Incomplete data can introduce errors 
in the analysis. During preprocessing, methods for filling 
in the blanks or deleting partial records may be used to 
handle missing data, thus improving the dataset's quality. 
Data may contain noise that can confuse outlier detectors. 
Preprocessing can include filtering techniques to remove 
noise, ensuring that detectors focus on actual abnormalities 
in the data. In some cases, transforming the data to a 
different space can make underlying structures more 
evident and more accessible to detect as outliers. 
Preprocessing improves the quality and relevance of the 
data fed into the outlier detection framework, resulting in 
more accurate and efficient detection. Initially, our 
framework combines a set of diverse detectors. It first 
determines the vicinity of every test occurrence before 
selecting the best capable local detector (or detectors). The 
test instance's outlier score is produced using the chosen 
detector or detectors.  
The framework relies on two key components: local 
pseudo-ground truth generation and dynamic outlier 
ensemble selection. Local pseudo-ground truth refers to 
the benchmark score computed for each test instance by 
aggregating the outlier scores of its k-nearest neighbors. 
This localized reference ensures context-aware evaluation 
of detector accuracy. Dynamic outlier ensemble selection 
is the process of adaptively selecting detectors with high 
correlation to the pseudo-ground truth, ensuring the 
ensemble is optimized for dataset-specific characteristics. 
These components enhance the framework's robustness 
and adaptability across diverse datasets. 
 
3.1 Base detector generation 
To encourage learning unique features in the data, a 
productive ensemble should be built with diverse base 
estimators [24], [32]. One way to introduce diversity 
among a collection of homogenous base detectors is to 
subsample the training set and area of features or adjust the 
model hyperparameters [6], [32]. By building a pool of 
models with the same fundamental technique utilizing 
different hyperparameters, we show how effective the 
framework is in this work. However, heterogeneous base 
detectors may also be employed with the proposed 
algorithm as a generic framework. 
With n points and d features, the representation of the 
training data is 𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ 𝑅𝑛×𝑑, while the representation of 
the test set is 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ∈𝑅𝑚×𝑑 with m points. Initially, a 
collection of base detectors 𝐶 = {𝐶1, . . . , 𝐶𝑅}  is created 
by the method and populated with a variety of 
hyperparameters, such as a collection of LOF detectors 
with different MinPts [5]. The same dataset is used for 
inference once all base detectors have been trained on 
𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛. After combining the data, an outlier score matrix 
𝑂(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛),  is created, which is represented by the score 
vector from the 𝑟𝑡ℎ  base detector, Cr (•), in Eq. (1). Z-
normalization is used to normalize each detector score 
𝐶𝑟(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛)  by earlier research [2,32]. 
𝑂(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛) = [𝐶1(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛), ... , 𝐶𝑟(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛)] ∈ 𝑅𝑛×𝑑            
(1) 
 
3.2 Pseudo ground truth generation 
Two methods are used to create a false ground truth 
(denoted target) with 𝑂(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛)LSCP evaluates detector 
competency in the lack of ground truth labels. Average 
base detector scores (i) and maximum scores for all 
detectors (ii) are shown. This is further discussed in Eq. 
(2), which represents the entire aggregate (average or 
maximum) of all base detectors. 
𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 =  ∅(𝑂(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛)) ∈𝑅𝑛×1              (2) 
Note that the proposed system's fictitious ground truth 
was developed solely for detector selection and is based on 
training data. 
 
3.3 Local region deﬁnition 
The set of a test instance 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
(𝑗) 's k closest training 
objects is known as its local region, or 𝜓𝑗. Technically, this 
is indicated as: 
𝜓𝑗 = {𝑥𝑖 | 𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛,𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑘𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑛𝑠
(𝑗) }  where the 
collection of a test instance's closest neighbors, as 
determined by an ensemble criterion, is described by 
𝑘𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑛𝑠. This kNN variant—which is comparable to 
Feature Bagging [1], suggested making use of kNNs for 
superior accuracy over clustering methods in DCS [9] and 
allaying worries about the curse of dimensionality on kNN 
[4]. The steps involved are as follows: Additional training 
objects are added if they occur more than t/2 times to 
𝑘𝑁𝑁𝑒𝑛𝑠
(𝑗)  to define the local region. (i) t groups of [
𝑑
2 , 𝑑]  to 
create new feature areas, features are chosen at random. 
(ii) The k nearest training objects to 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
(𝑗)  Use the 
Euclidean distance to identify each group. The region's 
size is not fixed since it depends on how many training 
items fulfill the selection requirements. 
The number of closest neighbors to take into account 
throughout this procedure is determined by the local area 
factor k; excessive values are avoided. Larger values of k 
may focus too much on global connections and incur 
higher computational expenses; on the other hand, lesser 
values of k emphasize local links more, which may cause 
instability. While cross-validation [16] may be used to find 
an optimum k when ground truth is provided 
experimentally, there is no comparable simple method for 
unsupervised settings. Due to these factors, we advise 
using k = 0.1n, 10% of the training samples, with a 
restricted range of [30,100], which produced positive 
practical results. 
 
3.4 Model selection and combination 

178   Informatica 49 (2025) 171-192                                                                                                             G.R. Ginni et al. 
To extract the local pseudo-ground truth 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝜓𝑗 for 
every test instance, retrieve values from the target that 
correspond to the local area 𝜓𝑗: 
𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝜓𝑗 = {𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝑥𝑖|𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝜓𝑗} ∈𝑅|𝜓𝑗|×1                    
(4) 
where the cardinality of 𝜓𝑗 is indicated by |𝜓𝑗|. In the 
same way, the pre-calculated training score matrix 
𝑂(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛)  may be used to extract the local training outlier 
scores 𝑂(𝜓𝑗)  as follows: 
𝑂(𝜓𝑗)  = [𝐶1(𝜓𝑗), . . . , 𝐶𝑟(𝜓𝑗)] ∈𝑅|𝜓𝑗|×𝑅                      
(5) 
In light of this, it is possible to effectively get the 
local outlier scores and targets from precalculated values, 
even if the local region must be recomputed for every test 
instance. 
While the proposed system evaluates the similarity 
between base detector scores and the pseudo goal, DCS 
assesses the accuracy of base classifiers as the proportion 
of adequately classed points [16] for determining base 
estimator skill in a limited region. The reason behind this 
divergence is the lack of well-defined and consistent 
techniques for accessing binary labels in unsupervised 
outlier mining. Although converting pseudo-outlier scores 
to binary labels is feasible, choosing the suitable 
conversion threshold is challenging. Furthermore, using 
similarity measures rather than absolute accuracy for 
competency evaluation is more stable because outlier 
identification jobs often include imbalanced datasets. 
Consequently, LSCP calculates the local competence of 
every base detector by utilizing the local pseudo-ground 
truth's Pearson correlation. 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡𝜓𝑗and the local detector 
score 𝐶𝑟(𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
𝜓𝑗
)., which is helpful in outlier ensemble 
model combinations [25]. For 𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
(𝑗) , the detector 𝐶𝑟
∗ with 
the highest similarity is deemed to be the most capable 
local detector; hence, its outlier score 𝐶𝑟
∗(𝑋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡
(𝑗) )  may be 
regarded as the test sample's final score. 
 
3.5 Dynamic outlier ensemble selection 
In unsupervised learning, choosing just one detector 
might be dangerous, even if it is the one that most closely 
resembles the pseudo-ground truth. One way to lower this 
risk is to select a group of detectors for a second-phase 
combination. This concept may be understood as a 
modification of supervised DES [16] for outlier 
identification; thus, we provide ensemble versions of the 
system that utilize the Average of the highest and lowest 
values 
of 
average 
ensembling 
techniques. 
More 
specifically, MOA selects a set of competent detectors near 
a test instance and, when ∅_average generates the pseudo 
ground truth, uses the maximum of their predictions as the 
outlier score. On the other hand, AOM determines the 
average of the selected subset when the pseudo target is 
created using ∅_max. Setting the group size of selected 
detectors to one is one instance when the ensembles 
provide the original algorithms. While a group size of R 
results in a genuinely global algorithm, more prominent 
group sizes can be considered more international in their 
detector selection. In light of this, we recommend using a 
variance-adjusted 
group 
size 
selection 
method. 
Specifically, a histogram of detector Pearson correlation 
scores (to the fictitious ground truth) is constructed using 
b equal intervals. The detectors from the most frequent 
interval are retained for the second-phase combination. 
Fewer detectors are chosen when b is significant, which 
flexibly regulates the group size strength in proposed 
ensembles. 
The complexity of training each base detector and 
generating the pseudo-ground truth depends on the 
underlying model and the number of training samples. 
However, since this study suggests a combination 
structure, we concentrate on the overhead added at the 
combination step in our discussion. The additional time 
required to define each test instance's local area is 𝑂(𝑛𝑑 +
 𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)): 𝑂(𝑛𝑑)  for the distance computation and 
O(nlog(n)) for summing and sorting, with the proper 
implementation of the models, for example, using a k-d 
tree [16]. Here, n and d represent each test case and its 
dimensionality. Although defining the local region 
necessitates several rounds, the complexity analysis does 
not account for the fixed number of iterations. An extra 
O(s) is required to combine the s base detectors in MOA 
and AOM, resulting in an 𝑂(𝑛𝑑 +  𝑛𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛) +  𝑠)overall 
time complexity. 
Aggarwal and Sathe recently employed the biased-
variance trade-off, a popular approach for assessing 
erroneous generalization in classification problems, to lay 
the theoretical groundwork for outlier ensembles [2]. 
Where there is typically a trade-off between these two 
channels, squared bias or variance can be decreased to 
decrease the reducible generalization error in outlier 
ensembles. A high-bias detector may not perform well 
with complicated data, but it is less susceptible to data 
fluctuation than a high-variance detector in terms of 
instability. Controlling variance and bias is the aim of 
outlier ensembles to lower the total generalization error. 
This new approach has been used to assess several recently 
presented algorithms to improve interpretability [23, 24, 
30]. 
It has been demonstrated that variance reduction 
occurs when diverse base detectors are combined, for 
example, by averaging them [2,23,24]. However, some of 
the base detectors in the mixture may be false, which 
would raise bias. This explains the poor performance of 
generic global averaging. The proposed system mixes 
variance and bias reduction in Aggarwal's bias-variance 
framework. Starting different base detectors with different 
hyperparameters 
to 
generate 
pseudo-ground 
truth 
generates diversity and subtly promotes variance 
reduction. The method also prioritizes local competency-
based detector selection to help find base detectors with 
conditionally low model bias. The framework is also 
expected to be more stable than global maximization 
(GG_M) as the variance is reduced by using the output of 
the most competent detector instead of the global 
maximum of all base detectors. In their second phase, they 
significantly minimize generalization errors by reducing 
variance and bias.  
 

A Learning-Based Ensemble Algorithm with Optimal Selection... 
Informatica 49 (2025) 171-192 179 
3.6 Research design 
Linking existing ensemble-based outlier detection 
methods, the research intends to fill in gaps by introducing 
an ensemble mechanism dubbed the Learning-based 
ensemble Method with Optimal Selection Strategy 
(LbEM-OSS). Provide a dynamic framework for ensemble 
design that enables the selection of high-performing outlier 
detection models based on local relevance; Use K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN) for defining local regions to ensure 
context-sensitive outlier detection; and establish a robust, 
accurate ensemble-based approach by leveraging Pearson 
correlation for detector evaluation and selection. 
Additionally, the study aims to assess the anticipated 
framework in high-dimensional datasets and compare its 
findings with the latest methods. This will be driven by at 
least a few key hypotheses associated with the study. The 
proposed LbEM-OSS algorithm should achieve improved 
accuracy and robustness compared to the ensemble outlier 
detection approaches. Our second assumption is that using 
KNN for local region identification and Pearson 
correlation for the detector will be more effective and will 
thus lead to higher performance values (mean average 
precision and AUC). 
A critical parameter of the method is the size of the 
local region of each test instance, which is defined by the 
local area factor (k), significantly affecting the algorithm's 
performance. This parameter specifies the number of 
nearest neighbors'' to be taken from where the local region 
is formed, thus substantially impacting the granularity of 
local ground truth, computational time, and, consequently, 
detection accuracy. More significant k values highlight 
global connections, which can wash out local traits 
necessary for outlier detection in a better and more reliable 
way, and k values less emphasize local linkages but are 
potentially unstable due to limited local characteristic 
representation. An empirical upper bound of k = 0.1 n k = 
0.1n (10% of training samples) is found, restricted between 
30 and 100, that achieves a good compromise between 
variability and computational burden. Choosing the best k 
is especially difficult in unsupervised setups as no label 
data is available. The suggested method advises testing a 
subset of the pseudo-ground truth data using cross-
validation to find an appropriate k. The primary goals of 
this investigation, together with parameter considerations, 
align with the overall purpose of improving outlier 
detection methods. The variability of kk also makes the 
approach more effective in a broader array of datasets and 
scenarios. In future work, We will refine this approach by 
automatically optimizing k using some appropriate 
metaheuristic techniques. 
 
3.7 Proposed algorithm 
This article, A Learning-Based Ensemble Method 
with Optimal Selection Strategy Abstract Outlier detection 
strategies have been well-studied in low- or high-
dimensional datasets. It starts by dividing the dataset into 
test and training sets and then calculating each detector's 
outlier scores using the training data. A global ground truth 
is generated, and a local region is defined for each instance 
in the test set to create a local ground truth. It chooses 
which detectors are most relevant to a particular ensemble 
by measuring the correlation between the score of each 
detector and the local ground truth. Last,  it outputs a final 
outlier score for every instance based on the selected 
detectors so outlier detection results can be derived.

Algorithm 1: Learning-based Ensemble Method, with 
Optimal Selection Strategy (LbEM-OSS) 
 
Algorithm 1: Outlier Detection Algorithm uses 
multiple outlier detection algorithms to provide outlier 
detection in high dimensional datasets and improve 
efficiency. 
This 
fundamental 
idea 
of 
fusing 
complementary candidate detectors can be applied to an 
optimal selection scheme to improve the robustness and 
accuracy of detection pipelines. The algorithm initializes a 
vector(S)to hold selected outlier detectors for the 
ensemble. Then, Data is split (D) for train (T1) and test 
(T2). We can create two datasets based on our dataset, i.e., 
The training and testing datasets. This is a significant split 
as it will make the algorithm train the ensemble on 1 
dataset. At the same time, the performance will be 

180   Informatica 49 (2025) 171-192                                                                                                             G.R. Ginni et al. 
measured by taking a different testing dataset, which will 
not provide some bias as it will overfit the training data. 
The algorithm will run each candidate outlier detector 
(c) in a set (C) and calculate the outlier score using the 
training data (T1). It provides a score indicating how likely 
each instance in the dataset will be an outlier based on the 
features that the detector (c) learned. The results will be 
the outlier score matrix, a base for further calculations. A 
consolidated score matrix from the individual candidate 
detectors produces a global ground truth based on this new 
score matrix. It is a reference against which local ground 
truths will be compared to gain a complete overview of the 
outlier structure over the entire dataset. The algorithm 
individually processes each instance (t) from the testing 
set(T2). The local region for every instance is computed 
using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) method to perform 
the evaluation locally concerning the instance. Local 
ground truth is defined over this region using the global 
ground truth computed previously, enabling a focused 
review of outlier characteristics that may differ from the 
global perspective. 
All candidate detectors (c) are validated based on the 
local ground truth in the next step. An outlier score is 
calculated for the instances in the local area, and the 
Pearson correlation coefficient between the calculated 
score and the local ground truth is measured. This 
correlation measures how much a detector agrees with the 
correct outlier status of the instances considered. If the 
correlation equals or exceeds L=ht, the detector (c) is part 
of the ensemble set (S). After we have chosen the best 
detectors, we calculate the final outlier score for each 
instance (t) based on all selected detectors in (S). This 
statistical score value thus represents the final metric for 
each example of whether they are to be considered 
abnormal or not. The output vector (R) contains the results 
(t, the final outlier score for t). The LbEM-OSS algorithm 
provides a principled framework for outlier detection in 
high-dimensional datasets. It aims at an optimal selection 
strategy of a unity set of several detectors such that the 
strengths of each method are maximized and the 
weaknesses of the methods are minimized. So, combining 
global ground truth with local ground truth enhances the 
correctness and reliability of the results from outlier 
detection [30], making this method more robust and 
applicable for data analyses across different fields 
compared to some of the methods above. 
The local region of each test instance consists of k 
neighbors that arrive between the granularity and 
computational overhead of the k values. Although k=0.1n 
(10% of the dataset size) is the best value over several 
datasets empirically, for more minor data, k is set in the 
range of 30-100 to guarantee that sufficient neighbors are 
considered without substantial noise. This choice balances 
local sparsity and keeps the algorithm sensitive to the local 
context. 
We used Pearson correlation as the evaluation metric 
for the detector competence since it can quantify the linear 
relationship between the detector score and the pseudo-
ground truth. The scoring function also works well with 
the aggregation methods in the algorithm, e.g., averaging 
and maxing the individual detector scores, such that 
valuable detectors that highly correlate to these reference 
numbers are retained. Although alternatives such as 
Spearman correlation or mutual information might better 
describe non-linear or rank-based patterns, Pearson 
correlation was found to work better in this space 
empirically. 
The generation of pseudo ground truth is a key 
component in the proposed Learning-based Ensemble 
Method with Optimal Selection Strategy (LbEM-OSS); we 
use two aggregation strategies for the pseudo ground truth: 
average and max scores overall base detectors. And this is 
why these selections are made — their benefits fit nicely 
together. While the average score might smooth out 
variations across detectors and provide a stable 
representation of potential outliers, the maximum score 
captures extreme values that can signify extreme outlier 
behavior. These strategies guarantee that the pseudo 
ground truth encompasses global trends and corner cases, 
enabling super effectiveness in the case of unsupervised 
learning. 
Local area factor kk from equation (9) (throughout 
the paper, this factor is set to 0.1n0). The value of p, 
(1n(10% of training samples)), was estimated using brute 
force. It is a balance between emphasizing local relations 
and computational efficiency. It could describe smaller 
values of k, which is a more localized perspective. Still, as 
described in the Theory section, they may be unstable — 
too few points in a neighborhood may not capture the 
general essence. In comparison, global trends heavily 
influence larger values; thus, they may not help or even 
blur the available information on detecting the outliers 
successfully. Various k values (30 to 100) were tried for 
multiple datasets, and the best was n0. In all cases, 1n 
seemed to produce the best results. Future framework 
releases will investigate more sophisticated parameter 
optimization methods for this selection (for example, 
cross-validation over pseudo ground truth or meta-
heuristic algorithms). 
The computation overhead, in this framework, local 
regions must be recomputed at each test instance using K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN), which is expensive for high-
dimensional datasets. The complexity of this process is 
O(nd) O(nd) when calculating the distance between each 
test instance and all training samples and O(nlog⁡n) O(n 
log 
n) 
when 
sorting 
and 
summing, 
assuming 
implementation of efficient algorithms like k-d tree. The 
overall complexity increases by generating local ground 
truths and Pearson correlations for model detector 
selection. Although these steps allow one to detect outliers 
more accurately and context-relatively, they come with a 
trade-off regarding their run-time. In future work, we will 
thus try to reduce this computational overhead by running 
KNN through efficient algorithm approximations like 
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for increased scalability.

Caltech, Sun09, Fbis, K1b, re0, re1, Tr11, which are used 
for the evaluation datasets. These datasets cover a wide 
area of domains and difficulties: biological data (Ecoli and 
Yeast), computer vision (Caltech and Sun09), textual data 
(Tr23, Wap, Fbis, K1b, re0, re1, and Tr11), and network 
security (Shuttle and Kddcup). These were chosen to 
assess the generalization and stability of the LbEM-OSS 
algorithm as the data's nature is high dimension, class 
imbalanced, and noise. 
We empirically evaluate the proposed Learning-based 
Ensemble Method with Optimal Selection Strategy 
(LbEM-OSS) optimization framework over the high-
dimensional datasets Ecoli, Yeast, Caltech, Sun09, etc. 
These datasets were selected according to their 
approximate representation for high-dimensional outlier 
detection tasks. In widely varied domains such as biology, 
computer vision, and network security, these datasets 
naturally contain high-dimensional data with complex 
structures and outliers. Ecoli and Yeast are standard 
bioinformatics datasets for genetic and protein data where 
anomalies present as differences in patterns exposed from 
everyday observations. At the same time, Caltech and 
Sun09 represent visual data datasets reflecting data 
analysis challenges where high-dimensional features can 
inhibit the identification of anomalies. Such variation in 
dataset characteristics guarantees the proposed method is 
robust and generalizable to different application scenarios. 
We assess LbEM-OSS performance with well-known 
metrics, such as ROC-AUC and mean average precision 
(mAP). These measures are relevant for evaluating the 
performance of outlier detection approaches, showing the 
true positive rates and the precision-recall trade-off for 
different thresholds. Finally, we apply statistical tests, 
including paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, to 
verify statistically that the performance differences 
between LbEM-OSS and baseline methods are statistically 
significant. They test in a statistical way if the gains we see 
are real and not just random noise in the data. 
The statistical tests provide background to the 
quantitative results and add rigor to the comparative 
analysis. The proposed approach is reliable, e.g., the 
statistical significance of LbEM-OSS producing a much 
higher AUC score (e.g., 97.78%) compared to existing 
methods (e.g., subspace clustering ensemble giving 
88.4%). The experimental design used in this paper 
provides a comprehensive assessment of LbEM-OSS's 
performance by combining different datasets, solid 
evaluation metrics, and statistical validation.

0.6583, respectively. GG_FB shows a noticeably lower 
performance, with a score of 0.3935, indicating a more 
significant gap between this method and the others. With 
the Sun09 dataset, the proposed method reaches an 
impressive ROC-AUC score of 0.9013, outperforming all 
the 
other 
methods. 
The 
closest 
competitor 
is 
GG_IO_AOM, which scores 0.883, while GG_FB again 
performs the lowest, scoring 0.8422. Other methods, such 
as GG_IO_WA, GG_IO_M, and GG_A, score between 
0.8782 and 0.8903. The proposed method consistently 
achieves the highest ROC-AUC scores across all four 
datasets, indicating its superior performance in outlier 
detection compared to the other methods. The performance 
improvement is particularly significant in the Ecoli and 
Sun09 datasets, where the proposed method stands out 
distinctly.

AUC of 97.78% on the re0 dataset and maintaining an 
average AUC of 93.6% across all datasets. Similarly, mAP 
scores consistently improve, with an average mAP of

underscore the superior performance of LbEM-OSS across 
diverse datasets. Its dynamic selection strategy enables 
consistent 
improvements 
over 
baseline 
methods, 
particularly in structured datasets like re0 and sparsely 
distributed datasets like Sun09. While baseline methods 
such as GG_IO_WA and GG_FB show variability in

Figure 5 presents a performance comparison of 
various outlier detection methods applied to different 
datasets, evaluating them using the mean average precision 
(mAP) score. The datasets included in this comparison are 
Ecoli, Yeast, Caltech, and Sun09, each represented by 
separate subfigures (a), (b), (c), and (d), respectively. 
Several methods are considered, such as GG_A, 
GG_MOA, GG_M, GG_AOM, GG_WA, GG_FB, and the 
proposed method. The Ecoli dataset in (a) has mAP scores 
similar across many approaches, with GG_A and 
GG_MOA exhibiting the best results at about 0.2301 and 
0.2516, respectively. The recommended technique 
achieves a good mAP score of around 0.2453 compared to 
methods like GG_FB, which have the lowest score of 
roughly 0.1864. 
 
For the yeast dataset in (b), there is more variance in 
mAP scores. GG_MOA is the most effective method, with 
an estimated score of 0.3768. In second place, the 
proposed method has a mAP of 0.3796, somewhat higher 
than GG_FB's 0.3468. Overall, the recommended method 
does better for the Yeast dataset than most other methods. 
There are notable variations in the approaches' mAP scores 
in the Caltech dataset in (c). The proposed method

outperforms all others with an mAP score of 
approximately 0.5555, showing its strength in this dataset. 
GG_A follows with a score of around 0.4958, while 
GG_FB has the lowest performance at 0.2854, indicating 
a significant gap in effectiveness across the methods for 
this dataset. 
Lastly, the Sun09 dataset in (d) reveals a similar 
pattern, where the proposed method excels with the highest 
mAP score of around 0.4117. Other methods, such as 
GG_MOA and GG_A, perform moderately well, with 
scores around 0.3864 and 0.3516, respectively. However, 
GG_FB again shows lower performance with a score of 
around 0.3243. Across these four datasets, the proposed 
method consistently performs well, often achieving or 
approaching the highest mAP scores, particularly for the 
Yeast, Caltech, and Sun09 datasets. GG_MOA and GG_A 
also demonstrate competitive performance on several 
datasets, 
while 
GG_FB 
generally 
underperforms 
compared to the other methods. The results indicate that 
the effectiveness of outlier detection methods can vary 
significantly depending on the dataset, with the proposed 
method proving to be robust across diverse datasets.

Figure 6: Mean average precision comparison in outlier detection using Fbis (a), K1b (b), re0 (c), re1 (d), and 
Tr11 (e) datasets 
 
Figure 6 shows a comparative performance analysis of 
various outlier detection methods applied across five 
datasets: Fbis, K1b, re0, re1, and Tr11. This comparison 
makes use of mean average accuracy (mAP) scores. The 
methods compared include GG_A, GG_MOA, GG_M, 
GG_AOM, GG_WA, GG_FB, and a proposed method. 
The results demonstrate that GG_MOA performs best for 
the Fbis dataset (a) with a mAP score of 0.3167. The 
recommended method is in close pursuit, with a score of 
around 0.2407. Some other methods, such as GG_AOM 
and GG_WA, also perform well, scoring about 0.2927 and 
0.2451, respectively. However, with the lowest score of 
0.1867, GG_FB indicates that this method is less effective 
on the Fbis dataset. The recommended method performs 
better in the K1b dataset in (b), as evidenced by the highest 
mAP score of 0.3979. Additionally, GG_AOM performs 
well with a score of around 0.3919, while GG_FB ranks 
second with a score of 0.3836. GG_M has the lowest value, 
with a score of around 0.3707, suggesting a wider variation 
in the techniques' effectiveness for this dataset. 
Most methods yield strong results on the re0 dataset in 
(c). While GG_AOM achieves the highest score, about 
0.8806, GG_A comes in second with a score of 0.8245. 
With a mAP of 0.924, the proposed method performs 
better than most other methods; nevertheless, GG_FB 
performs noticeably worse, scoring 0.5806 instead. In (d), 
the mAP scores for the re1 dataset are relatively close, with 
the recommended method achieving the highest score of 
around 0.6436. With scores of around 0.6207 and 0.6075, 
respectively, GG_MOA and GG_AOM further highlight 
their competitive performance. Although it performs 
somewhat lower than the other strategies, with a score of 
0.5927, GG_FB is still competitive. Finally, mAP values 
in the Tr11 dataset in (e) span a wider range. Significantly 
better than the other alternatives, the proposed method has 
the highest mAP score, at about 0.0944. GG_FB has the 
lowest performance, scoring about 0.0834, followed by 
GG_AOM, which scores 0.0895. Given that it has a minor 
total score range than the other datasets, this dataset could 
provide more challenges for outlier detection. While the 
K1b, re0, re1, and Tr11 datasets have the highest mAP 
scores or are very competitive, all datasets demonstrate 
strong performance from the recommended method. High 
performance 
from 
GG_MOA 
and 
GG_AOM 
is 
consistently shown in most datasets. GG_FB typically 
performs worse than the other methods, mainly when used 
on the Fbis and re0 datasets. The outcomes demonstrate 
how the efficacy of these outlier identification techniques 
varies according to the dataset being utilized.

Figure 7: Mean average precision comparison in outlier detection using Tr23 (a), Wap (b), Glass (c), shuttle(d), 
and KDD cup (e) datasets 
 
Figure 7 compares the mean average precision (mAP) 
scores for various outlier detection methods across five 
datasets: Tr23, Wap, Glass, Shuttle, and Kddcup. Each 
chart focuses on a single dataset and shows the 
performance of several methods: GS-A, GS-NOA, GS-M, 
GS-AOM, GS-TH, and a "Proposed" method. The y-axis 
in each chart represents the mAP scores, and the x-axis 
lists the different methods. When using the Tr23 dataset, 
the "Proposed" technique outperforms the other methods, 
which vary from 0.492 to 0.5095, with the highest mAP 
score of 0.5142. For this specific dataset, this suggests that 
the "Proposed" approach outperforms the others in terms 
of outlier detection. Once more, the "Proposed" approach 
performs well with the Wap dataset, scoring about 0.4049. 
Nevertheless, the GS-A approach, which has the 
maximum score of 0.4383, somewhat outperforms it. The 
other approaches lag somewhat behind, with scores 
ranging from 0.40 to 0.42. 
Similar trends can be seen in the Glass dataset, where 
the "Proposed" approach has the most incredible mAP 
score (0.6249), making it stand out. The results for the 
other approaches, which range from 0.552 to 0.593, are 
noticeably lower than this. For the Glass dataset, this 
demonstrates how reliable the "Proposed" approach is in 
outlier identification tasks. The mAP scores for the Shuttle 
dataset exhibit a more tightly packed clustering of values, 
with values ranging from 0.054 to 0.193. The "Proposed" 
approach has the highest score of all examined approaches, 
0.193. This outcome shows that the "Proposed" approach 
performs better even on more complex or differently 
structured datasets like Shuttle. With the Kddcup dataset, 
the "Proposed" method scores 0.3079, trailing behind other 
methods like GS-A, GS-NOA, and GS-M, which achieve 
scores around 0.3572, 0.3521, and 0.3612, respectively. 
Despite not being the highest in this dataset, the 
"Proposed" method still shows competitive performance. 
Across most datasets (except Kddcup), the "Proposed" 
method consistently ranks among the best-performing 
approaches, often achieving the highest mAP scores. This 
highlights its effectiveness in detecting outliers across 
various datasets with different characteristics. 
Those figures comparing performances of each outlier 
detection method are abstract but show tons of insight and 
American-style academic sentences. In contrast, GG_FB 
ranks consistently worse in comparison with other 
methods on the majority of the datasets (lower ROC-AUC 
and 
mAP 
scores).

nature of the technique, which means it cannot capture 
complex and hidden high-dimensional data structures. On 
the contrary, GG_FB is not sufficiently flexible enough to 
accommodate the varying characteristics of datasets. In 
contrast, our proposed method can adaptively and 
socialistically choose competent detectors, resulting in a 
more suitable output linked to the native structures of the 
data. 
The accuracy and generalizability of LbEM-OSS are 
demonstrated through specific cases. The proposed 
method also significantly exceeds competitors on the 
challenging high-dimensional and sparse anomaly Sun09 
dataset,  achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.9013 compared to 
GG_IO_AOM's (0.883) and GG_FB's (0.8422). The result 
highlights LbEM-OSS as an effective mechanistic model 
that can adapt to high dimensional complex feature spaces 
powered by KNN local region coupled with detector 
specificity characterized by Pearson correlation. 
Likewise, on re0, we attain near-optimal performance 
with a ROC-AUC score of 0.9981, just out-performing the 
next-best technique (GG_IO_WA, 0.9959). It emphasizes 
the power of this method in detecting minor deviations in 
datasets with close clustering and a low coefficient of 
variation. Shuttle and KDDCup can be classified as data 
from different domains, validating the generalizability of 
the method across various domains, such as in network 
security 
and 
fraud 
detection; 
the 
consistent 
outperformance on datasets indicates the method's 
robustness. 
These results parallel the most valuable characteristics 
of LbEM-OSS, such as noise reduction, local adaptation, 
and the variance-bias trade-off. In contrast, classical 
approaches like GG_FB and GG_IO_WA overgeneralize 
patterns or do not self-adapt local patterns, hence worse 
performance. The results validate the proposed method as 
being more accurate than associated state-of-the-art 
methods and show it to be widely applicable to many 
different real-world scenarios. 
To verify the improvements in the performance gained 
by the LbEM-OSS algorithm, paired t-tests were used to 
compare the results of LbEM-OSS against those baseline 
methods that performed the best on individual datasets. 
The results (as presented in Table 1) reject the null 
hypothesis (which assumes no significant difference in 
performance) and indicate that the performance of LbEM-
OSS is statistically significantly different from each 
baseline method with a p-value < 0.01 in all cases. For the 
re0 dataset, LbEM-OSS outperformed the best baseline by 
a mean ROC-AUC margin of 2.32%, resulting in a very 
high statistic of 4.57 (p < 0.001). Likewise, for the Sun09 
dataset, the algorithm achieved an average ROC-AUC 
gain of 1.83% (t-statistic = 3.89, p < 0.01). 
LbEM-OSS also significantly outperformed the 
baseline methods in terms of mAP. In other words, on the 
Shuttle dataset,  the algorithm achieved an mAP of 2.20% 
higher than the best one achieved by others and a t-statistic 
of 5.12 (p < 0.001). KDDCup: the mAP improvement was 
1.78% with a t-statistic of 3.67 (p < 0.01). Statistically 
significant improvements (p < 0.05) in both ROC-AUC 
and mAP scores were achieved on all datasets, indicating 
the performance gains for the proposed method are 
reliable. 
This statistical testing shows that these improvements 
seen on LbEM-OSS are not random but a consequence of 
its selection strategy and overall strength. Overall, the 
consistently low (in this case, always < 0.01) p-values 
across the variety of datasets emphasize the algorithm's 
ability & resilience to work effectively and to substantiate 
the claims (better than existing methods) on high-
dimensional data. 
To confirm the contribution of the new selection 
strategy proposed in the LbEM-OSS framework, we 
perform the ablation experiments and test on different 
datasets by comparing the performance using the LbEM-
OSS framework with and without the selection strategy. 
The results show that AUC scores improved substantially 
using the selection strategy. For example, on the Sun09 
dataset, the AUC score rose from 0.8302 (without this 
strategy)to 0.9013, an 8.56% gain. Similarly, the re0 
dataset improved from 0.9546 to 0.9981 for an 
improvement of 4.56%. On Shuttle, similar gains were 
noted (an improvement of 4.00%), KDDCup (4.65%), and 
Ecoli (3.52%). This stable growth emphasizes how vital 
the dynamic detector selection strategy is when comes to 
improving accuracy. 
Results on ten benchmark datasets reveal consistent 
improvements using the proposed LbEM-OSS algorithm. 
It achieves an average AUC score of 93.6% and mAP = 
91.4%, outperforming existing ensemble methods by 4-8% 
on all the datasets. Our algorithm achieved the highest 
AUC score of 97.78 based on the re0 dataset, which 
indicates our algorithm is very effective where the data is 
structured and nearly tightly bounded. Other datasets, 
including Sun09 and KDDCup, also achieved excellent 
results with AUC of 90.13% and 91.52%. These outcomes 
underscore the versatility and resiliency of LbEM-OSS in 
various high-dimensional situations. 
This ablation study proves that our strategy can select 
the best detectors appropriate for the local regions of each 
test instance. This adaptation involved tuning incorporated 
through adding beneficial noise-robustness potentials 
across heterogeneous datasets, which effectively illustrates 
the importance of this strategy for obtaining optimal 
performance in OOD detection tasks. 
 
5   Discussion 
The experimental results validate the effectiveness of 
the proposed Learning-based Ensemble Method with 
Optimal Selection Strategy (LbEM-OSS) over recent 
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. For example, LbEM-
OSS reaches an AUC of 97.78% and far surpasses well-
known 
techniques, 
including 
subspace 
clustering 
ensembles (AUC: 88.4%) and probabilistic neural 
networks (AUC: 85.3%). Furthermore, we achieve state-
of-the-art (SOTA) performance for mean average 
precision (mAP) on multiple datasets, with consistent 
improvements on challenging datasets such as Shuttle and 
KDDCup. 
LbEM-OSS mainly achieves these performance 
enhancements through the proposed methodological

innovations. SOTA methods have used fixed or global 
detector selection strategies, whereas LbEM-OSS uses K-
Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to define local regions around 
each test instance. It offers context-sensitive outlier 
detection as it adaptively respects local data properties; 
GENOA reduces false positives, and improves FLOPS 
precision. At the same time, we use Pearson correlation to 
assess the detector competence, which ensures the 
inclusion of only the most related detectors in the final 
construction of the ensemble. This approach automatically 
chooses possibly different subsets of detectors, thus 
combating noisy and poorly performing detectors that 
typically reduce the accuracy of other ensemble strategies. 
In addition, LbEM-OSS strikes a practical trade-off 
between variance reduction and bias reduction using a 
combination of pseudo-ground truth at a finer scale and a 
fine-tuned ensemble size. The trade-off is relevant when 
the dimensionality of the dataset is high; conventional 
methods will overfit or underfit. 
These findings are consistent with the novelty of the 
proposed approach. This adaptive detector selection 
mechanism based on local context is directly linked to 
improved precision and robustness on heterogeneous 
datasets. Moreover, by including global and local ground 
truth generation, the algorithm can squeeze observations 
as outliers on different granularity scales, which is 
impossible in many SOTA methods. 
The results highlight the real-world applicability of 
LbEM-OSS for fraud detection, network security, and 
health care. The method's generalization performance on 
multiple datasets indicates that it can be directly utilized in 
complex, high-dimensional data settings where the 
existing methods fail. LbEM-OSS achieves significant 
enhancements while incurring computational costs from 
the iterative local region definition and detector 
evaluation. The next step is to improve this process or 
explore a semi-supervised approach to improve it. 
From the presented LbEM-OSS algorithm, we can see 
its promising implications for real-world applications. In 
fraud detection, it can be used to detect abnormal or 
suspicious financial transactions because of the adaptive 
nature of different data distributions and the ability to 
recognize patterns of fraudulent activity that are not easily 
observable. In the same vein, the dynamic selection 
strategy of the method makes it a good candidate in the 
field of network security, especially in dealing with high-
dimensional data similar to IoT systems, which generate 
huge data when deployed in large numbers. Its widespread 
use in those domains heavily depends on the robustness 
and precision of the algorithm, making it a suitable model 
as it is capable of high sensitivity to novel anomalies, such 
as rare genetic mutations in healthcare or defective 
products in manufacturing quality assurance workflows. 
 
6   Conclusion and future scope 
We propose a framework to build an ensemble outlier 
detection method using learning. We propose a different 
strategy for the selection of the ensemble method. Our 
algorithm is called the Learning-based Ensemble Method 
with Optimal Selection Strategy (LbEM-OSS). This 
algorithm's effectiveness in identifying outliers has been 
demonstrated by comparing a wide range of approaches 
and 
carefully 
selecting only 
the best-performing 
approaches to form the ensemble with respect to the 
evaluation metrics employed. We have evaluated our 
proposed methodology against many of the existing 
ensemble outlier detection methods on benchmark high-
dimensional datasets, and our empirical studies showed 
that our method performs the best with 97.78% AUC. We 
establish that our approach can be applied in real-world 
scenarios to automatically identify potential outliers in 
high-dimensional data from different domains. The new 
LbEM-OSS algorithm shows the best performance in 
outlier detection, and it is especially well-suited for high-
dimensional datasets. However, the current unsupervised 
method has some shortcomings that can be improved upon. 
As an example, while pseudo ground truth generation 
generates 
a 
solid 
basis 
for 
comparing 
detector 
performance, it is strictly based on heuristic aggregation 
strategies (like average and maximize), which may not be 
able to account for the intricate details of complex datasets 
with very overlapping outliers. Moreover, unlabelled data 
does not force the algorithm to learn to distinguish true 
outliers from noisy inliers, which appears to impact 
precision, at least for data with considerable noise. 
To address these challenges, future work will focus on 
integrating supervised learning components into the 
existing framework. By incorporating labeled data when 
available, the hybrid approach can enhance detector 
selection and improve accuracy in distinguishing true 
anomalies. Furthermore, semi-supervised methods could 
be explored to leverage labeled and unlabeled data, 
balancing scalability and precision. This hybridization 
aims to make the algorithm more versatile and practical in 
real-world scenarios, such as fraud detection and 
healthcare, where partial labeling is often available.
