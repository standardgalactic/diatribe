Nonreciprocal interactions in many-body systems lead to time-dependent states, commonly ob-
served in biological, chemical, and ecological systems. The stability of these states in the thermo-
dynamic limit and the critical behavior of the phase transition from static to time-dependent states
are not yet fully understood. To address these questions, we study a minimalistic system endowed
with nonreciprocal interactions: an Ising model with two spin species having opposing goals. The
mean-field equation predicts three stable phases: disorder, static order, and a time-dependent swap
phase. Large scale numerical simulations support the following: (i) in 2D, the swap phase is desta-
bilized by defects; (ii) in 3D, the swap phase is stable, and has the properties of a time crystal;
(iii) the transition from disorder to swap in 3D is characterized by the critical exponents of the 3D
XY model, and corresponds to the breaking of a continuous symmetry, time translation invariance;
(iv) when the two species have fully anti-symmetric couplings, the static-order phase is unstable
in any finite dimension due to droplet growth; (v) in the general case of asymmetric couplings,
static order can be restored by a droplet-capture mechanism preventing the droplets from growing
indefinitely. We provide details on the full phase diagram which includes first- and second-order-like
phase transitions and study how the system coarsens into swap and static-order states.

INTRODUCTION
Many-body systems with nonreciprocal interactions
emerge in contexts ranging from neuroscience [1-3] and
social networks [4-6] to ecology [7-10] and open quantum
systems [11-13].
These systems exhibit rich collective
behavior including time-dependent states that can arise
because the dynamics does not follow from the minimiza-
tion of a single potential function [14-21]. However, it re-
mains unknown whether these time-dependent states can
be thought of as proper non-equilibrium phases of matter,
in the sense of the term used in statistical physics; and
if so, whether they exhibit well-defined phase transitions
and critical behavior. In particular, we are interested in
the fate of these time-dependent states in systems made
of locally coupled units subject to thermal noise in finite
spatial dimensions when they are taken to the thermo-
dynamic limit.
In order to address this question, we consider a nonre-
ciprocal version of the Ising model, in which two species
of spins have incompatible goals: spins of species A tend
to align with spins of species B, while spins B tend to
anti-align with spins A. This leads to a cyclic dynamics
where spins of each species tend to flip in turn. We study
this system through analytical arguments and extensive
Monte-Carlo simulations. A short account of our results
is presented in Letter form in Ref. [22]; we summarize
here the most salient points.
First, numerical simula-
tions indicate that in our model, a time-dependent phase
with long-range spatial and temporal order indeed exists
in three spatial dimensions. In this phase, the magneti-
zation oscillates for arbitrarily long times. The system
acts as a perfect clock in the thermodynamic limit, in
the sense that the coherence time of the oscillations di-
verges with the size of the system. Second, a continu-
ous phase transition between this oscillatory phase and
a disordered (i.e. paramagnetic) phase, corresponding to
a Hopf bifurcation in mean-field, is observed. Numerical
evidence shows that it is associated with scale invari-
ance, and the corresponding static critical exponents are
compatible with the 3D XY universality class.
Third,
we found that a static ordered phase (similar to a fer-
romagnetic phase) can exist when nonreciprocal interac-
tions are present, but only if there is some symmetric
coupling between the species. However, we found no evi-
dence of a direct transition between the oscillatory phase
and the static-order phase, in contrast with mean-field
predictions.

BACKGROUND
The following section provides background and con-
text on different aspects related to our work, as well as
relations to existing literature. It can be skipped on first
reading.
A.
Nonreciprocal interactions between groups
There is a rich literature on nonequilibrium lattice
models, including variants of the Ising model with asym-
metric couplings exhibiting a variety of complex phenom-
ena [23-27]. A distinguishing feature of the nonrecipro-
cal Ising model introduced in this paper is the presence
of macroscopic nonreciprocal interactions between two
groups of spins of comparable sizes.
This is a rather
generic feature that arises in a variety of physical con-
texts, some of which can be captured by Ising or Ising-like
minimal models. Examples include:

• Nonlinear parametric resonators, that can be mapped
to Ising spins. Networks of coupled parametric oscillators
have been used as platforms to realize (reciprocal) "Ising
machines" that solve combinatorial optimization prob-
lems [28-34]. This is essentially because a single of these
resonators implements a double-well potential, and a lin-
ear coupling effectively produces a (reciprocal) Ising-like
coupling. Reference [35] shows experimentally and ana-
lytically that driven non-identical parametric resonators
can be mapped into nonreciprocally coupled Ising spins.
A network of such resonators could directly realize the
nonreciprocal Ising model discussed in the present work,
as well as implement models of learning with nonrecipro-
cal couplings between the artifical neurons [2, 3, 36-40].
• Models of collective opinion dynamics, such as in the
voter model [23, 41], where the values of the spins repre-
sent different opinions. Different communities may have
asymmetric interactions: for instance, this is the case
of conformists and contrarians (or alternatively trend-
setters) [41-49]. Similarly, spin models have been used
to model game theory and decision making of economic
agents [6].
• Models of the collective response of transmembrane re-
ceptors, that have been put forward for the high sensitiv-
ity of cells to external chemicals in chemotaxis [50-54].
It has been argued that nonreciprocal couplings between
the receptors and the kinases that serve as an output
signal is required to account for experimental observa-
tions [55-57].
• Models of neurons based on networks of spins, such
as the Hopfield model [58, 59], can contain asymmetric
interactions [1-3, 36, 60-63], that account not only for
existence of asymmetric neural connections but also for
the presence of different groups of neurons called excita-
tory and inhibitory, which correspond to different signs
of the couplings [36, 64]. This approach has also been
extended to larger brain structures like different brain re-
gions: active/non-active regions are represented by spin
variables while their interaction is mimicked by the spin
alignment interaction [65].
• Models of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates based on
two populations of Ising spins in a cavity (a Dicke model)
that effectively interact nonreciprocally have been consid-
ered [11, 66, 67] to account for non-stationary dynamics
observed in experiments [68].
• Model inference in which symmetric and asymmet-
ric Ising models have also been used as a variational
ansatz [37, 69-72].
In several of these classes of systems, it has been con-
jectured that criticality may play a nontrivial role [73-
79].
Our nonreciprocal Ising model can be seen as a
stripped down version of these situations.
In realistic
cases, (i) there may be more than two populations (ii) the
spins may take more than two possible states and (iii) the
network topology may be more complex than Zd (see e.g.
Refs. [80, 81]). While these differences are likely to induce
additional complexities and phenomena, we expect that
the basic features of the nonreciprocal Ising model will
persist for systems in the same universality class [23, 74].
In particular, we expect that locally-coupled many-body
systems undergoing a Hopf bifurcation in mean-field will
enter this universality class even if they are not originally
composed of coupled spin-like degrees of freedom.
B.
Phase transitions to time-dependent states
An underlying motivation for this work is to con-
struct a bridge between bifurcations in non-variational
systems and phase transitions out of equilibrium.
In
the equilibrium Ising model, for instance, the ferromag-
net/paramagnet transition corresponds to a pitchfork bi-
furcation in mean-field. This means that the scalar order
parameter ϕ (e.g. the magnetization) follows the dynam-
ics (d/dt)ϕ = αϕ−ϕ3 in which α ∝T −Tc is proportional
to the distance from the critical temperature. Conversely,
the thermal field theory corresponding to locally-coupled
pitchfork bifurcations where
∂tϕ = αϕ −ϕ3 + D∆ϕ + η(t, r),
(1)
in which η is a thermal noise, leads upon renormaliza-
tion to the Ising critical point [27]. This dynamics can
be seen as the model A dynamics (in the formalism of Ho-
henberg and Halperin [82]) associated to a ϕ4 free energy
F, namely
Γ∂tϕ = −δF
δϕ
(2)
where Γ is a kinetic coefficient.
In nonreciprocal and other non-equilibrium systems,
the dynamics of the (not necessarily scalar) order pa-
rameter ⃗ϕ is typically non-variational,
Γ∂t⃗ϕ = ⃗f[⃗ϕ] ̸= −δF
δ⃗ϕ
(3)
so bifurcations with no analogue at equilibrium can oc-
cur, in particular those leading to limit cycles. The sim-
plest instance is the Hopf bifurcation, which describes
the appearance of a limit cycle from a fixed point, see
Refs. [83, 84]. Unless otherwise specified, "fixed points"
in this paper refer to fixed points of the physical dy-
namics, not fixed points of a renormalization group (RG)
flow. The Hopf bifurcation describes a variety of spatially
extended systems [85] ranging from oscillatory chemical
reactions and extended lasers [86] to models of mam-
malian hearing [87, 88]. This bifurcation is described by
the equation
˙z = (α + iω)z −|z|2z
(4)
for the complex numbers z and takes place at α = 0.
When z is replaced by a complex field ψ with appro-
priate diffusive couplings, the corresponding equation is
known as the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation [86].

3
The fate of this bifurcation has been analyzed using per-
turbative RG in Refs. [89, 90], and later reproduced and
generalized in Refs. [91, 92].
In these works, a phase
transition generalizing the Hopf bifurcation is predicted
based on a d = 4 −ϵ expansion and formally related
to the RG fixed point of model A dynamics with O(2)
symmetry (i.e., to the XY universality class). Using this
analogy Refs. [89, 90] predict that this phase transition,
which leads to an oscillating phase with long-range order,
should exist for space dimension d > 2, while no coherent
oscillations are expected in d < 2, and quasi-long-range
order in conjectured in d = 2 [93]. To the best of our
knowledge, these predictions have only been tested qual-
itatively, in Refs. [94, 95], where numerical simulations of
coupled three-state oscillators were performed for lattices
of size Ld going up to L = 80 in d = 3. A comparison of
the rescaled finite-size scaling data of Refs. [94, 95] with
Ising and XY exponents suggested a better collapse with
XY exponents. The results of our large-scale simulations
with lattices of sizes up to L = 320 in d = 3 are in agree-
ment with the predictions of Refs. [89, 90] and with the
qualitative observations of Refs. [94, 95]. In particular,
we obtain values of the critical exponents that are in very
good agreement with XY exponents but not with Ising
exponents.
The Hopf bifurcation is not the only way to produce a
limit cycle. Another relevant bifurcation is the infinite-
period bifurcation (or SNIC bifurcation) that describes
the creation of a limit cycle by a saddle-node bifurca-
tion that connects heteroclinic orbits together [83]. Here,
multiple SNIC bifurcations (related by symmetry) arise
at the same time in the mean-field transition from a static
ordered (symmetry-breaking) state to a limit cycle. To
the best of our knowledge, the field-theoretical version
of this class of bifurcations has not been studied. It has
been conjectured that it does not exist in spatially ex-
tended systems of arbitrary dimension in Ref. [96] based
on the instability of the static ordered state in the three-
state oscillator model of Refs. [94, 95]. Our simulations
suggest that a static ordered state can exist despite the
presence of nonreciprocal coupling (provided that they
are not fully anti-symmetric, at least in our model), but
even in this case we did not find evidence of any di-
rect transition between the static-order and oscillating
phases.
C.
Stability of spatially coherent oscillations
Our work is also directly related to the question of the
stability and spatial coherence of time-periodic phases in
noisy locally-coupled classical many-body systems. By
considering the nucleation and growth of droplets from
fluctuations, Ref. [97-100] argued that spatially coher-
ent oscillations are unstable in the thermodynamic limit
if they arise from the spontaneous breaking of a dis-
crete time-translation invariance (in particular when the
period of oscillation is commensurate with the discrete
time unit characterizing the evolution) [101].
This is
not the case in our model, where the oscillating phase
arises from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous
time-translation invariance (and the period is generically
incommensurate with the discrete time unit). The case
of spontaneously broken continuous time-translation in-
variance is considered in Refs. [99, 100, 102] using a map-
ping between the desynchronization of local oscillators
and the roughening of surfaces described by the Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [103]. In the KPZ univer-
sality class, surfaces are always rough in d ≤2, while
two phases (rough or smooth) are possible for d > 2, see
e.g. § 5.7.4 of Ref. [104]. Based on this mapping, it is
argued that temporal order can exist in d > 2 but not
in d ≤2 in isotropic systems. Note that in the mapping
to the KPZ equation, the angular nature of phase vari-
ables (defined on a compact space) is neglected, which
amounts to ignoring topological defects, expected not to
affect the large-scale physics [102]. A compact version
of the KPZ equation has been studied in Refs. [105-
108], but not in isotropic systems in d = 3. Similarly,
Refs. [91, 109] suggested an analogy with the Mermin-
Wagner theorem [82, 110] in the time domain, according
to which the fluctuations of the Goldstone modes associ-
ated with broken time-translation invariance destroy or-
der in d ≤2.
References [111-118] performed numerical simulations
of cellular automata and coupled map lattices (see
Ref. [112] for an introduction) in various space dimen-
sions, from which it emerged that periodic oscillations are
possible for d ≥3 within this class of sytems [113, 119,
120]. Similar behaviors were reported in simulations of
predator-prey models on lattice [23, 27, 121-126]. These
results are in agreement with the theoretical arguments
reviewed above, and are are also consistent with our nu-
merical observations. Similar questions arise in the study
of the synchronization of locally coupled oscillators with
randomly distributed frequencies (like in the Kuramoto
model), see § IV.A of Ref. [127] and references therein,
but the physics is different because of the random fre-
quencies.
D.
Classical continuous time crystals
The works reviewed in the previous paragraphs are pri-
marily concerned with the spatial coherence of the oscil-
lations.
In a nutshell, they ask whether there can be
macroscopic quantities averaged over the entire system
(such as the magnetization; we call these order param-
eters) that oscillate forever. When this is the case, we
can ask another question: is the oscillation of the macro-
scopic order parameter temporally coherent?
In other
words, is it acting as a good clock? Addressing this ques-
tion is another of the key motivations of our work. To
illustrate the difference, let us consider a simple noisy
phase oscillator
˙ϕ = ω +
p
2Dϕη(t)
(5)

4
where η(t) is a white noise with ⟨η⟩= 0 and ⟨η(t)η(t′)⟩=
δ(t −t′).
Here, ϕ can be seen as the argument of
a complex number z(t) = Aeiϕ(t) whose amplitude A
is very quickly relaxing to its steady-state value.
In
this simple system, we observe that the average value
⟨ϕ⟩always oscillates (averaging the equation of motion
leads to ⟨ϕ(t)⟩= ϕ(0) + ωt).
However, this oscillator
only keeps track of time (i.e.
of its initial phase) for
so long. To see that, consider the correlation function
C(t) = ⟨ei[ϕ(t)−ϕ(0)]⟩which describes the average phase
that an assembly of independent clocks would have at
time t, provided that they were synchronized at time
t = 0. Here, it behaves as [128]
C(t) ∝cos(ωt)e−t/τ
(6)
where τ = 1/Dϕ, meaning that the oscillator loses track
of its original phase after Q = ωτ oscillations (Q is known
as the quality factor of the noisy oscillator). In fact, any
noisy oscillator behaves in this way at long times [129].
Thermodynamic bounds on the number Q of coherent
oscillations have been considered [130-133], and suggest
that an infinite amount of energy (more precisely of en-
tropy production) is needed to obtain infinite coherence.
It is however not excluded that a macroscopic system in
the thermodynamic limit can have an infinite coherence
time with a finite cost per unit volume. Our numerical
results suggest that this indeed happens in our model: we
evaluate the coherence time of oscillations, which scales
as τ(L) ∼L3 (in d = 3). This points to the existence
of perfectly coherent oscillations in the thermodynamic
limit. Additionally, we measure the entropy production
rate per unit volume and find that it converges to a fi-
nite value, independent of system size. In this sense, our
model can be seen as a classical continuous time crys-
tal [134-147]. We conjecture that this property may ex-
tend to other systems with locally coupled oscillators that
spontaneously break a continuous time-translation sym-
metry.

OUTLINE AND SUMMARY
The outline of the paper is as follows: we present the
nonreciprocal Ising model with general asymmetric cou-
pling between the two species and derive its mean-field
equation in Sec. IV. In Secs. V and VII-XI we restrict
ourselves to the fully anti-symmetric case in which the
system exhibits C4 symmetry. In Sec. IV we show that
the mean-field equation predicts three distinct phases:
disorder, time-dependent order that we dub "swap", and
static order, and analyze the bifurcations that separate
the phases. Details on the Monte-Carlo simulations are
given in Sec. VI. Our numerical simulations in 2D are
presented in Sec. VII, suggesting that the swap phase is
unstable in 2D due to spiral defects. In Sec. VIII we show
that the swap phase is stable in 3D, and calculate the
static critical exponents of the phase transition from dis-
order to swap. These critical exponents are in excellent
agreement with the equilibrium XY critical exponents,
which is compatible with renormalization-group studies
and with the breaking of a continuous time-translation
symmetry. We calculate the coherence time of the mag-
netization and show that it grows with system size, sug-
gesting a time-crystal behavior in the thermodynamic
limit.
In Sec. IX, we provide numerical evidence and
theoretical arguments that suggest that the static-order
phase is destroyed in any finite dimension due to droplet
growth. In Sec. X we discuss how the system coarsens
into swap and static-order states. The phase diagram of
the fully anti-symmetric case is summarized in Sec. XI. In
Sec. XII we allow the presence of inter-species reciprocal
couplings, which reduces the symmetry to Z2, and ac-
counts for a general asymmetric interaction. We present
mean-field analysis and 2D and 3D simulation results.
These results reveal that the swap phase stability is un-
changed with respect to the fully anti-symmetric case
(i.e. it is stable in 3D but not in 2D). However, static
order can be restored by an intriguing droplet-capture
mechanism. Contrary to the mean-field prediction, we
find no evidence of a direct transition between the swap
and the static-order phase. We summarize our results
and conclusions in Sec. XIII.
IV.
THE MODEL
In the equilibrium Ising model, adjacent on-lattice
spins (σ = ±1) stochastically align with one another
through an energy function.
Its dynamics is given by
kinetic Ising models which, while lacking uniqueness, al-
ways operate by minimizing the global free energy. In
what follows, we generalize these kinetic Ising models to
the case of nonreciprocal interactions where such global
potential function does not exist. To this aim, we define
a Glauber dynamics [148] where each spin tends to min-
imize its own selfish energy. Similar formulations were
used among the physical sciences [6, 20, 35, 52, 65, 149-
154].
A.
The nonreciprocal (NR) Ising model
We consider two spin species, labeled by Greek indices
α = A, B, located on a d-dimensional cubic lattice of
linear size L. Each site i ∈{1, ..., Ld} contains one A-
spin and one B-spin (Fig. 1, left). The state of the system
is described by a vector
⃗σ = {σA
1 , ..., σA
Ld, σB
1 , ..., σB
Ld}
(7)
in which each spin σα
i = ±1.
We consider transition rates given by the general-
ized Glauber dynamics [148] in which the transition rate
w(⃗σ|⃗σ′) from configuration ⃗σ to ⃗σ′ is given by
w(F α
i ⃗σ|⃗σ) = 1

species B (red), between spins of different species.

is the difference in selfish energy between the states. Here
F α
i is a single-spin-flipping operator, i.e., when acting on
⃗σ it flips the α-species spin on site i from σα
i to −σα
i while
keeping all the other spins unchanged. For instance,

and J, K+, K−> 0. The sum in Eq. (11) runs over near-
est neighbors of i and summation over spin indices β is
implied. The selfish energy indicates that spins of the
same species tend to align with their neighbors, while
spins of different species interact nonreciprocally (see
Fig. 1, right): spins A tend to align with spins B, whereas
spins B either tend to align with spins B but to a lesser
extent (if K+ > K−), or tend to anti-align with spins A
(if K+ < K−). The latter case will be the main focus
of this paper as it leads to a rich phenomenology related
to limit cycles. Note that in our model, inter-species in-
teractions only occur between spins located on the same
site.

As detailed in Sec. VI, we perform Monte-Carlo simula-

We note that the Glauber dynamics of the nonrecip-
rocal Ising model can be written in terms of a new vari-
able θi (instead of σα

four values respectively corresponding to the four possi-
ble states per site: π/4 (↑↑), 3π/4 (↓↑), 5π/4 (↓↓), and
7π/4 (↑↓) (see Fig. 2 and an explicit mapping for the fully
anti-symmetric case in Sec. V A). The color code given
in Fig. 2 is used throughout the paper.

by the sign of K−(throughout the paper K−> 0 which im-
plies clockwise direction).
B.
Broken detailed balance
We now show that the nonreciprocal Ising model de-
scribed in the previous section is out of equilibrium, in
the sense that it breaks detailed balance.
A Markov chain with rates w satisfies detailed balance
if it has a stationary distribution P ss such that
w(⃗σ →⃗σ′)
w(⃗σ′ →⃗σ) = P ss(⃗σ′)
P ss(⃗σ) .
(14)
Let us assume that our kinetic model possesses an (un-
known) stationary distribution P ss(⃗σ).
Considering a
loop ⃗σ1 →⃗σ2 →· · · →⃗σn in state space, as well as
the same loop travelled in opposite direction, detailed
balance implies [155]
w(⃗σ1 →⃗σ2)
w(⃗σ1 →⃗σn) ·
w(⃗σ2 →⃗σ3)
w(⃗σn →⃗σn−1) · · · w(⃗σn →⃗σ1)
w(⃗σ2 →⃗σ1) = 1. (15)

6
If we find a cycle such that this ratio is not unity, then
detailed balance cannot be satisfied. This is known as
the Kolmogorov criterion. Here, a relevant cycle to con-
sider consists in flipping the spins (σA
i , σB
i ) of a fixed site
i according to ↑↑→↑↓→↓↓→↓↑→↑↑, while keeping all the
other spins unchanged. Using Eqs. (8), (11) and assum-
ing all the neighboring spins are up, we obtain
w (↑↑→↑↓) = f( ˜J + ˜K+ −˜K−)
w (↑↓→↓↓) = f( ˜J −˜K+ −˜K−)
w (↓↓→↓↑) = f(−˜J + ˜K+ −˜K−)
w (↓↑→↑↑) = f(−˜J −˜K+ −˜K−)
w (↑↑→↓↑) = f( ˜J + ˜K+ + ˜K−)
w (↓↑→↓↓) = f( ˜J −˜K+ + ˜K−)
w (↓↓→↑↓) = f(−˜J + ˜K+ + ˜K−)
w (↑↓→↑↑) = f(−˜J −˜K+ + ˜K−)
(16)
where f(x) ≡(1 −tanh(x)) /(2τ) and we defined the nor-
malized coupling coefficients ˜K−= K−/(kBT), ˜K+ =
K+/(kBT) and ˜J ≡2dJ/(kBT).
Using the identity
(1+tanh(x))/(1−tanh(x)) = e2x we find that the forward
and reverse cycles satisfy
w (↑↑→↑↓) w (↑↓→↓↓) w (↓↓→↓↑) w (↓↑→↑↑)
w (↑↑→↓↑) w (↓↑→↓↓) w (↓↓→↑↓) w (↑↓→↑↑) = e8 ˜
K−
(17)
which means that detailed balance is broken in our model
whenever ˜K−̸= 0.
The breaking of detailed balance
implies the system is driven away from equilibrium. Un-
der certain assumptions on the physical realization of the
model that go by the name of local detailed balance [156-
158], the cycle produces entropy ∆S/kB = 8 ˜K−(see Ap-
pendix A for details).
We refer to Refs. [159-163] for
discussions about irreversibility and entropy production
in nonequilibrium phase transitions.
C.
The mean-field (MF) equation
We now derive mean-field (MF) equations of motion for
the magnetizations of each species from the master equa-
tion (13) (see Refs. [164-166]). The mean-field equations
are a useful guide, but it is not expected that they accu-
rately describe the behavior of the system in any finite
dimension.

THE FULLY ANTI-SYMMETRIC CASE
In this section as well as in Secs. VII-XI, we will study
the fully anti-symmetric case, in which K+ = 0.
To
simplify the notations, we write K−≡K (and ˜K−≡˜K).
In this case, the mean-field equation reads
∂tmα = −mα+tanh

where εαβ is the Levi-Civita symbol. Equation (25) has
the symmetry
S2 : (mA, mB) 7→(−mB, mA)
(26)
in addition to that in Eq. (24), so overall it is invariant
under the cyclic group C4.

with the sum running over nearest-neighbor pairs. Equa-
tions (27-29) can be viewed as describing locally-coupled
oscillators with internal frequency and discrete states. In
this sense, they share similarities with the Wood et al.
cyclic model [94-96] although oscillators are restricted to
forward moves (backward moves are prohibited) in these
references. For K = 0, our model reaches an equilibrium
state that is equivalent to the clock model (vector Potts
model) for q = 4 [167, 168].
B.
Analysis of the bifurcations
In the mα ≪1 limit and for small gradients, the mean-
field equation in the fully anti-symmetric case (Eq. (25))
can be approximated by
∂tmα = −(1 −˜J)mα + ˜Kεαβmβ + D∇2mα
−1


˜Jmα + ˜Kεαβmβ

(30)
For ˜K = 0, Eq. (30) reduces to two uncoupled mean-field
equations that derive from a ϕ4 Ginzburg-Landau poten-
tial. For any ˜K ̸= 0, Eq. (30) does not derive from a
potential, and describes a non-equilibrium system. Note
that due to the lack of rotational symmetry in the cu-
bic term, Eq. (30) differs from the Complex Ginzburg-
Landau (CGL) equation [86, 169], which is given by
∂tψ = aψ + b∇2ψ + c|ψ|2ψ
(31)
where ψ(⃗r, t) is a complex field and a, b and c are complex
numbers. However, Eq. (30) becomes CGL-like in limits
discussed below.
Here, we restrict our analysis to spatially homoge-
neous solutions, mα(⃗r, t) ≡mα(t). The linear stability
of such solutions to Eq. (30) is unaffected by the Lapla-
cian term, and we therefore analyze the spatially homo-
geneous mean-field equation given by
∂tmα = −(1 −˜J)mα + ˜Kεαβmβ

Figure 3 shows the phase-space velocity field ⃗v =
(∂tmA, ∂tmB) from the spatially homogeneous full mean-
field equation, Eq. (25) along with the fixed points which
are obtained by numerically solving the ∂tmA = ∂tmB =
0 equations. The stability of the fixed points (shown in
the figure as orange, pink, and brown for stable, saddle,
and unstable, respectively) is determined by analyzing
the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix J of the linearized
equation ∂tδ⃗m = J δ⃗m where linearization is performed
around each fixed point.
Three distinct phases are found: a disordered phase
in which mA = mB = 0 is the only stable fixed point
(Fig. 3a), a limit-cycle phase that we dub "swap phase"
as both species repeatedly flip their magnetizations
(Fig. 3b), and a static-order (ferromagnetic) phase in
which, depending on initial conditions, the system ends

8
up in one out of four stable fixed points with non-zero
mA and mB (Fig. 3c).
The mean-field phase diagram obtained from the spa-
tially homogeneous full mean-field equation is shown in
Fig. 4, as a function of the couplings ˜J and ˜K.
The
phases are determined by the fixed points and their sta-
bility as described above. When nonreciprocal interac-
tions are turned off ( ˜K = 0), a pitchfork bifurcation at
˜J = 1 (red point in Fig. 4) separates the disordered phase
(in blue) from the static-order phase (in green), as in the
usual Ising model. When nonreciprocal interactions are
present ( ˜K ̸= 0), the swap phase arises (in pink) and is
separated from the disordered state by a Hopf bifurcation
at ˜J = 1 (green line), and from the static-order phase by
another bifurcation known as a (C4-symmetric) saddle-
node on an invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation [64, 83]
(blue line). We analyze each of these bifurcations below
using Eq. (32).

of the spatially homogeneous Eq. (25).
1.
Pitchfork bifurcation
For ˜K = 0, Eq. (32) leads to the standard pitchfork
bifurcation at ˜J = 1. The mA = mB = 0 point becomes
unstable and four stable fixed points
mA = ±mB = ±
s

emerge, corresponding to the ordered phase.
2.
Hopf bifurcation
For ˜K ̸= 0, the eigenvalues of J at mA = mB = 0 are
complex,
λ1,2 = −1 + ˜J ± i ˜K.
(34)
This means that there is a Hopf bifurcation at ˜J = 1:
the mA = mB = 0 point become unstable for ˜J > 1 and
a stable limit cycle emerges, corresponding to the swap
phase.
The limit cycle is more easily analyzed in polar coor-
dinates, mA = r cos θ and mB = r sin θ where Eq. (32)
becomes

The limit cycle describes anharmonic oscillations,
where both r and ˙θ vary with θ.
Its shape has a ro-
tational symmetry of order 4 due to the C4 symmetry of
the mean-field equation. However, very close to the bi-
furcation, i.e. ˜J −1 ≪1 and any fixed ˜K, the oscillations
are harmonic [85]. This can be seen as follows.
The equation for θ in the ˜J −1 ≪1 limit is
∂tθ = −˜K + O( ˜J −1) ,
(37)
where we used the fact that r2 ∼˜J −1.
The angle θ
then has the solution θ = θ0 −˜Kt, and the equation for
r becomes

˜J −1
1 + ˜K2
(41)
which is a circular motion of constant angular velocity in
phase space. This harmonic solution can be rationalized
by looking at the two times scales corresponding respec-
tively to the angular and radial motion near the bifurca-
tion (described by Eqs. (37) and (38), respectively). The
angular motion time scale is Tθ ∼˜K−1 while the radial
motion time scale is determined by the relaxation time of
r(t) to its new minimum when θ changes, which scales as
Tr ∼( ˜J −1)−1. The two time scales Tθ and Tr can be in-
terpreted as "oscillation time-scale" and "alignment time-
scale", respectively. Since Tr ≫Tθ, the angular motion
occurs much more rapidly, leaving insufficient time for r
to reach a new minimum when θ changes. Thus, only
the θ-averaged value of the right-hand side of Eq. (35)
matters. This is supported by Fig. 5 which shows typical
phase-space trajectories in the swap phase: as ˜J −1 in-
creases, the motion indeed loses its rotational symmetry
and become more "square-like".
The above result is a consequence of a more gen-
eral theorem. A reaction-diffusion equation that under-
goes a Hopf bifurcation such as the mean-field evolu-
tion Eq. (30) can be reduced, close to the bifurcation, to
the CGL equation (i.e., the CGL equation is its normal
form). The transformation to the CGL equation guaran-
tees that the steady-state solution of the non-transformed
set of equations is an elliptical limit cycle (or in special
cases like here, circular) [85]. Because of this reduction,
we expect the disorder-to-swap phase transition in our
model to be in the same universality class as the Hopf
bifurcation in the CGL equation, which has been studied
in Refs. [89, 90].
3.
Infinite-period (SNIC) bifurcation
Let us now start from the limit-cycle swap phase.
Upon increasing ˜J or decreasing
˜K, the system goes
through a (C4-symmetric) saddle-node on an invariant
circle (SNIC) bifurcation, where four pairs of stable and
saddle fixed points emerge from the limit cycle (pink and
orange points in Fig. 3c). The SNIC bifurcation is also
known under several other names: infinite-period bifur-
cation (because the period of oscillation diverges at the
bifurcation point), saddle-node on a limit cycle (SNLC),
saddle-node infinite-period (SNIPER), etc. As the dy-
namics is invariant under the action of the group C4 (see
Sec. V), four copies of the SNIC bifurcation happen at
the same time. Bifurcations in such a dynamical system
with symmetries are known as equivariant bifurcations,
see Refs. [170-172] for an introduction. Once the stable
fixed points emerge, the system is in a static-order phase.
Noticing that the SNIC bifurcation occurs when ˜K and
˜J −1 are comparable (see Fig. 4), we now take the limit
ϵ →0 with ˜J −1 ∼ϵ and ˜K ∼ϵ. At first order in ϵ,
Eqs. (35-36) become
∂tr = ( ˜J −1) r −1

In a static-order state, ∂tr = ∂tθ = 0, with r given by
r = 2
s
˜J −1
1 + 1
3 cos(4θ) .
(43)
The equation for θ then becomes
∂tθ = −˜K +
sin(4θ)
3 + cos(4θ)( ˜J −1).
(44)
Since sin(4θ)/(3+cos(4θ)) is bounded between −1/(2
√
2)
and 1/(2
√
2), a stationary state (with ∂tθ = 0) can only
exist if ˜K < ( ˜J −1)/(2
√
2). Therefore, in the ˜J −1 ≪1
regime, the SNIC bifurcation line corresponds to
˜K =
˜J −1
2

2 .
(45)
Note that, in Fig. 4, the thick blue line corresponding to
the SNIC bifurcation was obtained numerically for the
full mean-field dynamics Eq. (25). Equation (45) only
predicts the tangent of this thick blue line close to the
pitchfork bifurcation point ( ˜J = 1, ˜K = 0).
Finally, the fixed points emerging at the SNIC bifur-
cation are obtained from the θ values that maximize
sin(4θ)/(3 + cos(4θ)), which are

(47)
Approaching the SNIC bifurcation from the side of the
limit cycle (swap phase), ∂tθ approaches zero when the
system passes at θ = θn. As a result, the oscillation pe-
riod diverges at the bifurcation (see Fig. 5d-f, where the
period increases as we approach the bifurcation). This
stands in contrast with the Hopf bifurcation in which the
oscillation period remains finite.

VI.
MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS
To go beyond the mean-field description, we perform
large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations of the nonreciprocal
Ising model in both two and three dimensions (results in
one dimension are summarized in Appendix B).
In our 2D discrete-time Monte-Carlo (MC) simula-
tions, we use the standard Glauber algorithm: at each
MC step a spin σα
i is chosen at random and then flipped
with probability
pα
i = τw(F α
i ⃗σ|⃗σ)
(48)
(with w defined in Eq. (8)).
Since three-dimensional simulations are much more
costly, in 3D we update spins using a checkerboard algo-
rithm to implement Eq. (48) instead of random picking.
In the checkerboard algorithm non-interacting spins are
flipped in parallel [173]. To generalize the checkerboard
approach to the two-species case, we defined the quantity
P = x1+x2+x3+α where xn is the integer position in the
n-th dimension of the cubic lattice, and α = 0, 1 labels
the two species. Spins with the same parity of P (even
or odd) are then updated simultaneously.
This allows
us both to parallelize the simulation and avoid random
number generation in choosing the spins. We did not ob-
serve qualitative changes when changing the update rules
from random picking to paralleled checkerboard, as well
as when using other update rules, see Appendix C.
Unless mentioned otherwise, we initialize the system
in an ordered state where all spins of the same species
are either up or down, and let the system evolve until a
steady state is reached. Averages are then calculated in
the steady state, excluding the initial transient. Time is
measured in simulation sweeps, where a single sweep is
defined as 2 × Ld (the number of spins) MC steps (indi-
vidual attempted flips). To best visualize phenomena of
interest, simulation snapshots are presented either with
the spin variables σA and σB, or with the angle variable
θ.
Transitions from disorder to time-dependent order and
from time-dependent order to stationary order can be
quantified by two order parameters. First, the synchro-
nization order parameter
R ≡⟨s⟩t,Ω
with s ≡
r
M 2
A + M 2

(49)
quantifies how much spins are aligned with each other
within each species. Here, Mα = P
i σα
i /Ld are the total
magnetizations and the average ⟨...⟩t,Ωis over time (t)
and realizations (Ω). Note that s can also be written as
s = 1

(50)
similarly to the order parameter quantifying the synchro-
nization of oscillations in, for example, the Kuramoto
model [127]. Second, the phase-space angular momen-
tum
L ≡⟨ℓ⟩t,Ωwith ℓ≡MB∂tMA −MA∂tMB
= MB,tMA,t+1 −MA,tMB,t+1
(51)
quantifies
the

breaking. It is related to the entropy production [174],
see Appendix A for details.

11
Mean-field behavior of the order parameters
In mean-field and for a spatially uniform state, the
synchronization order parameter defined in Eq. (49) is
RMF = ⟨r⟩t
√
2
(52)
and the phase-space angular momentum defined in
Eq. (51) is
LMF = −⟨r2 ˙θ⟩t.
(53)
The sign is chosen so that L is positive when K is posi-
tive. In Fig. 6, RMF and LMF, calculated from a numer-
ical steady-state solution of the spatially homogeneous
Eq. (25), are plotted as a function of ˜J for a fixed value of
˜K. It is shown that RMF goes from zero to non-zero val-
ues when crossing the Hopf bifurcation at ˜J = 1. When
crossing the SNIC bifurcation, RMF remains finite, but
there is a sharp change in the slope: the slope increases
when approaching the bifurcation and decreases in the
static order regime. Conversely, LMF is identically zero
in both the disordered and static-order phases, but devi-
ates from zero in the swap phase. Both RMF and LMF
are continuous at the bifurcation points, as in a second-
order phase transition. In the swap phase and near the
Hopf bifurcation, we can use Eq. (37) and Eq. (41) to
obtain
RMF =
s
2( ˜J −1)
1 + ˜K2
and
LMF = 4 ˜K( ˜J −1)
1 + ˜K2
.
(54)
In the swap phase and near the SNIC bifurcation, LMF
scales with µ1/2 where µ is the distance from the bifur-
cation line (because the period scales as T ∼µ−1/2 while
r remains finite at the bifurcation [83]). We now analyze
how these mean-field results hold in finite-dimensional
systems using the Monte-Carlo simulations.
VII.
DESTRUCTION OF THE SWAP PHASE IN
2D BY SPIRAL DEFECTS
In small 2D systems, simulations show states in which
MA and MB oscillate in time (like in the mean-field swap
phase). These oscillations are irregular, and typically oc-
cur through nucleation of droplets of opposite magneti-
zation by the "unsatisfied" species, in alternating order
(see Movie 1).
However, as L increases these oscillations become a
transient that quickly destabilizes (see Fig. 7) due to the
formation and proliferation of spiral defects. Figure 8 and
Movie 1 show the emergence of defects after an oscilla-
tory transient. The defects are manifest in the θ variable
and appear to have four distinct arms, ordered according
to the cycle ↑↑→↑↓→↓↓→↓↑that can be followed either
clockwise (+ defects) or anti-clockwise (−defects). The
4-fold rotational symmetry in the spiral shape stems from

case, and is even more visible in the mean-field equation,
see Fig. 8c displaying a snapshot of a spiral obtained from
integrating numerically Eq. (30) with a boundary condi-

In terms of the
complex order parameter ψ = mA + imB, the C4 sym-

satisfying e−iθ ψ(Rθ⃗r, t) = ψ(⃗r, t) for θ = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2,
where Rθ is the rotation matrix with angle θ.
Despite having 4-fold rather than full rotational sym-
metric shape, the spiral waves observed in the nonrecip-
rocal Ising model appear to behave similarly to those
emerging in the CGL equation [86, 102, 106, 107, 177-

Note the 4-fold rotational symmetry. Panels a-b are produced from the same MC simulation, with the parameters: ˜J = 2.8,
˜K = 0.3, and L = 150. Panel c is obtained by solving numerically Eq. (30) on a disk of radius Rsim with boundary conditions
ψ(r = Rsim, θ) = ψ0eiθ (r and θ are polar coordinates) that enforce the existence of a topological defect. We have set ˜J = 2,
˜K = 0.6, D = 0.5, Rsim = 10. Equation (30) is integrated using the pseudospectral solver Dedalus [175] on a disk domain
discretized with Nϕ = 201 azimuthal modes and Nr = 200 radial modes using a 1st-order 1-stage diagonally implicit-explicit
Runge-Kutta scheme (RK111 in Dedalus) [176] with a fixed time step dt = 1 × 10−2 for 20 simulation time units.
185]. Defects are created and annihilated in pairs and
opposite topological charges (+ and −defects) lead to
opposite angular velocities (see Movie 1).
Finally we
note that in mean-field, a homogeneously oscillating sys-
tem is stable, but given sufficiently strong added noise
spirals emerge, as in our Monte-Carlo simulations (see
Appendix D).
Quantitatively, the absence of a swap phase in the
thermodynamic limit can be seen from the behavior of
the order parameters R and L (Eq. (49) and (51), re-
spectively) as system size increases. In Fig. 9a-d color
maps of R and L are shown as a function of ˜J and ˜K
for small (L = 20) and large (L = 80) systems. For the
L = 20 system, there is a region in which both R and L
are non-zero, compatible with the swap phase. However,
for the L = 80 system, both R and L diminish in this
region, indicating instead a disorder phase. Figures 9e
and 9f show the order parameters as function of ˜J for
fixed ˜K, at different system sizes. The intermediate re-
gion (1.5 ≲˜J ≲3) corresponds to the finite-system swap
state, but both R and L approach zero as L increases.
In addition, the putative critical ˜J marking the transi-
tion from disorder to swap depends on the system size,
signifying the absence of a well-defined phase transition
in the thermodynamic limit.
To conclude, our numerical simulations indicate that
the mean-field swap phase is destroyed by spiral defects
in 2D where it is replaced by a disordered state.
VIII.
EXISTENCE OF A STABLE SWAP PHASE
IN 3D
In 3D, numerical simulations suggest that a stable
swap phase does exist. Its behavior is demonstrated in
Fig. 10 where we show a kymograph of the θ-field of a
single 1D row in the 3D lattice as well as a plot of the
total magnetizations and s (Eq. (49)) as a function of
time. A full visualization of this phase is shown in Movie
2. Unlike the 2D droplet-induced swap persisting at fi-
nite systems (Movie 1), here the oscillations are noisy and
spatially homogeneous, without any apparent structures.
Moreover, MA(t) and MB(t) display coherent oscillations
with a fixed period and phase shift between the species.
Simulations with varying system sizes indicate there
is a well-defined phase transition between a disordered
phase with R = L = 0 to a swap phase with non-zero
R and L.

Fig. 12a-b shows a cut of the color maps for ˜K = 0.3 with
different L values. The inset of Fig. 12a shows two differ-
ent behaviors depending on whether ˜J is above or below
a critical value ˜Jc, unlike in 2D (Fig. 9). Below ˜Jc, R ap-
proaches zero with R ∼L−d/2 scaling as L increases: this
corresponds to the disordered phase. Above ˜Jc, R con-
verges to a finite non-zero value as L increases: this corre-
sponds to an ordered phase, here the swap phase. More-
over, the phase transition appears to be second-order in
the sense that R and L change continuously.
The critical ˜Jc separating disorder from swap is ˜K de-
pendent (see Fig. 11), in contrast with the mean-field
prediction (Fig. 4). In the ˜K →∞limit, and for any ˜J,
the swap phase is unstable and both R and L are zero.
This stems from the fact that when ˜K ≫˜J, each spin
responds to the local force imposed by the other species
and disregards alignment with its neighbors. As a result,
each site performs rapid cycles (↑↑→↑↓→↓↓→↓↑→↑↑),
but neighboring sites are not synchronized. A phase tran-
sition similar to the one in Fig. 12a-b (continuous in R
and L) is observed for a fixed ˜J cut (see Fig. 12c in which
˜J = 1.5). Both R and L are zero at large ˜K and become
finite below some critical ˜Kc ( ˜K ≈0.5 in Fig. 12c).
Note that the second-order phase transition between
disorder and swap is limited to small ˜J and ˜K values.
At high values of ˜J and ˜K, the transition appears to be
discontinuous. This is discussed further in Sec. VIII C.

A.
Critical exponents
Having numerically confirmed the existence of a con-
tinuous phase transition from disorder to swap in 3D, we
move on to determine the related critical exponents, fo-
cusing on the order parameter R = ⟨s⟩(averages here
and in the following discussion are with respect to time
and realizations but for brevity, we remove the t and Ω
subscripts). Note that L is not expected to yield novel
critical exponents because at the Hopf bifurcation the
angular velocity in phase space is finite (see Eq. (37) for
mean-field and Fig. 24 for simulation evidence), and so
the phase-space angular momentum scales with ⟨s2⟩.
As predicted by the mean-field analysis, the phase-
space trajectories become circular when approaching the
transition line (Fig. 13), supporting a CGL-like behavior
as explained in Sec. V B 2.
Moreover, renormalization
group studies based on the ϵ-expansion suggest that the
synchronization transition of the CGL equation with ad-
ditive noise belongs to the same universality class as the

phase transition from disorder to long-range order in the
XY model [89, 90]. Thus, in what follows we will compare
our results to the 3D XY critical exponents and to the
3D Ising critical exponents corresponding to the ˜K = 0
case.
According to the theory of finite-size scaling [186, 187],
in a finite system the order parameter R, the susceptibil-
ity χ, defined as
χ = Ld  ⟨s2⟩−⟨s⟩2
,
(55)
and the Binder cumulant [188] defined as
U = 1 −
⟨s4⟩
3⟨s2⟩2 ,
(56)
satisfy the following relations in the vicinity of the critical
point ˜Jc (assuming fixed ˜K) and for large system size:
R = L−β/ν ˆR(L1/ν( ˜J −˜Jc))
χ = Lγ/ν ˆχ(L1/ν( ˜J −˜Jc))
U = ˆU(L1/ν( ˜J −˜Jc)).
(57)
Here, ˆχ(x), ˆR(x), and ˆU(x) are called the scaling func-
tions, and ν, γ and β are the critical exponents ξ ∼| ˜J −
˜Jc|−ν where ξ is the correlation length, χ ∼| ˜J −˜Jc|−γ,
and R ∼| ˜J −˜Jc|β (for ˜J > ˜Jc). The scaling functions
are independent of L and converge to a finite value at the
critical point (i.e.
ˆR(0), ˆχ(0) and ˆU(0) are constants).
In what follows we assume that the finite-size scaling the-
ory holds out of equilibrium, as is often done [189]. We
set ˜K = 0.1 where numerical evidence shows that the
transition is continuous (like a second-order transition).
The critical point ˜Jc is found using the Binder cumu-
lant. Away from the critical point, the value of U depends
on system size, approaching 1/3 in the disordered and 2/3
in the ordered regime as L →∞[190, 191]. However, at
the critical point U approaches a fixed value U( ˜Jc) = U ∗
independent of L. Hence, the critical point is found from
the intersection point of all the U vs. ˜J curves plotted for
different system sizes. Figure 14a shows that indeed all
the curves cross at a single point ( ˜Jc = 1.34614±0.00001
for ˜K = 0.1).
In addition to U, we plot χ and R as a func-
tion
of
˜J,
see
Fig.
14a-c.
The
data
points
are interpolated using a cubic spline method with
'not-a-knot' boundary conditions as implemented in
scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline [192].
For each lin-
ear system size L, we find the slope of U at the critical
point, dU/d ˜J| ˜
J= ˜
Jc(L), the maximum of χ, χmax(L), and
the value of R at the critical point, R( ˜J = ˜Jc, L). We
then use the finite-size scaling relations (which can be
derived from Eq. (57) [186, 187])

(58)
and perform linear fits by taking the logarithm of both
sides of the equations (Fig. 14(d-f)). The procedure out-
lined here yields the critical exponents. To ensure good
accuracy, all averages are taken using 106 samples. To
make the samples approximately independent, they are
separated by two correlation times of s (the correlation
times were computed at ˜J = 1.346). Simulation runs are
initialized in a fully disordered state. The error is esti-
mated using the bootstrap method [186, 193]: the same
procedure is repeated for multiple samples where each
sample is constructed by drawing 106 measurements of s
randomly from our data while allowing duplicates. The
standard deviation of the critical exponents is estimated
by the standard deviation calculated from 105 bootstrap
resamplings of the data (Fig. 14(g-i)).
This estimated
error is due to finite sampling but does not include other
systematic errors (e.g. finite-size corrections to Eqs. (57-
58) [187]). Our results are
ν = 0.675 ± 0.005
γ = 1.328 ± 0.009
β = 0.347 ± 0.002 ,
(59)
which are all in good agreement with 3D XY criti-
cal exponents νXY
= 0.672, γXY
= 1.318, βXY
=
0.349 [194, 195], more so than with 3D Ising critical ex-
ponents νI = 0.630, γI = 1.237, βI = 0.326 [194], see
graphical comparison in Fig. 15. Further evidence that
the disorder-to-swap phase transition belongs to the same
universality class as the disorder-to-order XY phase tran-
sition is given by the value of the Binder cumulant as the
critical point, U( ˜Jc) = U ∗, which is also universal [188].
We find
U ∗= 0.5877 ± 0.0002 ,
(60)
consistent with studies on the 3D XY model reporting
U ∗≈0.586 [196]. In contrast, the 3D Ising model yields
U ∗≈0.467 [197].

B.
Time-crystal behavior
On top of being globally ordered and time-dependent,
the 3D swap phase possesses another notable prop-
erty: its coherence time diverges because of its many-
body nature, making it a time crystal [134, 135, 140-
144, 146, 147].
To understand this feature, consider a single limit cy-
cle oscillator subject to noise. This can be represented
by the zero-dimensional mean-field equation of the non-
reciprocal Ising model with added noise, defined as
dmα
dt
= −mα + tanh( ˜Jmα + ˜Kεαβmβ) + ηα ,
(61)
where ηα is white noise satisfying ⟨ηα(t)⟩= 0 and
⟨ηα (t) ηβ (t′)⟩= ζδαβδ (t −t′) with ζ determining the
noise amplitude. Figure 16 shows a numerical solution of
Eq. (61) (panel a) along with the auto-correlation func-
tion of mA (panel d). Such auto-correlation of an observ-
able x is defined here as
Cx (τ) = ⟨x (t) x (t + τ)⟩t
⟨x (t)2⟩t
.
(62)
Note that ⟨x⟩t = 0. If this was not the case, one should
replace x(t) with x(t) −⟨x⟩t in Eq. (62).
As seen in
Figure 16, even though the magnetization performs quite
regular oscillations, its auto-correlation function decays,
thereby indicating that this oscillator eventually forgets
its initial phase [129, 130, 198-207].

17
In many-body systems, however, interactions can over-
come noise, producing coherent oscillations over arbitrar-
ily long periods [94, 95, 97-100, 102, 111-117, 127, 208-
212]. Figure 16 shows that in the 3D nonreciprocal Ising
model, for large system size, temporal correlations of in-
dividual spins σA
i (panel e) and of the total magnetization
MA (panel f) persist and do not decay over large times,
making it a robust clock. This robust clock is an emer-
gent feature of our model which does not rely on any
periodic drive externally imposing a phase.
The different behaviors of the time correlations in the
noisy clock Eq. (61) and in the 3D NR Ising can be re-
spectively compared to spatial density correlations in a
liquid (which decay with distance) and a solid (which is
maintained over arbitrarily large distances). Such com-
parison makes Eq. (61) a "time liquid" and the 3D NR
Ising a "time crystal" which has infinite coherence time.
To substantiate our claim, we find the coherence time
of the swap phase in the 3D NR Ising model by de-
termining the decay rate of the auto-correlation's enve-
lope, ˜CMA(τ). We construct ˜CMA(τ) by interpolating the
peaks of |CMA(τ)|. We then identify the coherence time
τc as the time for which
˜CMA (τc) = exp(−1).
(63)
Figure 17 shows that τc increases with system size as
τc(L) ∼L3 ,
(64)
i.e. linearly with the number of spins, thereby proving
the perfect time-crystal behavior of the 3D NR Ising
in the thermodynamic limit.
A similar scaling for τc
has been observed in a periodically driven 2D system
in Ref. [213].
This result suggests the existence of perfectly coher-
ent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit L →∞,
which can be seen as a breaking of ergodicity [214-
216]. Even at arbitrarily long times, the probability dis-
tribution function P(t) ≡U(t)P0 does not necessarily
converge to a constant stationary distribution P ss such
that U(t)P ss = P ss.
Here, U(t) is the evolution op-
erator acting on probability distributions, e.g. defined
by the master equation (13).
Instead, we expect that
the system evolves towards a limit-cycle PLC satisfying
PLC(t) = PLC(t + Tosc) where Tosc is the oscillation pe-
riod [217]. As a consequence, the distance between the
distributions obtained from evolving two initial condi-
tions P1 and P2 does not necessarily go to zero at long
times, i.e. one can have
lim
t→∞∥U(t)P1 −U(t)P2∦= 0
(65)
because the many-body oscillator remembers its phase
(i.e. its position on the limit cycle), which is encoded in
the probability distribution.
We can combine Eq. (64) with the conjecture of
Ref. [131] to obtain a bound on the minimum rate of
entropy production required to maintain the oscillations.
This conjecture bounds the average entropy per oscil-
lation ∆S by the number of coherent oscillations N ≡
τc/Tosc through the inequality ∆S ≥4π2N. As a conse-
quence, the rate of entropy production per unit volume
˙s ≡
∆S
LdTosc
(66)
must satisfy
˙s ≥4π2
T 2osc
τc(L)
Ld .
(67)
In the stable swap phase Tosc does not depend on L
(it converges to a constant as L →∞, see Fig. 24a in
Sec. IX A). As τc(L) ∼Ld, this bound converges to a
finite value when L →∞, meaning that there is a finite
minimal cost per oscillator to maintain the time-crystal
state. The fit in the inset of Fig. 17b provides τc/Ld for
the example considered in the plot. In Appendix A we
calculate the entropy production explicitly from simula-
tions under the assumption of local detailed balance, and
show that ˙s converges to a finite value and that this value
indeed exceeds the lower bound provided by Eq. (67).
Note that ordered oscillations and infinite coherence
time are not decoupled properties. It is plausible that
a locally coupled system can maintain spatially ordered
oscillations over arbitrarily large distances only if all its
parts adhere to the same prescribed phase determined by
the initial conditions.
C.
The phase transition from disorder to swap in
the high ( ˜J, ˜K) regime
At high ˜J and ˜K values, the transition from disorder to
swap is different than for small ˜J and ˜K values. This is
seen in Fig. 11 where the change in R and L at the phase
transition appears to become more abrupt in the upper
right region, compared to the lower left region. We fur-
ther analyze this transition in Fig. 18. Figure 18a shows
the order parameters as a function of ˜K, for fixed ˜J = 2,
and various system sizes. The plots of R and L vs. ˜K do
not seem to converge to a second-order phase transition
in which the order parameters are continuous. Instead,
an abrupt change in R and L emerges at high system
sizes, suggesting a discontinuity as in first-order phase
transitions.
A clear critical point cannot be identified
since convergence is not reached at L = 320, the largest
linear system size in our simulations (see 0.8 ≲˜K ≲1.1
region in Fig. 18a).
The sharp decrease in synchronization is caused by the
emergence of highly noisy scroll waves that destructs the
order. This is seen in Fig. 18b showing a 2D-slice snap-
shot of θ taken from the 3D simulation.
Scroll waves
are the 3D analog of spiral waves, having line defects
that are typically closed into rings instead of point de-
fects [86, 142, 218, 219] (see also Movie 3 and Fig. 27 in
Sec. X in which the scroll waves are more visible). They

also have spiral cross sections, which is seen in the 2D-cut
θ snapshot in Fig. 18b and in its coarse-grained version,
Fig. 18c (the latter figure makes the defects more appar-
ent by averaging out the noise). We discuss scroll waves
in more detail in Sec. X.
The destruction of the swap phase by scroll waves is
slightly reminiscent of the destruction of order in 2D due
to spiral defects (compare Fig. 9e-f with Fig. 18a), except
that here, it appears that the destruction only occurs for
a limited range of high ˜J and ˜K values.
Due to the
size limitation of our simulations we cannot determine
what portion of the 3D swap phase is destructed by the
scroll waves or what kind of phase transition is associated
with this destruction, although it appears to be first-
order-like (in the sense that the order parameters are
discontinuous).
D.
Why is the swap phase stable in 3D?
Our numerical evidence points to the existence of a sta-
ble swap phase. This relates to a longstanding question:
can time-periodic states of noisy many-body systems
with short-range interactions be stable in the thermo-
dynamic limit [97-100, 102, 111-117, 127, 208-212]. Ref-
erences [99, 100, 102] distinguished two cases, depending
on whether the spontaneously broken time-translation in-
variance is discrete or continuous (Fig. 19a). In systems
that evolve in discrete time as our Monte-Carlo simula-
tion, this depends on the type of oscillations: commen-
surate vs.
incommensurate.
When the period of the
oscillations is commensurate, i.e., a multiple of the dis-
crete time-unite (a case referred to as "periodic k-cycle"),
a discrete time-translation symmetry is broken. In that
case, it was argued in [99] that the growth of out-of-
phase droplets [220] destabilizes long-range ordered os-
cillations.
That is because flat domain walls are ex-
pected to have a non-vanishing velocity, unlike in equi-
librium [221], suggesting that a fluctuation producing a
large enough droplet, can expand rather than shrink. A
similar destabilization mechanism has been observed in
discrete-symmetry flocks [222].
In the incommensurate case, i.e.
when the oscilla-
tion period is not a multiple of the discrete time-unite
(e.g. the time step of the Monte-Carlo simulation), the
discrete-time system is equivalent to continuous-time one
(the discreteness is irrelevant). The oscillatory state then
breaks a continuous time-translation symmetry, which
can be seen by the fact that the oscillation's phase at
a given time can take any value between 0 and 2π. In
continuous symmetry breaking, domain walls smear out
(as in the XY model) and thus the destabilization-by-
droplets argument does not apply [100, 102, 223].
In the nonreciprocal Ising model studied here, the os-
cillation period is incommensurate with the Monte-Carlo
time step. This is seen both in Fig. 19b where a contin-
uous limit cycle is formed in the infinite-time limit, and
in Fig. 19c where the period of the oscillation, measured
as twice the average time between two subsequent sign
flips of MA, is shown to change continuously with the
interaction parameters (a continuously changing number
is in general incommensurate with 1). This means that,
while stable oscillations are not guaranteed, they are not
ruled out by the droplet argument in Ref. [99], see also
Ref. [212]. Figure 19d further exemplifies this: it shows
an analysis of 3D simulations of both the Ising model and
the nonreciprocal Ising model with a flat domain wall in-
troduced at location y = 0 at time t = 0 (the domain
wall separates oppositely magnetizaed states for Ising,
and two swap states at different phases for nonreciprocal

Ising). As time evolves, the domain wall in the nonrecip-
rocal Ising system is shown to widen and dissipate (on
top of slightly moving in the +ˆy direction), unlike the do-
main wall in the Ising system which remain steady. This
suggests that there are no stable domain wall between
oscillating states in the swap phase of the nonreciprocal
Ising model.
The existence of a broken continuous symmetry (time-
translation invariance) suggests a parallel with the
Mermin-Wagner theorem [82, 110] in the time do-
main [91, 109]:
continuous changes in the oscillation
phase over space may behave as generalized Goldstone
modes and their fluctuations preclude order in 2D yet al-
low for order in 3D and beyond. Note that this discussion
disregards any potential phase transition to quasi-long
range order in 2D that would resemble the Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the XY model.
While we have not proven the absence of such a phase
transition in the nonreciprocal Ising model, we do not ex-
pect it to be present. The similarity with the XY model
blurs when we depart from the Hopf bifurcation towards
the high ˜J regime (where one might have hoped to ob-
serve a phase transition to quasi-long range order), since
the discrete symmetry of the spins causes a SNIC bifurca-
tion in mean-field and droplet nucleation in simulations
(Sec. IX). Even the CGL equation with additive noise,
which is rotationally symmetric and hence more related
to the XY model than the NR Ising model, was suggested
to not have a BKT transition [106, 107, 177].
An analogy between (de)synchronization and surface
roughening provides further reasons to expect the swap
phase to be stable in 3D and not in 2D. If we add random
noise to the mean-field equation (30), it takes the form
of a noisy reaction-diffusion system
∂⃗X
∂t = F( ⃗X) + D∇2 ⃗X + noise,
(68)
where ⃗X = x1, .., xn and D can be a matrix. Now assume
that the noiseless and diffusion-less version of Eq. (68)
has a limit cycle in steady state. To test whether the ad-
dition of diffusion and noise allows for synchronized oscil-
lations, we assume that we are deep within the synchro-
nized regime, where fluctuations from the global limit cy-
cle are small and can be treated perturbatively. In this
case, we can focus on the phase variable that describes
the position of the system on the limit cycle, while ne-
glecting other degrees of freedom. This is known as a
phase reduction, see Refs. [85, 224-227]. Under certain
approximations, Eq. (68) can then be mapped to the Kar-
dar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [103]
∂Ψ
∂t = α∇2Ψ + β (∇Ψ)2 + noise
(69)
where the deviation Ψ of the local phase with respect to
the phase of the deterministic limit cycle plays the role
of the surface height in the KPZ equation (Fig. 20), see
Refs. [85, 102, 106, 107, 228]. The KPZ equation predicts
that interfaces are always rough in 2D, but that there is
a phase transition between rough and smooth interfaces
in 3D [229]. This suggests, by analogy, that a spatially
coherent oscillating phase can exist in 3D, but not in 2D.
Note, however, that the variable Ψ in Eq. (69) is an angle
(defined on a compact space, the circle S1), so the results
on the usual KPZ equation cannot be directly applied.
In particular, the fact that the phase Ψ is compact allows
for the existence of topological defects, that may change
the physics. We refer to Refs. [102, 106, 107, 230-232]
for further details on the compact KPZ equation. In 3D,
defect rings are expected to be small (at least for certain
range of ˜J and ˜K) and hence not to completely destroy
long-range order [102].

DESTRUCTION OF THE STATIC-ORDER
PHASE VIA DROPLETS
In finite systems, a ferromagnetic-like state with static
order is observed both in 2D and 3D. As system size in-
creases, however, our numerical simulations indicate that
this static state is destabilized.
This is supported by
Figs. 9e-f and 12a-b (right parts) showing R and L as
a function of ˜J (for a fixed ˜K). The ˜J-transition-point
between static order and oscillations in finite systems (in-
dicated by a sharp change in the slope of R and L becom-
ing zero) increases with system size in a way that does
not seem to converge to a finite ˜J. Figures 12c and 18a
showing R and L as a function of ˜K (for a fixed ˜J) have
a very small region of static order (when ˜K is close to
zero) and it is hard to see what is its fate in the ther-
modynamic limit. However, this region seems to shrink
when L increases in Fig 18a, suggesting a destabilization
of the static-order phase.
The static-order phase is destabilized by nucleation
of droplets that grow and flip the magnetization, in al-
ternating order of A- and B-spins. This mechanism is
demonstrated in Fig. 21, where snapshots of the spins
at different times are shown for increasing system sizes,
in a 2D system. The full evolution is shown in Movie
4. For L = 10 (Fig. 21a), both species do not flip their
magnetization. There are attempts of B-spins to nucle-
ate droplets, but those shrink and disappear. For L = 40
(Fig. 21b), the system is no longer static: a handful of B-
spins droplets (one clearly observed in the figure) surpass
a certain critical droplet size, grow and flip the magne-
tization.
Then, the same occurs for the A-spins, and
so on, leading to an oscillatory behavior of MA(t) and
MB(t), but with intermediate periods in which MA(t)
and MB(t) are constants.
When L = 200 (Fig. 21c),
multiple droplets (≫1) drive the magnetization flipping
of each species, making the MA(t) and MB(t) curves
smooth at all times, i.e, there is no finite period of time
in which the magnetization is constant and the system
could be called static. We note that the figure shows a
2D system but a similar behavior is observed in 3D.
To see why nonreciprocity allows droplets to grow, in
contrast with the equilibrium Ising model where they
tend to shrink, assume first that the system is in the
static-order phase, so most spins in both lattices are up
(Fig. 22a) [96]. We further assume K is very small, which
is when static order is most likely to be stable. As long
as the system is static, it can be mapped into two equi-
librium Ising models with opposite magnetic fields, with
energy

(70)
where H ≈K for A-spins and H ≈−K for B-spins (see
Eq. (11) and Fig. 22b). While sub-system A is in a global
free energy minimum in the effective equilibrium system,
sub-system B is in a metastable state, as it prefers a state
with opposite magnetization. Provided that the system
size is large enough, sub-system B then transitions to its
global minimum by nucleating droplets larger than a crit-
ical size ρc above which the effective magnetic field, which
acts on the volume of the droplet, overcomes the near-
est neighbor attraction, imposing surface tension, which
makes the droplet grow [96, 99, 233, 234] (Fig. 22c). After
a droplet has expanded beyond ρc, the stable sub-system
becomes metastable and nucleates droplets, and so on
(Fig. 22d). Crucially, due to the symmetry between A
and B spins, both droplet types expand with the same
speed. Therefore, a nested droplet remains much smaller
than its "mother-droplet" until the latter reaches the sys-
tem size or collides with other droplets (see Sec. XII in
which this symmetry is absent). A simplified view of this

all spins located at y > L/2. System parameters are: ˜J = 1.4 (Ising) and ˜J = 1.5, ˜K = 0.1 (NR Ising), and L = 320. i and

mechanism can be found in defining a "selfish free en-
ergy" for the zero-dimensional mean-field equation, see
Appendix E.
The argument sketched above relies on ρc being finite,
which is the case in any finite dimension (and finite cou-
plings ˜J and ˜K) because the volume term ultimately
dominates at sufficiently large droplet sizes. Hence, we
conjecture that in the fully anti-symmetric nonrecipro-

cal Ising model, the static-order phase is unstable in the
thermodynamic limit in any finite dimension.
A.
Between static order and swap: the droplet
regime
The droplet mechanism explained above means that
as system size increases, a regime of droplet-induced
swap develops instead of the static-order phase. In 2D,
this regime separates static-order from disorder, while in
3D, it separates static-order from the noisy homogeneous
swap regime.
In the droplet-induced swap regime, the critical droplet
size increases as ˜J increases (and as ˜K decreases). As a
result, the droplets become more sparse and the distance
they travel before colliding with each other increases.
Eventually, ˜J becomes large enough (or ˜K small enough)
that the critical droplet size becomes larger than the sys-
tem size. In that case, the magnetization can flip when
fluctuations are of the order of the system size, in the
same way as in the usual equilibrium Ising model.
This is demonstrated in Fig. 23 where 2D-slice snap-
shots of the θ field, as well as the magnetizations of the
two species as a function of time, are shown for a 3D
system with linear size L = 80 at increasing values of
˜J (and decreasing values of ˜K). For small ˜J (high ˜K),
the 3D system is in a noisy homogeneous swap phase.
There are no apparent droplets but rather noisy patterns
without a well-defined shape (Fig. 23a,e).
Put differ-
ently, independent fluctuations do not have time to ex-
pand significantly before colliding. For larger ˜J (smaller
˜K) values we observe droplets that drive the magnetiza-
tion flips (Fig. 23b-c,f-g). For an even larger ˜J (smaller
˜K), no droplets are observed and the magnetizations do
not change over a long period of time (Fig. 23d,h).
The droplet regime is characterized by a distinct be-
havior of the oscillation period, Tosc, as a function of
system size. In Fig. 24a, the oscillation period in 3D is
shown as a function of ˜J with a fixed ˜K, for increasing
L values. In the non-droplet regime, i.e. small ˜J, Tosc
is independent of system size (note that the period is
finite at the critical point ˜Jc, supporting a Hopf-like be-
havior), while in the droplet-induced swap regime (large
˜J) Tosc decreases with system size at intermediate L but
converges in the L →∞limit to a finite value, inde-
pendent of L (see overlap of orange and green lines in
Fig. 24a up to ˜J ≈2.3). At larger ˜J values, in a finite
system, droplets are so rare that each magnetization flip
is driven by a single droplet (here we assume that ˜J is
not too large, such that the critical droplet size is still
smaller than the system size). In this regime, the single
droplet can emerge in any lattice position at a given time
step, thus Tosc scales with L−3 [96, 233], see Fig. 24b.
The different oscillation regimes share similarities with
the relaxation of the magnetization in an Ising model
from an initial state magnetized opposite to the applied
field H. Reference [233] identifies four regimes, depend-
ing on the field strength and system size. The "strong-
field" regime in which "the droplet picture is inappro-
priate", and three other regimes which are classified us-
ing droplet theory by the relation between three length
scales: the critical droplet radius ρc, the mean droplet
separation ρ0, and the linear system size L. These are
the multi-droplet regime L ≫ρ0 ≫ρc, the single-droplet
regime ρ0 ≫L ≫ρc, and the "coexistence region"
ρ0 ≫ρc ≫L where the system behaves as if there is
no applied field. The average metastable lifetime calcu-
lated in Ref. [233] is shown to be independent of system
size in strong field and multi-droplet regime yet highly
dependent on system size in the single-droplet and coex-
istence regime, in a way reminiscent of Fig. 24a. We note
that the analogy drawn here is not perfect because non-
reciprocal interactions are different from an externally
applied field in that they change once the magnetization
flips.
B.
The fate of the droplet regime
We now discuss the fate of the droplet-induced swap
regime in the thermodynamic limit. In 2D, this regime
is destabilized by spiral defects making it disordered, as
was shown in Sec. VII.
In 3D, the scenario is more complex. While droplets
persist at large system size, distant regions become less
synchronized and the system loses its global order. This
is illustrated in Fig. 25 which shows snapshots of the θ
field, taken from simulations in the droplet-induced swap
regime, with different system sizes. In Fig. 25, we see that
at system sizes L = (80, 160, 320) there are regions with
n = (2, 3, 4) distinct θ-valued (i.e. n different colors in
the plot), respectively. This decreases the synchroniza-

tion. Indeed, the synchronization order parameter, R, is
shown to decrease with L, in the right part of Fig. 12a,
corresponding to the droplet-induced swap region. While
R decreases with system size, it does not converge. Thus,
it is unclear to what extent order is lost in the thermody-
namic limit, and whether it remains finite or is ultimately
deemed disordered (R = 0). If the latter is correct, it
remains an open question what is the type of phase tran-
sition that occurs and where lies the critical line between
swap and disorder in this droplet regime.
The decrease in order in the droplet-induced-swap
regime causes an intriguing behavior, observed only for
large system size, (L ≥160): synchronization is non-
monotonic as a function of ˜J (or ˜K). See L = 320 line
in Fig. 12a, where R increases monotonically with ˜J be-
yond the Hopf bifurcation until ˜J ∼2.05, and then starts
decreasing. It then reaches a local minimum at ˜J ∼2.25
and increases again until saturation at ˜J ∼2.55. A sim-
ilar behavior is observed in the left part Fig. 18a, for
L = 320, where R is non-monotonic as a function of ˜K.
In both cases the anomalous decrease starts when the
swap phase transitions from noisy homogeneous swap to
droplet-induced swap.
The mechanism under which global synchronization
decreases with increased
˜J (or decreased
˜K) in the
droplet regime is shown in Fig. 26, which compares two
simulations with the same ˜K = 0.3 value: one at the
onset of droplet-induced swap ( ˜J = 2.04), and the other
well within the droplet-induced swap ( ˜J = 2.24). Simula-
tion snapshots (Figure 26a) reveal that while the system
is more correlated over short distances at larger ˜J values,
it loses global order due to large regions that are out-of-
phase with the rest of the system. This can be quantified
by a size-dependent synchronization parameter,

large l, R(l) is larger for the system with the lower ˜J.
Moreover, while R(l) at low ˜J decays exponentially with
l, in the high ˜J regime it does not and the second deriva-
tive of R(l) changes signs. This means that within the
droplet-induced swap regime, the system cannot be de-
scribed by a single correlation length, and instead has
multiple length scales related to the droplet parameters
such as the critical droplet size, the typical distance be-
tween droplets, and the correlation length inside a single
droplet.

COARSENING DYNAMICS: SCROLL
WAVES AND PLANAR WAVES
We now qualitatively discuss the way in which the sys-
tem coarsens into an ordered state in 3D. In the sim-
ulations used to calculate the order parameters R and
L (Figs. 11, 12 and 18), the spins were initialized in an
ordered initial condition (all spins up), making the tran-
sition to steady state in the swap and static-order phases
relatively fast. When fully disordered initial conditions
are used (each spin is set to +1 or −1 randomly), how-
ever, the system can coarsen into long-lived metastable
states, before reaching steady state. To show this, we
present in Fig. 27a the same plot as Fig. 12a (R vs.
˜J
in 3D) but with random initial conditions, and average
taken over a single simulation running for a very long
time. In both the swap phase (1.4 ≲˜J ≲2.3) and static-
order phase ( ˜J ≳2.3) we see that for some of the realiza-
tions the system reaches the same steady state as with
ordered initialization (shown in semi-transparent lines).
However, sometimes the measured R is much lower than
the one obtained with ordered initialization, suggesting
that the system got trapped in a metastable state.
The states in which the system gets trapped in are
scroll waves and planar waves, shown in Fig. 27b-d and
Movie 3 in both 3D snapshots and 2D-slice snapshots.
Here the scroll waves are much less noisy than those dis-
cussed in Sec. VIII C.
The planar waves in the nonreciprocal Ising model
are analogous to what happens in the equilibrium Ising
model, in which the system often reaches stripes or min-
imal surfaces in the final stages of the coarsening dy-
namics [234, 235].
Here, however, the stripes move in
a particular direction that guarantees, for each site, the
↑↑→↑↓→↓↓→↓↑→↑↑cycle on average.
A planar wave
state breaks both time translation symmetry and space
translation symmetry (in one direction).
The coarsening dynamics is most easily understood
by following the defect filaments of the scroll waves
(Fig. 27e).
The defects are found using the size-
dependent synchronization parameter, s(l), defined in
Eq. (71). Note that s(l) is 1 if all the sites in the box
are identical, and it is close to zero if the box has a mix-
ture of sites in all four possible states. Thus, we classify
defects as sites on the coarse-grained grid in which s(l)
is smaller than a threshold smax.
The box size l and
the s-threshold are fine-tuned to detect the defect fila-
ments while filtering out noise (l = 3 and smax = 0.2 in
Fig. 27e).
In the example shown in Fig. 27e, the system coarsens
into a complex mixture of defect lines shortly after initial-
ization with disordered initial conditions. After a while,
only two defect lines survive. The lines are connected
onto themselves by virtue of the periodic boundary con-
ditions, having the topology of rings on a 3-dimensional
torus with opposite winding numbers (1 and −1). Thus,
they cannot shrink by themselves to a point.
Finally,
the two filaments collide, forming a new ring with zero
winding number that shrinks and disappears. The sys-
tem then stays in a planar waves state for a very long
time.
Movie 3 shows another example of the filament
dynamics that ends in a defect-free swap phase.
The occurrences in which the system escapes scroll-
waves state into swap or static order, without any ob-
servation of transitions from the swap or static-order
phase into scroll waves, suggest that these are metastable
states. This is not the case, however, in the high ˜K limit,
where the scroll waves appear to be stable, as explained
in Sec. VIII C.

SCHEMATIC PHASE DIAGRAM IN THE
FULLY ANTI-SYMMETRIC CASE
The results from Secs. VII, VIII, and IX enable us to
construct a schematic phase diagram in both 2D and 3D
for the fully anti-symmetric case.
In 2D, our numerical results suggest that both the swap
phase and the static-order phase are unstable, as long as
K ̸= 0. This leads to the conclusion that there is a single
stable phase in the thermodynamic limit: disorder (see
Fig. 28a). The same conclusion applies to the 1D case,
as is shown in Appendix B.
In 3D (see Fig. 28b), our numerical results suggest that
static order is unstable but that the swap phase is stable,
with a second-order-like phase transition from disorder to
swap featuring 3D XY critical exponents. Regions with
high ˜J or ˜K have not been revealed in full: in the large
˜J limit, synchronization decreases, possibly to zero, due
to the difficulty of droplet-induced swap to synchronize.
In the high ˜K regime, scroll waves completely destabi-
lize the long-range order. Both mechanisms are capable
of destroying a large portion of the stable swap phase
regime, and there is also a possibility that they would
meet in the high ˜J and high ˜K regime, leading to a com-
pact swap phase in ( ˜J, ˜K) space rather than an infinite
one. Due to the limitations of our simulations, these in-
teresting possibilities lie beyond the scope of this work,
which has focused mostly on the low ˜J and ˜K regime,
where the swap phase appears to be stable and critical
exponents can be calculated.
XII.
GENERAL ASYMMETRIC COUPLINGS
In the previous sections, we have focused on the fully
anti-symmetric case where K+ = 0 in Eq. (12), for which
our model has a C4 symmetry. In this section, we test
whether our results rely on this additional symmetry by
considering K+ ̸= 0, for which the symmetry is reduced
to the diagonal Z2 described in Eq. (24).

Mean-field analysis

when both ˜K+ and ˜K−are assumed to be positive),
Fig. 29a, the system is disordered when ˜J < 1, and un-
dergoes a Hopf bifurcation at ˜J = 1, transitioning from
disorder to a limit cycle. Unlike the K+ = 0 case studied
throughout most of the paper, here the limit cycle is not
rotationally-symmetric even in the ˜J −1 ≪1 limit. This
is seen when writing the spatially homogeneous mean-
field equation in polar coordinates,

(74)
The leading order term in r is θ-dependent, and does not
simply scale with ˜J −1. Hence, a separation between the
time scales of r and θ cannot be invoked as in Sec. V B.
Instead, the limit cycle is elliptical near the Hopf bifur-
cation [85].
Increasing ˜J leads to additional bifurcations. First, a
(Z2-symmetric) SNIC bifurcation where the limit cycle
is destroyed by the emergence of two (rather than four
for the K+ = 0 case) pairs of stable and saddle points.
The stable points that emerge lie in the first and third
quadrants of the (mA, mB) plane, corresponding to states
where the two species are aligned. Then, for even larger
values of ˜J, a saddle-node bifurcation occurs where two
additional pairs of stable and saddle points emerge, yet
static order is maintained.
The new stable points lie
in the second and fourth quadrants, representing anti-
aligned states.
This behavior is observed for ˜K+ and
˜K−much smaller than 1 (0.1 and 0.2 respectively in the
Fig. 29). For larger values, a saddle-node bifurcation can
occur such that the ferromagnetic phase coexists with the
limit cycle (this scenario is explored in Ref. [151]).

fork bifurcation occurs where two saddle points emerge
from the origin (0, 0), which transitions from a saddle
to an unstable point. As ˜J increases further, a saddle-
node bifurcation occurs where two pairs of anti-aligned
stable and saddle points appear. These two additional
bifurcations maintain the system in a static-order phase.
In the ˜K2
+ −˜K2
−> 1 case (Fig. 29c), the bifurcations
are the same as in the 0 ≤˜K2
+ −˜K2
−< 1 case, except
that there are already two stable fixed points at ˜J = 0.
As a result, the system remains in the static-order phase
for any value of ˜J (although ˜J must greater than zero for
coarse-graining to take place). The absence of oscillations
for ˜K+ > ˜K−arises because, despite having nonrecipro-
cal interactions, the two species "agree" on whether they
prefer to align or anti-align. This makes a magnetization
flip unfavorable for either species.
Figure 30 shows a slice through the three-dimensional
phase diagram (which depends on ˜J, ˜K+, and , ˜K−), with
˜K+ fixed at 0.3. The main difference between this phase
diagram and the one in Fig. 4 (which shows the ˜K+ =
0 case) is the pitchfork bifurcation line separating the
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases in the ˜K−≤˜K+
region, which is just a point in Fig. 4.
B.
Swap phase
We perform Monte-Carlo simulations in both 2D and
3D for the general asymmetric case, i.e.
with the in-
clusion of reciprocal inter-species interactions. In 2D, we
find that the swap phase is unstable, as in the case of fully
anti-symmetric interactions (Sec. VII). This is shown in
Fig. 31 in which R and L are plotted as a function of
˜J with fixed ˜K+ and ˜K−(a-b) and as a function of ˜K+
with fixed ˜J and ˜K−(c-d). In the region in which L ̸= 0
(indicating the swap phase), both R and L decrease with
system size. Furthermore, in appendix F we show color
maps of R and L as a function of ˜J and ˜K−with a fixed
non-zero value of ˜K+. These color maps show that, sim-
ilarly to the ˜K+ = 0 case shown in Fig. 9a-d, R and L
diminish as system size increases in the swap regime.
The destabilized phase is shown to be contaminated
with defects (inset in Fig 31), but it does not seem to
support spiral waves. This seems to result from the lack
of symmetry between the four two-spin states, which is
required for the stability of a spiral waves: since A-spins
want to align with B-spins more than B-spins wish to
anti-align with A spins, ↑↑and ↓↓states are more fa-
vorable than ↑↓and ↓↑, and thus the four "arms" sur-
rounding a defect move at different velocities, destroying
the potential spiral configuration. Instead of spirals we
observe a complex behavior in which large homogeneous
regions of either ↑↑or ↓↓state continuously move and de-
form, while defects are rapidly created and annihilated at
the boundaries between them.
In 3D, Monte-Carlo simulations suggest that a stable
swap phase still exists, even when reciprocal interactions
are added. Figure 32 shows color maps of R and L for
a fixed ˜K+ and L = 80. A region with non-zero R and
L, corresponding to a swap phase, is observed. Figure 33
then analyzes a line cut through the color maps for a
fixed value of ˜K−. As ˜J is varied, a continuous phase
transition from disorder to swap is observed (at ˜J ≈1.45)
and becomes more sharp as L increases. The swap phase
is stable for ˜J ≲1.7 but destabilizes at higher values, as
is discussed next.
To conclude, the instability of the swap phase in 2D
and its stability in 3D are not limited to the case of fully
anti-symmetric interactions in which ˜K+ = 0, but ex-
tends to the general asymmetric case.

C.
Stability of the static-order phase: a
droplet-capture mechanism
While the fate of the swap phase is robust to the addi-
tion of reciprocal inter-species interactions, our Monte-
Carlo simulations suggest this is not the case for the
static-order phase.
First, let us examine the right part of each panel of
Fig. 31, showing the transition to static order (R ̸= 0
and L ≈0) for a finite-size system in 2D. Figure 31a-b
shows that the ˜J-transition-point between the unstable
swap regime and static order increases with system size
and it is hard to conclude whether static order is stable
in the thermodynamic limit. In Fig. 31c-d, where ˜K+
is varied, R seems to converge to finite non-zero values
(while L approaches zero) for ˜K+ ≳0.24, which might
indicate a stable phase transition from disorder to static
order.
Surprisingly, the supposed phase transition oc-
curs even though ˜K+ is lower than ˜K−( ˜K−= 0.3),
which is the case where one species favors alignment while
the other favors anti-alignment. In 3D, Fig. 33 gives an
even stronger indication that there is a well-defined phase
transition from disorder to static order: for linear system
sizes L = 40, 80, 160, there is an abrupt transition from a
region in which R and L approach zero (see 1.8 ≲˜J ≲2.2
in Fig. 33) to a regime in which R is finite and L →0
( ˜J ≳2.2 in Fig. 33), and the transition seems to converge
at ˜J ≈2.2. Again, the transition occurs when ˜K+ < ˜K−
( ˜K+ = 0.1 while ˜K−= 0.3).
These indications raise
the question: does the droplet destabilization argument
sketched in Sec. IX for the fully anti-symmetric case ap-
ply here?
Let us assume again a static-order scenario in which
both spin species are up on average. The species favoring
anti-alignment (B) prefers a state in which all of its spins
are flipped. As a result, it will nucleate droplets with
opposite magnetization. As in the fully anti-symmetric
case, we expect that once these droplets will surpass a
critical size, they will expand instead of shrinking. After
certain amount of time, the same event will repeat itself
for the A species: a critical droplet will nucleate and
expand.
However, because of the asymmetry between the two
species imposed by K+, the critical droplet size ρc and

simulations whether the system is in the swap or disordered
phase.
more importantly the velocity in which droplets expand
v(ρ), is different for A-droplets and B-droplets.
Here,
A-spins interact more strongly with B-spins than the
other way around, leading to smaller ρc and larger v(ρ)
for A-droplets [233].
As a result, a nested A-droplet
inside a B-droplet will expand more quickly and may
eventually reach the boundaries of the B-droplet. Once
this happens, our simulations show that the B-droplet
can disintegrate, and the magnetization flip it prevented.
Movie 5 shows a 2D simulation in which this mechanism
takes place. Snapshots from the simulation are shown in
Fig. 34. Note that the simulation parameters were cho-
sen to enhance the visibility of the mechanism, allowing
the B-droplet to persist for an extended period, but the
mechanism is expected to be more efficient in suppress-
ing droplet growth as the asymmetry between the species
increases (larger K+).
To summarize, when inter-species interactions have
opposite signs (the ˜K+ < ˜K−case) but are not fully
anti-symmetric, there is a competing mechanism that
prevents droplets from growing.
This suggests a re-
stabilization of the static-order phase in the general
asymmetric case, for d ≥2.
D.
Absence of infinite-period phase transition
In the fully anti-symmetric case (K+ = 0), there is an
oscillating (swap) phase in 3D, but there is no static-order
phase. As a consequence, there is no infinite-period phase
transition that would correspond to the SNIC bifurcation
observed in the mean-field dynamics. A similar situation
has been described in Ref. [96].
In the general asym-
metric case, however, both the swap phase and static-
order phase exist in 3D. Nevertheless, we did not observe
any direct phase transition between the two. Figures 32
and 33 show that the transition between them, when ˜K+
is fixed and ˜J and ˜K are varied, is mediated by an inter-
mediate disordered region. Unlike the 3D droplet regime
with fully anti-symmetric interactions whose fate is left
undetermined (Sec. IX B), here the intermediate regime
shows convergence to a state with R = 0, i.e., disorder. A
snapshot of θ of a 2D slice in the intermediate disordered
regime is shown in the inset in Fig. 33a. Large regions of
aligned spins, either in ↑↑or ↓↓state, coexist with some
defects on the boundaries between them, similar to the
2D disorder discussed in Sec. XII B. In Appendix G, the
order parameters on additional cuts through the phase
diagram are shown (one with a fixed value of ˜J and an-
other with a fixed value of ˜K−). These cuts support the
same conclusion: the transition between swap to static
order we observed is mediated by disorder.
E.
Schematic phase diagram in the general
asymmetric case
A schematic drawing of the 2D and 3D phase diagram
with a fixed non-zero ˜K+ is shown in Fig. 35. In 2D,
our numerical results suggest that there are stable dis-
order and static-order phases (but no swap), while in
3D, our numerical results suggest that all the phases
predicted by mean-field: disorder, swap, and static or-
der, are stable. We expect the disorder-to-swap phase
transition to be characterized by the same critical expo-
nents as in Sec. VIII A (compatible with 3D XY), at least
throughout a portion of the phase transition line. Other
portions may be described by first-order-like phase tran-
sitions. Similarly, we hypothesize that the phase transi-
tion from disorder to static order in both 2D and 3D has
Ising critical exponents in the regime where K+ > K−,
but might be first-order-like in the opposite K+ < K−
regime (see Fig. 32a in which the K+ < K−phase tran-
sition seems more abrupt than the K+ > K−phase tran-
sition). Finally, we cannot exclude that the three phases
in 3D meet at a tricritical point (or line in the three-
dimensional phase diagram).

CONCLUSIONS
We introduced a nonreciprocal Ising model as a min-
imal model for nonreciprocal many-body dynamics, and
studied the stability of its static and time-dependent
phases along with the transitions between them.
Our
main result is the stability of a time-dependent (swap)
phase in 3D, which behaves as a time-crystal with in-
finite coherence time in the thermodynamic limit. The
phase transition from disorder to swap is characterized
by critical exponents compatible with the 3D XY model,
which can be rationalized by the breaking of a continu-

ous symmetry (time translation) in the swap phase. The
existence of a swap phase in 3D is robust and holds for
fully anti-symmetric interactions between the species as
well as the more general asymmetric interactions case.
Based on simulations and theoretical arguments, we
predict that the static-order (ferromagnetic) phase is un-
stable in any finite dimension for fully anti-symmetric
interactions. The instability is caused by the expansion
of droplets of opposite magnetization occurring in the
metastable species. When the inter-species interaction
is not fully anti-symmetric, a competing mechanism of
droplet-capture by the other species can re-stabilize the
static-order phase. A direct phase transition between a
time-dependent phase and a static-ordered phase, how-
ever, was not observed.

Appendix A: Measurements of time-reversal
symmetry breaking
As shown in Sec. IV B, nonreciprocal coupling breaks
detailed balance, and therefore time-reversal symmetry.
This is a statement about the dynamics of our system.
The dynamics can be related to thermodynamic observ-
ables - such as heat, work, and entropy - under the lo-
cal detailed balance condition [156-158, 236-238]. As we
don't explicitly model the environment of our system, the
local detailed balance condition is a hypothesis. Specifi-
cally, local detailed balance relates the entropy produced
by a state transition (here, a spin flip) to the transition
rates w(F α
i ⃗σ|⃗σ) via
∆Ssingle flip = ln w (F α
i ⃗σ|⃗σ)
w (⃗σ|F α
i ⃗σ).
(A1)
Here entropy is given in units of kB. By summing over a
series of transitions in a specified trajectory, the above ex-
pression gives the total entropy produced by that trajec-
tory. For example, Eq. (17) gives the entropy produced
by a specific cycle of spin states.
To characterize the steady states of the system, it is
more convenient to measure the average entropy produc-
tion rate. This is given by (see §6.2.2 of [156] for deriva-

The entropy production rate in Eq. (A3) is a micro-
scopic measurement of time-reversal symmetry breaking.
By contrast, the phase space angular momentum L =
⟨MB∂tMA −MA∂tMB⟩t,Ωintroduced in Eq. (51) of the
main text is a macroscopic measurement of time-reversal
symmetry breaking.
Coarse-graining from micro- to
macroscopic variables is known to give a lower bound
to the true entropy production rate [156], below we will
show that L is proportional to the coarse-grained (meso-
scopic) entropy production rate, denoted by ˙S, only for
cases where the fluctuations in magnetization are negligi-
ble compared with the average magnetization and if one
considers the dynamics of the mean-field equation with
added noise in the mα ≪1 limit.
To see this, we work with the mean-field equation of
the fully anti-symmetric case expanded around mα ≪1,
Eq. (30), as a stochastic PDE with white noise,

system size, a nested droplet of A-spins nucleates and expands
at faster speed, eventually catching up with the boundaries of
the B-droplet, making it shrink and disappear. This mecha-
nism can stabilize the static-order phase when ˜K+ < ˜K−.

In conclusion, L ∝
˙S for a mesoscale system obeying
Eq. (A4) if (i) |mα| ≪1 and (ii) δmα(⃗r) ≪Mα. Un-
der these two approximations, and in the vicinity of the

34
Hopf bifurcation, Eq. (A4) can be reduced into the noisy
Stuart-Landau equation [85]
dM
dt
= (a −b|M|2)M + H
(A15)
where M = MA + iMB, H = ηA + iηB, and a and
b are complex coefficients.
Writing the Stuart-Landau
equation in polar coordinates and eliminating the ra-
dial equation yields a drift-diffusion equation that sat-
urates the bound on the entropy production per oscilla-
tion ∆S ≥4π2N of Ref. [131] mentioned in Sec. VIII B
(here, N ≡τc/Tosc where τc is the coherence time and
Tosc is the period of oscillation). Indeed, it is shown in
Ref. [245, SM § III] that in this case, the rate of en-
tropy production is ˙S = f 2τc in which f = 2π/Tosc, and
∆S = Tosc ˙S saturates the bound. We refer to Ref. [245]
for more details.
While L can be measured in any state, in general one
will have L ̸= ˙S, and no conclusion about entropy pro-
duction in terms of phase space angular momentum can
be made.
We calculate the entropy production rate per spin in
the 3D NR Ising model using MC simulations. Figure 36
shows ˙s for L = 40 and L = 80, as a function of the
coupling ˜J. The curves overlap, which shows that ˙s is
independent of system size for large systems. ˙s decreases
monotonically with ˜J, as stronger nearest-neighbor cou-
pling slows down the cycle rate of individual spin-pairs.
By contrast, L is non-zero only in the swap phase. For
˜J = 1.6 and
˜K = 0.1, we compare ˙s to the lower-
bound given by the temporal autocorrelation function
in Eq. (67), where Tosc is found by measuring the aver-
age oscillation time and τc is given by the fit in Fig. 17.
Indeed, ˙s exceeds the lower bound by a factor of about
10.
Appendix B: 1D NR Ising model
We simulate the one-dimensional NR Ising model, with
fully anti-symmetric interactions, using random picking
Glauber dynamics as in the 2D simulations (see Sec. VI).
The order parameters R and L as a function of ˜J and for
fixed ˜K are shown in Fig. 37a and Fig. 37b, respectively,
while kymographs of θ with different ˜J and ˜K values are
shown in Fig. 37c.
The 1D NR Ising model does not have a phase tran-
sition to an ordered state (either static or time depen-
dent), as is evident from the decrease of R and L as sys-
tem size increases. Similarly to the 1D Ising model, as
L increases, domains of opposite magnetization emerge
and the system becomes disordered.
However, unlike
the Ising model, the boundaries between the domains do
not diffuse but move with non-zero velocity (see Fig. 37c
where the kymograph slope indicates the velocity). Do-
mains expand in a way that can be viewed as the 1D
version of droplet growth discussed in Sec. IX.

Appendix C: The effect of different update rules
Out of equilibrium, different update rules may change
the steady state of the system. To study this effect in the
NR Ising model, we performed simulations with random
sequential updates, checkerboard updates [173], and syn-
chronous updates (in which all the spins are updated at
the same time) [246]. Additionally, we used the Metropo-
lis algorithm [186] and compared it to the Glauber which
was used throughout the paper.
For fixed coupling parameters ( ˜J and ˜K), the differ-
ent update rules changed the dynamics in steady state.
However, they did not lead to qualitative changes in the
phase diagram. That way, the critical point ˜Jc, for some
fixed ˜K, is altered, but not the existence / destabiliza-
tion of a phase transition. As an example, we show in
Fig. 38 that the phase transition from disorder to swap in
3D, as characterized by the variation of the order param-
eter R as a function of ˜J, is qualitatively the same when
using random sequential updates (standard Glauber al-
gorithm), as it is with the checkerboard algorithm, which
was used to produced Fig. 12a.
We did not find any qualitative difference related to
phase transitions.
The only notable difference is that
with synchronous updates, fluctuations were consider-
ably larger due to "checkerboard patterns" (small re-
gions in which each spin is anti-aligned with its same-
species neighbors) that frequently appeared and then dis-
appeared.

Appendix D: Simulations of the mean-field equation

We simulate the full mean-field equation on a grid
(Eq. (21)) in 2D in the fully anti-symmetric case and
in the regime corresponding to a stable swap phase (see
Fig. 4). Results are shown in Fig. 39. Depending on ini-
tial conditions, the system can end up in different states.

where the θ field changes periodically and homogeneously
(Fig. 39, first row), while an initially fully disordered
state (mA and mB are chosen randomly at each point to
be either +0.1 or −0.1) reaches a stable state with spi-
ral defects, whose cores barely move over time (Fig. 39,
second row).

equation by writing,

Above some critical
ζ, and for fixed system size, we observed that even when
the system is initialized in an ordered state, spiral de-
fects eventually form over time. (see Fig. 39, third row).
Moreover, they are qualitatively similar to those ob-
served when random initial conditions are implemented
(Fig. 39, fourth row). In that sense, the mean-field equa-
tion with noise exhibits the same qualitative behavior as
the Monte-Carlo simulations, where the swap phase is
unstable in 2D.

noise, the swap phase is unstable even with ordered initial conditions and spiral defects are formed for both initialization
types. Simulations were performed using the Euler-Maruyama method with a time step ∆t = 0.05. Noise amplitude for the
case of added noise is ζ = 0.36, and other system parameters are:
˜J = 2, ˜K = 0.8, L = 200, and τ = 1. At t = 0, we set
mA, mB = 1 ± 0.1 for ordered initial conditions and mA, mB = ±0.1 for disordered initial conditions, where the plus/minus
sign is chosen at random for each spin. Kymographs show evolution between t = 9900 and t = 10000.

Equation (E3) can be viewed as the free-energy landscape
that each species "sees", where the free-energy landscape
of A changes with mB and vice versa.
We now restrict ourselves to the zero-dimensional case,
where the selfish free energies become the functions

In order to visualize the free-energy landscape of each
species at a given state, we solve the spatially homoge-
neous mean-field equation (Eq. (30)) and substitute the
mB(t) solution into FA and the mA(t) solution into FB.
Snapshots of the steady-state free-energy landscape are
shown in Fig. 40, for the disordered, swap, and static-
order phases. The actual values of mA and mB in steady
state are shown as disks moving on the free-energy land-
scape.
In the disordered phase (Fig. 40a), both mA and mB
are in the global minimum of their respective free en-
ergies.
In the swap phase (Fig. 40b), the free-energy
landscape of each species changes continuously. While
one species is momentarily in a global minimum, the
other species is descending along the free-energy land-
scape which changes the free-energy landscape of the first
species and so on. In the static-order phase (Fig. 40c),
one of the species is at its global minimum while the sec-
ond is in a local minimum, that is not the global one.
This configuration is stable in mean-field, but once noise
is introduced, it becomes metastable: the second species
will "jump" over the barrier and reach global minimum,
making the first species metastable and the cycle repeats
itself. In a spatially extended system, this transition hap-
pens via droplet nucleation and growth as depicted in
Sec. IX.
Appendix F: Color maps of the order parameters in
2D in the general asymmetric case
Figure 41 shows color maps of R and L as a function
of ˜J and ˜K−with a fixed non-zero value of ˜K+, for a
2D system with L = 20 (panels a-b) and L = 80 (panels
c-d). For L = 20 the phase diagram resembles the mean-
field prediction (Fig. 30), which includes a swap phase.
However, for L = 80 both R and L diminish and there
is no apparent swap phase, supporting the conclusions of
Sec. XII B.
Appendix G: Color maps of the order parameters in
3D in the general asymmetric case
In the general asymmetric case, the phase diagram is
three-dimensional as it depends on ˜J, ˜K+, and ˜K−. In
the main text the order parameters of the 3D system

were calculated from MC simulations as a function of ˜J
and ˜K−for a fixed value of ˜K+ (Fig. 32).
Figure 42
shows the order parameters on additional cuts through
the three-dimensional phase diagram, both for a fixed
value of ˜J and for a fixed value of ˜K−, for a 3D system
of linear size L = 80. In both cuts, the three phases of
disorder (R = 0 and L = 0), swap (R ̸= 0 and L ̸= 0)
and static-order (R ̸= 0 and L = 0) are visible. However,
the transition between the swap phase and the static-
order phase is mediated by a disordered phase, as was
also pointed out in Sec. XII D. The only region where a
direct transition appears to occur is in the ˜K+ →0 limit,
see the bottom-left part of Fig. 42a-b and the upper-left
part of Fig. 42c-d. However, in this case, the static-order
phase is predicted to be unstable due to droplet growth as
discussed in Sec. IX, and therefore this direct transition
is only observed in finite systems.
Appendix H: Supplementary movies

tions to disorder caused by spiral defects. Obtained from
MC simulations with parameters: L = 150, ˜J = 2.8, and

[93] References [89, 90] conjecture that quasi-long-range may
be present at d = 2, but more recent studies based on a
mapping to a version of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
equation with compact variables suggest that the phase
with algebraic order does not persist in the limit of large
systems (nor an equivalent of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-
Thouless (BKT) transition) but are replaced with a
stretched exponential decay of correlations correspond-
ing to the rough phase of the KPZ equation [106, 107].
In addition, Refs. [177] argue that the modified effective
interaction between spiral defects (compared to that be-
tween XY vortices) allows for a finite density of defects
at any temperature, potentially suppressing the alge-
braic order.

[128] This can be seen by integrating dϕt = ωdt +
p
2DϕdWt
where Wt is a standard Wiener process, leading to ϕ(t)−
ϕ(0) = ωt +
p
2DϕWt. We find C(t) = eiωt⟨ei√
2DϕWt⟩.
As Wt follows a normal distribution N(µ = 0, σ2 = t),
its moment generating function is MWt(x) ≡E(exWt) =
eµx+σ2x2/2 from which the result is found.

[220] Note that these potential droplets are not the droplets
that destabilize the static-order phase (as in Fig. 21).
Instead, these are droplets of a homogeneously oscillat-
ing state, immersed in an oscillatory background with a
different phase.
