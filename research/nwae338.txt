ABSTRACT 
Probabilistic computing has emerged as a viable approach to treat optimization problems. To achieve 
superior computing performance, the key aspect during computation is massive sampling and tuning on the 
probability states of each probabilistic bit (p-bit), demanding its high stability under extensive operations. 
Here, we demonstrate a p-bit constructed by a manganite nanowire that shows exceptionally high stability. 
The p-bit contains an electronic domain that fluctuates between metallic (low-resistance) and insulating 
(high-resistance) states near its transition temperature. The probability for the two states can be directly 
controlled by nano-ampere electrical current. Under extensive operations, the standard error of its 
probability values is < 1.3%. Simulations show that our operationally stable p-bit plays a key role in 
achieving correct inference in a Bayesian network by strongly suppressing the relative error, displaying the 
potential for superior computing performance. Our p-bit also serves as a high-quality random number 
generator without extra data-processing, beneficial for cryptographic applications.

INTRODUCTION 
Exploring the stochastic dynamics in nanomaterials 
has shown to be important in the emerging field of 
probabilistic computing, a new paradigm beyond 
conventional Von-Neumann architectures aiming to 
solve problems such as combinatorial optimization, 
invertible logic, and Bayesian inference [1 -10 ]. The 
key ingredient of probabilistic computing is proba- 
bilistic bit (p-bit), a classical entity that can produce 
stochastic '0's and '1's with controllable probability. 
Unlike a complementary-metal-oxide semiconduc- 
tor (CMOS)-based p-bit that usually requires a 
substantial number of transistors and is often not 
truly stochastic [11 ], nanomaterials with intrinsic 
fluctuation dynamics has emerged to offer great po- 
tential to construct a p-bit [1 ,3 ,4 ,12 -15 ]. Ideally, the 
nanomaterial involved should exhibit binary high 
(0) and low (1) resistance states that spontaneously 
fluctuate in time [16 -20 ], and the fluctuation prob- 
ability can be fine-tuned by external stimulus in a 
non-linear manner to allow efficient computation. 
Various types of nanomaterials can be used to 
construct p-bits with tunable probability values 
whose stochastic features serve as an effective ac- 
tivation function (e.g. Sigmoid or Tanh function) 
[21 ,22 ]. Yet in any experimental systems, instabil- 
ity of stochastic dynamics is always present so that 
broadening from the ideal activation function is in- 
evitable, which can impede the performance of the 
computing tasks. While such a broadening effect 
has been examined theoretically [23 ], a more im- 
portant issue is the actual operational stability of 
a p-bit: whether the probability can return to the 
same value after experiencing extensive operations 
and how such stability impacts on the task perfor- 
mance. Such issue is critical since the input of each

p-bit is determined by the collective outputs from 
other p-bits, all of which are fluctuating over time 
during computation [1 ,24 -26 ]. Owing to the sam- 
pling requirement, massive updating and tuning on 
its probability values takes place on individual p-bits, 
challenging its operational stability. Therefore, find- 
ing nanomaterials that can produce tunable probabil- 
ity with high operational stability is desirable to im- 
prove the performance of probabilistic computing. 
In this work, we use an electronically phase 
separated (EPS) manganite nanowire to construct 
an operationally stable p-bit. In a simple two-probe 
geometry, we show direct control of two-state resis- 
tance fluctuations by nano-ampere input currents to 
achieve full-range probability tuning without assist- 
ing transistors. The probability curve fits well with 
the Sigmoid function—the basis of stochastic neu- 
rons in probabilistic computing. More importantly, 
we demonstrate that under extensive switching 
operations, the current-controlled p-bit shows ex- 
ceptionally high stability with broadening of the 
probability values to be < 1.3%. Numerical simu- 
lation results suggest that our operationally stable 
p-bit plays a key role in achieving correct inference 
in a Bayesian network by strongly suppressing the 
relative error as compared to p-bits with large stan- 
dard errors, displaying the potential for superior 
computing performance. In addition, our nanowire 
is also capable of generating random numbers with- 
out any additional data processing, indicating stable 
and true stochasticity with cryptographic quality. 
RESULTS 
Full electrically tunable probability in 
manganite nanowire 
We used manganite (La2/3 Pr1/3 )5/8 Ca3/8 MnO3 
(LPCMO) thin film as a prototype material in this 
study to exploit the tunability on its fluctuation dy- 
namics (see Methods and Fig. S1 for sample growth 
and characterization). The LPCMO system has been 
well known for its large-scale electronic domains 
whose dynamics is highly tunable by external stimuli 
[27 -29 ]. When the system is spatially confined to 
the length scale of the EPS domain, the electronic 
transport is often governed by the dynamics of a 
single residing domain which fluctuates between the 
ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) and charge ordered 
insulating (COI) states due to thermal instabil- 
ity near its phase transition point, as confirmed 
from experiments, theoretical model and simula- 
tions [30 -32 ]. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the LPCMO 
nanowire is ideal for such purpose, where a DC 
current source is applied as input, and the resistance 
values are monitored using a data acquisition system 
(see Fig. S2 for nanofabrication details). Figure 1 b 
shows the resistance vs temperature curve of the

nanowire between 103 and 92 K where the overall 
nanowire is in the insulating background. When 
decreasing temperature, clear resistance jumps on 
the order of 1 M  are observed with a noticeable 
window of fluctuation towards lower resistance 
states. Such behavior can be attributed to a single 
domain that is dynamically fluctuating between the 
high-resistance COI and the low-resistance FMM 
states in a stochastic manner, which is sensitively 
detected by the transport measurements. 
Next, we show that the stochastic domain dy- 
namics can be well-controlled by directly tuning 
the input current using a simple two-probe geom- 
etry without any additional source of excitation. 
To demonstrate this behavior, we monitored the 
time-resolved resistance fluctuation at different 
input current levels. Figure 1 d shows three represen- 
tative examples. For an input current of 55 nA, the 
resistance of the nanowire spontaneously fluctuates 
between two resistance states but predominantly 
resides in the high-resistance state with a small prob- 
ability to transit into the low-resistance state. When 
increasing the input current to 61 nA, the domain 
fluctuates between the high- and the low-resistance 
states with nearly equal probability. When the input 
current is increased to 68.5 nA, the domain preferen- 
tially resides more in the low-resistance state. Here 
we define the probability pas the fraction of the low- 
resistance state in the total collected data. Figure 1 c 
plots the probability p vs input current curve. The 
probability can be continuously tuned from 0 to 1 
when the input current is raised from 35 nA to 90 nA. 
The physical origin of the current-tunable prob- 
ability of the LPCMO nanowire can be attributed 
to either electric field effects or local Joule heating 
effects [33 ]. Here, we can exclude the local Joule 
heating effect by comparing the probability values 
at different temperatures and current (see Fig. S3
and note). Therefore, our results point towards 
the electrical field driven local insulator-to-metal 
transition as the origin of the stochastic dynamics. 
Although the microscopic mechanism of the electric 
field driven phase transition is not fully understood, 
it is likely associated with current induced change 
of local charge distribution which can accurately 
control the energy difference between the COI and 
FMM states [34 -37 ]. We note that the stochastic 
dynamics in our nanowire is fundamentally different 
from other Mott insulators such as VO2 [38 ,39 ]. In 
VO2 , each time a pumping voltage pulse is applied to 
trigger filamentary insulator-to-metal transition and 
induces stochastic relaxation [12 ]. In our nanowire, 
the electronic domain spontaneously fluctuates 
without any pumping voltages. The mechanism 
of ionic motion can also be excluded since the 
electric field to switch our stochastic domain is ∼4 
× 102 V/cm which is several orders of magnitude 
smaller than ionic-motion driven resistive switching 
in manganites [40 ]. We further examined the aver- 
age rate of switching and found to be in between 3 
and 4 ms which is consistent w ith prev ious reports, 
further confirming the intrinsic electronic domain 
dynamics as the physical origin of our observation 
( Fig. S4). In any case, the key observation here is 
that the electric current can actively control a single 
domain's stochastic dynamics under dimensionality 
confinement conditions. 
For probabilistic computing, a stochastic physical 
system that can represent a sigmoid-type activation 
neuron is favored [21 ,41 ]. We fit Fig. 1 d with 
sigmoid function Sigmoid ( x ) = 
a 
1+e−k(x −xc ) (black 
curve), with the fitting parameter a = 0 . 97529 , k = 
0 . 21856 , xc = 60 . 85965 , and the determination 
coefficient is calculated to be 0.9 9 96. An excellent 
match between the fitting curve and experimental 
results is observed, suggesting the high quality of 
our nanowire to serve as a p-bit. Moreover, Fig. 1 c 
shows the probability when the input current is de- 
creased from 90 nA to 35 nA (blue symbols), which 
coincides well with the probability acquired when 
current is increased from 35 to 90 nA (red symbols), 
further demonstrating the stability of domain fluc- 
tuation dynamics under cycles of input current scan. 
In addition, the nature of the strong correlation 
between multiple degrees of freedom in manganites 
allows us to control the p-bit by various external 
stimuli. We explored the effects of magnetic field 
and temperature on manipulating the p-bit behavior. 
Figure S5 shows the pvalues as a function of external 
magnetic field and temperature. In both cases, full- 
range tuning on the probability values between 0 
and 1 is achieved. Such multi-field tunabi lity al lows 
us to implement electrical-current tunable proba- 
bility at flexible temperatures and magnetic fields 
( Fig. S6). We note that there are a few intermediate 
points between 0 and 1 as shown in Fig. 1 c, which 
indicates partial domain switching. These points 
are statistically negligible and wi l l not affect the 
probability determination of our p-bit ( Fig. S7). 
P-bit with high operational stability 
Due to the presence of material impurity or the 
instability from intrinsic nonlinear dynamics in 
real physical systems, broadening of the probability 
curve is inevitable [3 ,4 ,12 ,42 ,43 ], that is, a p-bit can- 
not maintain the same probability value over time 
under a fixed working condition. Our work here 
focuses on solving a more general issue: a p-bit no 
longer outputs with the same probability if its 
operational condition has been changed and 
switched back, e.g. p(I1 ) ̸ = p(I1 →I2 →I1 ) .

curve simulated according to Eq. ( 1 ) with broadening parameter R = 0 . 0007 (LPCMO nanowire-based p-bit), R = 0 . 05 and 
R = 0 . 1 . The circles in the figure represent the average value of the data, and the error bar represents the standard error. 
This issue is critical since during the running phase 
of probabilistic computing, the working condition 
of each p-bit is determined by the collective outputs 
from other p-bits. Since all the p-bits are fluctuat- 
ing over time, the input as well as the operational 
condition of an individual p-bit experiences massive 
updating. Such operational instability may cause 
vital damage to the performance of a probabilistic 
computer. Therefore, it is imperative to test the 
accuracy and stability of our p-bit under repeated 
switching of input signals. To quantify the oper- 
ational stability of our LPCMO nanowire-based 
p-bit, we picked nine current values (52.5, 55, 57, 
59, 61, 63, 65.5, 68.5, 73 nA) as switchable inputs 
according to the p vs I curve in Fig. 1 c which is again 
plotted in the x-y plane in Fig. 2 a. For each input, we 
collected the resistance vs time data for 60 sec to cal- 
culate the probability p. Each input experienced 100 
switching events and the p -values were counted (de- 
tailed procedure can be found in Methods section). 
The resultant distribution of p values is binned, and 
the histogram is depicted in Fig. 2 a. It can be seen 
that the broadening of the probability distribution is 
quite narrow against multiple switching events, indi- 
cating excellent stability of our p-bit under random 
operations. Figure 2 b shows the detailed broadening 
distribution for three representative input currents 
(61, 65.5, 73 nA). Gaussian-type distributions 
are observed in all cases as shown in the fitting 
curves.

To quantify the broadening behavior, the full 
width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian 
peak was calculated to benchmark the accuracy of 
our nanowire-based p-bit. As shown in Fig. 2 c, the 
FWHM is largest for input current of 61 nA with 
the p value around 0.5 and decreases continuously 
with the p value approaching 0 or 1. These results 
suggest high stability of our nanowire-based p-bit 
for probabilistic computing implementation un- 
der extensive sampling or cycling. Furthermore, 
our nanowire shows long endurance after being 
operated over extended periods of time. Figure S8
shows the p vs input current curve after 14 days 
over extensive current-switching operations. The 
resultant curve is nearly identical to the initial one in 
Fig. 1 c, i l lustrating the high endurance of our p-bit. 
We simulated the probabilistic dynamics of a 
p-bit that exhibits operational instability according 
to the model [44 ] (details in Methods section) that 
m (t) = sgn [rand (−1 , 1 ) + tanh [βI(t) ] + ξ(t) ] 
with discretized time step t, effective inverse tem- 
perature β and dimensionless control parameter 
I(t) , e.g. electric current flowing through the 
p-bit. The operational variation of the p-bit is de- 
scribed by a random noise ξ(t) ∼N(0 ,
R 
Z|I(t) | ) 
for I(t) ̸ = I(t −1 ) and ξ(t) = ξ(t −1 ) for 
I(t) = I(t −1 ) , which follows the normal distri- 
bution with a mean of zero and variance determined 
by broadening factors R and Z. The fitting results 
are shown in Fig. 2 c, which yields R = 0 . 0007 and 
Z = 7 . 9983 agreeing well with experimental data. 
We also examined the behavior of two p-bits with 
R = 0.05 and 0.1 as shown in Fig. 2 d. Compared 
to the operationally stable p-bit ( R = 0 . 0007 ) with 
maximum standard error of 1.3%, clear broadening 
from expected value m (t) is observed. The maximal 
standard errors for p-bits of R = 0.05 and 0.1 are 
11% and 16%, respectively. Such a level of standard 
error has been typically observed in several physical 
systems such as phase-changed [3 ,12 ], RRAM [4 ] 
and stochastic MTJ-based p-bits [42 ,43 ], as sum- 
marized in Table S1. Therefore, our work provides 
the metric to compare the operational stability 
on multiple physical implementations of p-bits 
and its influence on the functionalities of Bayesian 
inferences as discussed below. 
Performance of operationally stable p-bit 
in Bayesian inference 
We then demonstrate via simulation that our 
nanowire-based p-bit shows superior performance 
in Bayesian inference, a prototype task in probabilis- 
tic computing [24 ,45 ,46 ]. A Bayesian network is 
essentially a directed graphical model and is capable 
of performing tasks like Bayesian inference [21 ,24 ]. 
Figure 3 a shows the diagram of a genetic circuit 
with four generations. Without loss of generality, it 
is simply assumed that the children (such as C1 and 
C2 ) gets half their genes from their parents (such as 
F1 and M1 ). Hence, the correlation gBaye between 
C1 and C2 is 50% according to Bayesian theory (See 
note in Supplementary information). Similarly, we 
can calculate the correlation between more distant 
family members, such as Aunt M1 and her niece C3 , 
resulting in 25% correlation. 
We constructed a p-circuit where each node is 
represented by a hardware p-bit, interconnected to 
model genetic influences. The correlation between 
two nodes, C1 and C2 , both of which are bipolar 
variables with allowed values of −1 and + 1, can be 
estimated statistically by: 
gstas = 1 
N 
N 
 
i =1 
( C1 ) i ( C2 ) i , 
(1) 
where N represents the sample size in a single statis- 
tical measurement. During simulation, we make M
independent statistical measurements in total, with 
each measurement comprising N = 10 000 samples 
of C1 and C2 . The relative error δ is obtained by com- 
paring the statistical results for all M measurements 
and the one predicted by Bayesian theory, which is 
depicted in Fig. 3 and defined as: 
δ =

× 100% . 
(2) 
Figure 3 c and d show the δ for the number of 
measurements M = 1 to 50 . It is apparent that when 
R = 0 and 0.0 0 07, the fluctuations in δ are minimal, 
indicating that our p-bits can accurately estimate the 
theoretical values with the same number of measure- 
ments. However, when R increases to 0.05 and 0.1, 
the fluctuations in δ significantly increase, leading 
to larger discrepancies between statistical results 
and theoretical values. All the data in Fig. 3 c and d 
converge with increasing number of measurements, 
resulting from the zero mean of random noise ξ(t) 
as assumed in Eq. ( 2 ). 
In Fig. 3 b, we further calculated the effective 
relative error, defined as δeff =

for all 
data demonstrated in Fig. 3 c and d. It is further 
evident that with increasing depth of the network, 
i.e. decreasing correlation between nodes, opera- 
tionally instable p-bits could induce larger relative 
errors, indicating that the error can be amplified 
as the information propagates forward through 
a network with directed graph structure. Recent 
works show that the bidirectional information flow

Boltzmann machines) may be immune from p-bits 
with broadening [23 ,47 ]. However, it is sti l l an open 
question on how a p-bit with operational instability 
plays a role in an undirected graph model. 
The example of Fig. 3 demonstrates a simplest 
family diagram so that each node is affected by only 
two parent nodes. A more realistic task such as 
medical diagnosis usually requires multiple parent 
nodes, which requires a p-bit to work under multiple 
working conditions [48 ]. We show in the Supple- 
mentary information that the relative error δ wi l l 
be further amplified if one increases the number 
of parent nodes ( Figs S9 and S10). These results 
further elaborate the importance of the high stability 
of our experimental p-bit. 
High-quality true random number 
generator 
When a p-bit is operated at probability of 0.5, it 
serves as a random number generator (RNG). 
While pseudo-RNG can be obtained via digital cir- 
cuits, physical systems can acquire true-RNG since 
the randomness originated from intrinsic physical 
fluctuation is imperative for applications such as 
data encryption [49 ,50 ]. A standard practice for 
evaluating the quality of a true RNG is carried out 
via a statistical test suite (NIST STS, sp 800-2 2) 
[51 ]. Here we show that our p-bit can generate high- 
quality true random number without extra logic 
operations. Data with pvalue of 0.5 in our manganite 
nanowire are used where we convert the resistance 
(voltage) values into bitstream of '0's and '1's without 
any further processing, and then feed to the NIST 
suite software. We examined 12 tests (which further 
subcategorized into 161 tests) in the suite and results 
are shown in Table 1 . All the p -values are larger than 
0.01 that passed the tests. Such behavior surpasses 
the quality of random number in most physical sys- 
tems where extra data processing (such as XOR logic 
operations) are required [15 ,17 ,52 ,53 ]. The high 
quality of the random number in our system can 
be directly attributed to the natural stability on the 
dynamical domain fluctuation which is potentially 
suitable for cryptographic applications. Here, a 2 Hz 
sampling rate is used. Further exploration on how to 
increase the true randomness at smaller time scales 
wi l l be an interesting topic [15 ].

DISCUSSION 
Finally, we discussed several aspects on how to 
implement our operationally stable p-bit for scalable 
probabilistic computing. Our nanowire shows a 
simple single layer geometry with a size of 200 nm 
× 2 um which is suitable for building arrays of 
p-bits. Yet, its low working temperature presents a 
limitation for scalable dev ices w ith external elec- 
tronic designs and circuits [2 ]. A possible solution 
and guideline is to raise the transition temperature 
using strain and doping effects. For example, in 
the manganites fami ly, La0.8 Ca0.2 MnO3 thin film 
exhibits strain-induced insulator-to-metal transition 
governed by sub-100 nm electronic domains at room 
temperature [54 ], La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3 thin films show 
tunable insulator-to-metal transition temperature 
between 330 K and 400 K on certain substrates 
[55 ]. When nanofabricated, these systems can be 
promising candidates to explore room-temperature 
p-bits for scalable electronics. Another issue is the 
device-to-device variations which induces inevitable 
variability on the activation functions for different 
p-bits [1 ], even if each p-bit is operationally stable. 
Such effect may impair the performance of the 
computing tasks [23 ,47 ]. A solution is to use extra 
circuits to compensate such variation [56 ]. In our 
case, the probability can be fully controlled by nano- 
ampere currents which may allow a power-saving 
solution on this matter. 
In conclusion, we adopted a novel nanomaterial 
system to generate a fully tunable probabilistic bit 
by controlling the electronic domain transition 
dynamics. The p-bit shows high stability during 
prolonged switching and operations which play a 
critical role in the task of Bayesian inference. Also, 
our nanowire naturally serves as a high-quality 
random number generator without the assistance 
of additional logic operations, favorable for future 
cryptographic applications. Our results can also 
inspire future investigations on the importance of 
p-bit's operational quality on task performances. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Thin film and nanowire fabrication 
Forty nanometre thick (La2/3 Pr1/3 )5/8 Ca3/8 MnO3 
thin films were grown on SrTiO3 substrates by 
pulsed laser deposition (248 nm, 1 J/cm2 fluence) 
at 807°C in 5 × 10 −3 Torr. The basic characteriza- 
tion results are shown in Fig. S1. E-beam lithography 
and argon ion beam etching were applied to fabri- 
cate LPCMO nanowires with 200 nm line width. 
A pair of electrodes (Pd/Au) was patterned using 
E-beam lithography and evaporation with a 2 μm 
gap ( Fig. S2). 
Electrical measurements 
DC electrical currents were supplied by a Keithley 
2450 source-meter. The time-resolved data was 
collected using National Instrument DAQ USB- 
6218 with a sampling rate of 4.5 kHz. Measurement 
is taken by a Quantum Design PPMS system. In 
random number tests, the sampling rate was 2 Hz 
and 200 000 data points are used. We note that 
the remaining three tests required over 1 mi l lion 
data points which were not collected in the current 
experiments. 
Procedure for accuracy test 
For the results in Fig. 2 a, nine input current levels 
were selected (52.5, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65.5, 68.5, 
73 nA) which roughly correspond to the probability 
from 0.1 to 0.9. The measurement procedure is listed 
as follows: (1) randomly choose an input current; 
(2) measure the resistance vs time data for 60 sec to 
calculate a p -value; (3) randomly switch to another 
input current and perform the same measurement 
in (2) to obtain another p -value; (4) repeat the 
process of (2) and (3) for 900 times so that each 
input current is counted for 100 times. The resultant 
p -value distribution is plotted in Fig. 2 a. 
Numerical simulation 
We developed a numerical model to quantitively 
describe the probabilistic dynamics of a p-bit that 
exhibits operational instability: 
m (t) = sgn [rand (−1 , 1) + tanh [ βI(t)] + ξ(t)] 
(3) 
with bipolar output m (t) ∈ {−1 , 1 } at a time step 
t. Here, m (βI ) = tanh (βI ) ; and the probability 
for m (t) to be at state 0 or 1 takes the form of 
P (m (t) = 1 | βI) = sigmoid (βI) , effective inverse

temperature β and dimensionless control parameter 
I(t) , e.g. electric current flowing through the p-bit. 
The operational variation of the p-bit is described 
by a random noise ξ(t) expressed as: 
β(t) ∼N

0 ,
R 
Z| I(t) | 

, 
I(t) ̸ = I(t −1) 
(4) 
that induces a random noise if the operational con- 
dition is changed, following the normal distribution 
with a mean of zero and variance determined by 
broadening factors R and Z, wherein the denom- 
inator Z modulates the dependence of variance 
on the input current I, and the numerator R reg- 
ulates the overall variance magnitude. Distinct 
from thermal noise, here the operational variance 
ξ(t) = ξ(t −1 ) is assumed to be unchanged when 
the operation condition keeps the same between two 
steps, i.e. I(t) = I(t −1 ) . We performed 20 0 0 sta- 
tistical simulations using Eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with each 
simulation comprising 10 0 0 0 sample points of m . 
For the simulation of Bayesian inference, N = 10 0 0 0 
samples were taken for each measurement where C1 
and C2 were sampled simultaneously at each time 
step and gstas is calculated according to Eq. ( 1 ).
