Abstract
The Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation tech-
nique in which data symbols are transmitted in parallel over orthogonal sub-carriers. It has
been adopted in several broadband wireless communication systems thanks to its numerous
advantages, namely, high spectral eﬃciency, immunity to multipath distortion and simplicity
of the receiver architecture to support high data rates and user mobility. However, OFDM
systems are very sensitive to synchronization errors, which destroy the orthogonality between
sub-carriers resulting in an important performance degradation.
Hence, it is important to
implement eﬃcient and relevant synchronization algorithm at the OFDM receiver side. In
addition to the relevance features, the overhead introduced by the insertion of dedicated syn-
chronization signals and the occasioned computational load should also be considered. This
thesis takes an overall look at reduced-complexity data-aided synchronization techniques for
OFDM systems, by trading between performance and computational load in possibly fast
varying environments of wireless transmissions. In particular, we propose several synchroniza-
tion techniques, ﬁrst for single antenna conﬁgurations, which we evaluate in existing standards
(WiFi and LTE). Then, we consider synchronization problem in multi-antenna OFDM systems.
Exploiting a preamble of two identical parts, we propose a new Brute-Force (BF) single-stage
synchronization technique, which carries a diﬀerential correlation based metric that provides
accurate detection. The metric involves a correlation sequence generated from the preamble
sub-sequence and a diﬀerentially modulated version of the received signal. Theoretical and
experimental studies, achieved to evaluate the performance of the BF technique, ensures its
high detection accuracy.
However, the diﬀerential correlation based treatment results in a
huge computational load. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose the Reduced-Complexity
(RC) two-stage technique that splits the synchronization processing into two stages. The ﬁrst
stage, based on sliding correlation, determines a short uncertainty interval over which the
iii

second ﬁne stage is carried. The ﬁne stage is indeed based on diﬀerential correlation which
provides more accurate estimation compared to the ﬁrst stage, yet it is much more complex.
The combined use of sliding correlation characterized by its low complexity and diﬀerential
correlation which is much more complex, carried over a short interval, results in an overall
reduced-complexity approach.
The performance study of the RC technique shows that it
provides almost the same detection accuracy as in exclusive BF diﬀerential correlation based
synchronization.
Furthermore, it requires a computational load comparable to that of the
exclusive sliding correlation based synchronization. To ensure the relevance of both proposed
BF and RC approaches, we evaluate them in the standards IEEE 802.11a/g in which the signal
structure allows to directly apply the proposed approaches.
For more optimized performance, we study the design of the training sub-sequence deﬁned in
the time and frequency domains. The ﬁrst issue gives an important insight on how the training
sub-sequence (length and type) should be chosen in order to achieve a better trade-oﬀbetween
detection performance and complexity. The second issue concerns a further complexity reduc-
tion by the quantiﬁcation of the correlation sequence, for the training sub-sequences generated
in the frequency domain, within a QPSK alphabet (±1 ± j). The so optimized sequence then
allows replacing the diﬀerential correlation operations by simple sign changes. Three schemes
are proposed to search the best QPSK sub-optimal sequence in terms of minimizing the perfor-
mance degradation caused by the quantiﬁcation. Namely, iterative, deterministic and genetic
algorithms based searches are considered.
Furthermore, two new synchronization approaches are proposed, which are based on the
transmission of a Zadoﬀ-Chu (ZC) sequence as temporal preamble. These approaches are based
on diﬀerential correlation and referred to as the Simply-Diﬀerential (SD) approach and the
Doubly-Diﬀerential (DD) approach. Both of the proposed approaches allow accurate detection
of the ZC sequence start. Based on the fact that the LTE standard provides dedicated ZC
sequences for the primary synchronization, the proposed approaches are successfully adapted
and applied to primary synchronization in the LTE standard, which includes symbol start
detection and sector identiﬁer search. The DD approach proceeds in two stages, wherein the
ﬁrst stage, a coarse time estimation is achieved, by localizing the ZC sequence within the
received signal.
In the second stage, cross-correlation of the received signal with the local
known ZC sequence candidates is carried to detect the exact synchronization signal start and
the sector identiﬁer. The SD approach achieves time synchronization and sector search in a
single stage, which is a particular feature compared to the existing detectors and the herein
iv

proposed DD approach. A reduced-complexity implementation of both DD and SD metrics is
also proposed to ensure their suitability to be implemented in the standard.
Finally, we propose a new synchronization scheme for 2×1 MISO-OFDM systems, which
exploits the full spatial diversity provided by diﬀerential Alamouti space-time block coding for
non-coherent detection and thus avoids any channel estimation requirement. At the receiver,
respecting almost the same framework as in the RC approach, a coarse stage is ﬁrst carried
based on sliding correlation to localize the preamble start.
Before carrying the ﬁne stage,
diﬀerential Alamouti decoding should be achieved to recover the transmitted stream. Then,
cross-correlation is calculated during the ﬁne stage, over a short interval around the coarse
time estimate, to ﬁne tune the preamble start estimate. To assess the enhancement provided
through the spatial diversity and to evaluate the loss compared to a coherent unrealistic scheme
where a perfect knowledge of the channel is supposed, we evaluate the proposed scheme in the
case of SISO antenna and of coherent space-time block coded MISO conﬁguration.

Introduction
1.1
General Context
The evolution in wireless communication systems has accelerated since the beginning of the
1990s with the replacement of the ﬁrst-generation analogue mobile networks by the current
second generation (2G) systems (GSM, IS-95), which opened the door for a fully digital network
[1]. The development was continuing with the deployment of the third generation (3G) systems,
namely WCDMA/UMTS [2], HSDPA [3], HSUPA [4], and CDMA-2000 [5], which are referred
to as IMT 2000. Next, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution
(LTE) standard, speciﬁed in 3GPP Release 8 [6], with signiﬁcantly higher data rates than in
3G systems, was considered as 3G evolution. With the 3GPP Release 10 [7], new ideas to
further push the limits for faster data speeds and better coverage are speciﬁed as part of the
LTE-Advanced project, to comply with the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU's)
IMT Advanced requirements for the fourth generation (4G) wireless networks [8]. The plethora
of wireless communication systems is not restricted to mobile cellular networks only, but also
includes wireless local area networks (WLANs), which were standardized by the IEEE (Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) in the 802.11 initial speciﬁcation [9] and followed by
various enhancements in latter speciﬁcations (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n). Also, the IEEE 802.16
standard [10], referred to as WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access), has
been proposed as an alternative wireless broadband network oﬀering diﬀerent services that
have been ameliorated throughout its diﬀerent speciﬁcations (IEEE 802.16a/d/e/f) to support
full mobility. Wireless communication has also roofed broadcast systems such as Digital Audio
1

Chapter 1. Introduction
Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-T and DVB-H) [11,12].
In digital wireless communication systems, data is transmitted in the form of electromag-
netic wave through wireless channel, which represents the propagation media between transmit
and receive antennas. The wireless environment is quite harsh and transmitting high rate infor-
mation under high mobility conditions generally introduces large delay spreads and strong time
variations resulting in a time and frequency selective channel. Also, the spectrum allocation
and bandwidth are critical in most of the above-mentioned wireless communication standards
because the frequency spectrum is limited. To deal with these problems, systems must be
designed to be robust against frequency selective channel behavior, important path losses and
large multipath delay spreads and must provide a high spectral eﬃciency. A promising candi-
date that provides a robust solution for communication over frequency-selective fading channels
is the Multi-Carrier Modulation (MCM) technique [13]. A particular type of MCM that has
gained popularity in a number of applications, such as the LTE, LTE-Advanced, WiMAX
mobile and the recent WiFi versions (IEEE 802.11n/ac and IEEE 802.22), is the Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM).
The OFDM technique avoids the impairments of a frequency-selective fading channel by
converting it into several parallel ﬂat-fading sub-channels, which greatly simpliﬁes the receiver
structure.
The so-obtained ﬂat-fading channels are narrow-band, low-rate, non-frequency-
selective, and allow parallel transmission of multiple symbols while maintaining a high spectral
eﬃciency without causing the Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). By combining multiple low-
data-rate sub-carriers, OFDM systems provide a composite high-data-rate with a long symbol
duration. This helps to eliminate the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which generally occurs
in signals of short symbol duration over multipath channels.
In addition to its robustness
to multipath fading distortions and narrow-band interferences, the greatest beneﬁt of using
OFDM among MCM techniques is its high spectral eﬃciency due to the orthogonality between
sub-carriers. Another key advantage of using OFDM is the eﬃcient and low complexity imple-
mentation through the use of Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)/ Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) algorithm [14].
In the OFDM link, the sub-carriers remain orthogonal as long as the receiver is perfectly
synchronized, which is not generally the case in broadband communication systems. Indeed, the
two major problems in broadband communication, which are the main focus of this thesis, are
Time Oﬀset (TO) resulting from the propagation delay, and Frequency Oﬀset (FO) resulting
2

Chapter 1. Introduction
from a mismatch between the transmitter and receiver local oscillators and/or the Doppler
eﬀect, in case of moving transmitters and/or receivers. The TO causes both ICI and ISI while
the FO causes ICI, which destroy the orthogonality between sub-carriers such that OFDM
symbols can no longer be correctly demodulated. For proper demodulation of OFDM signals,
two important synchronization tasks, namely symbol timing and frequency synchronization,
need to be performed.
The timing synchronization determines the symbol start while the
frequency synchronization aligns the carrier frequency of the receiver as closely as possible
to the carrier frequency of the transmitter. The insertion of a Cyclic Preﬁx (CP), having a
minimum length equal to the channel delay spread, can avoid the interference between symbols
and between sub-carriers, only when the symbol start (FFT window) is properly located. To
this aim, time estimation accuracy is crucial in the synchronization process to allow maximum
tolerance range to multipath channel eﬀects. Indeed, higher accuracy in time estimate means a
smaller probability for the channel delay spread to exceed the supported range and a lower risk
of data detection error. Obtaining near perfect synchronization is not simple under multipath
channel eﬀects, which makes synchronization a very challenging task in OFDM systems.
1.2
Motivation of the Research
A key research challenge in the design of high data-rate communication systems is achieving
accurate synchronization. The design of synchronization techniques, to enable such networks to
be widely deployed, has been addressed in many works. Depending on whether speciﬁc data are
used for synchronization purpose or not, synchronization techniques can be split into two main
classes: Data-Aided (DA) [15]- [22] and Non-Data-Aided (NDA) or blind synchronization [23]-
[29]. Most of the NDA techniques are not totally blind in the sense that some information
might be required to assist the synchronization, such as the channel state or the signal to noise
ratio. In addition, the performance of blind techniques is severely deteriorated in frequency-
selective fading channels. On the contrary, the DA approaches, which require the insertion
of known training sequences, are advantageous because they are capable to produce accurate
estimates of the synchronization parameters in harsh propagation environments.
The DA approaches in [15]- [22] exploit preambles of speciﬁc structures with diﬀerent po-
larity patterns, generally for a predeﬁned training sequence class. At the receiver side, metrics
tailored to the preamble structure are calculated for synchronization purpose. The calculated
3

Chapter 1. Introduction
metrics use either sliding correlation, characterized by its low computational load, or diﬀer-
ential correlation with higher complexity leading to more accurate detection capacities. The
trade-oﬀbetween complexity and accuracy showed an imbalance in existing approaches and
motivated our study on novel DA synchronization algorithms with a particular concern on
reducing the computational complexity while keeping good synchronization performance and
low overhead. The obtained performance motivated our research on practical synchronization
solutions applicable to standardized OFDM systems to allow a maximum of tolerance to the
channel impairments. Furthermore, measures that are able to improve the synchronization
performance incited us to incorporate them in our research, like the use of multiple antennas
at the transmitter and receiver for more reliable reception. Such investment is indeed driven by
the great potentials of combining Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) and OFDM techniques,
which is actually adopted in most of the wireless communication standards.

Chapter 1. Introduction
transmission, as in broadcast application, or for burst data stream transmission, as in wireless
area networks. First, exploiting a single-symbol preamble of two identical parts, we propose a
Reduced-Complexity (RC) synchronization technique that proceeds in two stages. Respecting
the famous Schmidl and Cox algorithm [15], the proposed technique ﬁrst carries a sliding-
correlation based metric to search for a repetitive pattern (in time domain) and provides a
coarse time estimate. Then, a diﬀerential-correlation based metric is carried between a diﬀer-
entially demodulated version of the received signal and a Correlation Sequence (CS) generated
from the preamble. The ﬁne metric is calculated over a short uncertainty interval centered on
the coarse estimate to ﬁne-tune it. The combined use of a coarse stage, with low complexity,
carried continuously and a ﬁne stage, with high complexity, carried over a short interval results
in an overall reduced-complexity approach with satisfactory accuracy as proved by computer
simulations. We also consider the Brute Force (BF) single-stage approach, where diﬀerential
correlation is exclusively used, resulting in a huge computational load. The evaluation of the
proposed techniques is presented in papers [33] and [34] for both the Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN) and the multipath channel, which showed the enhancement obtained by the
proposed techniques compared to the considered existing benchmarks.
To assess the eﬃciency of the proposed BF synchronization technique, we conduct a the-
oretical performance study, which is also valid for the ﬁne stage of the RC techniques. We
approximate the BF metric by a Gaussian distribution to derive a closed form expression of
the preamble start correct detection probability. Then, the theoretical probability of correct
detection is determined and compared to the rate of correct detection given through Monte
Carlo simulations. The performance of the proposed synchronization technique is evaluated
over AWGN and multipath channels and presented in [36] for the case of OFDM modulation.
It is shown that the theoretical probability perfectly agrees with the experimental simulated
rate, which from one hand ensures the accuracy of the proposed BF metric and from the other
hand validates the theoretical analysis. The evaluation of the proposed technique is also car-
ried in the case of Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) systems in [41]. The Gaussian distribution
approximation in the DMT case is rougher than that of the OFDM case, yet the provided
theoretical probability is very close to the experimental rate.
Another component of the thesis work focuses on the adaptation of the proposed synchro-
nization techniques to existing standards. In particular, the IEEE 802.11 standard in which
the repetitive structure of the short and long preamble symbols allows a ﬂexible synchroniza-
tion processing, respecting the proposed techniques that are based on a two identical parts
5

Chapter 1. Introduction
preamble. The proposed techniques (RC and BF) have shown satisfactory performance that
outperforms other well-established methods in the literature and it is published in [39].
As stated above, the proposed synchronization techniques have no further constraint on
the preamble than its repetitive structure. To enhance the performance through the preamble
choice, we carry an experimental study of the impact of training sub-sequence choice on the
detection performance, for the case of binary time domain generated sequences. In addition to
randomly generated sequences, pseudo-noise sequences including m-sequences with the speciﬁc
case of Gold and Kasami sequences are considered. This gives an important insight on how
the training symbol should be chosen in order to achieve better detection performance with
the same amount of training overhead and computational load. To further reduce the com-
putational load, an optimal choice of the uncertainty interval, over which the ﬁne metric of
the RC approach is calculated, can also be adopted. Moreover, we provide an analytical and
numerical complexity study to assess the trade-oﬀbetween performance and complexity. We
also compare the computational load of the proposed RC technique to those of existing algo-
rithms as well as the herein proposed BF technique. These contributions have been included
in [35,38].
To further reduce the computational load of the proposed RC technique, we suggest an
optimization of the CS which is used during the ﬁne stage in the correlation with a modiﬁed
version of the received signal. The idea is to replace the diﬀerential correlation operations,
involved in the ﬁne metric calculation, by simple sign changes.
In this way, the encoding
sequence must be chosen within a QPSK alphabet (±1 ± j). So, we need to derive the best
sub-optimal CS in terms of providing near-optimal performance provided by the initial CS. To
this aim, three algorithms are proposed: a deterministic algorithm, an iterative algorithm and
a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based search scheme. The same amount of computational load is
saved by the three proposed algorithms. Yet, the GA based one provides the better detection
performance at the expense of high sequence search complexity. The search of the sub-optimal
sequence being carried oﬀ-line, completely relaxes the complexity constraints. The classical
deterministic and iterative design algorithms are presented in [37] while the GA based design
method is presented in [40].
Exploiting the Zadoﬀ-Chu (ZC) sequences, which are known by their good correlation prop-
erties well suited for synchronization purpose, we propose two new synchronization approaches
which are based on diﬀerential correlation and are referred to as Doubly-Diﬀerential (DD) [42]
6

Chapter 1. Introduction
and Simply-Diﬀerential (SD) [43]. In both of the proposed schemes, the synchronization pro-
cess consists of detecting the start of a ZC sequence within the received signal.
As these
sequences are used in the 3GPP LTE standard, we adapt the proposed SD and DD approaches
to the primary synchronization processing, which consists of detecting the Primary Synchro-
nization Signal (PSS), made from ZC sequences, and the sector identiﬁer. The DD approach
proceeds in two stages, wherein the ﬁrst one it provides a coarse time estimate which is reﬁned
in the second stage. The sector identiﬁer is also detected during the ﬁne stage through cross-
correlation between the received signal and the local known ZC sequence candidates. The SD
approach has the particularity of processing both tasks jointly in a sole stage, which to the
best of our knowledge, is not the case of existing approaches.
The last part of this thesis is dedicated to the synchronization in multi-antenna OFDM
systems. In particular, we propose a new synchronization approach that exploits diversity,
through space-time block coding, as a measure to ameliorate the detection performance. To
avoid channel estimation requirement in such scheme, we opt for diﬀerential Alamouti cod-
ing/decoding. Respecting the framework of the RC approach, the herein proposed synchro-
nization processing also exploits a preamble of two identical parts and is split into two stages.
The coarse stage is achieved identically to the RC approach. Then, once the received signal
is diﬀerentially decoded, cross-correlation with the preamble is carried during the ﬁne stage
over a short interval centered on the coarse time estimate. Simulations carried over Rayleigh
channel show signiﬁcant enhancement compared to the single antenna systems and a slight
loss with respect to MISO coherently decoded systems when a perfect knowledge of channels
responses at the receiver is assumed. The results of studies carried in MISO-OFDM systems
are presented in [44].
To summarize, in terms of publications, this work led to:

Organization of the Dissertation
In this section, we provide an outline of the thesis which organizes the previously detailed
contributions on 6 chapters.
Chapter 2 introduces the basic characteristics of radio propagation environment and pro-
vides the fundamentals of OFDM technique, which is exploited to cope with severe multipath
fading in mobile radio channels. The channel eﬀects on OFDM signal are also analyzed. The
chapter ends with a review of the most important properties of the OFDM technique.
Chapter 3 starts with a study of the sensitivity of OFDM systems to the time and frequency
synchronization errors. Then, it gives a review on existing synchronization techniques available
in the literature. Both blind and data-aided approaches are described with an emphasis on
preamble based ones covering diﬀerent preamble structures.
Chapter 4 presents the two proposed synchronization techniques for OFDM systems. Namely,
the reduced-complexity and the brute-force which gain their robustness from the diﬀerential
correlation based metric. The chapter provides a theoretical performance study of the BF
technique whose aim is to validate the detection accuracy performance gotten from Monte
Carlo simulations. This study is then carried in the case of DMT technique. The detection
accuracy and the computational load of both proposed approaches are also evaluated in this
chapter. Finally, the chapter ends with the application of the proposed techniques (RC and
BF) to the standards IEEE 802.11a/g.
Chapter 5 is devoted to a deep performance study of the proposed RC technique, which can
also be applied for the BF approach. In particular, the eﬀect of the preamble training sub-
sequence type/length on performance as well as the eﬀect of the uncertainty interval length
on the detection accuracy are analyzed. The optimization of the correlation sequence, for the
frequency based preamble training sub-sequence, is also treated in this chapter.
Then, in chapter 6 we investigate synchronization using Zadoﬀ-Chu sequences. In particular,
we consider the primary synchronization for 3GPP LTE systems to which we apply the two
new simply-diﬀerential (SD) and doubly-diﬀerential (DD) techniques, followed by a comparison
made between the proposed approaches and some existing benchmarks.
Chapter 7 is dedicated to the synchronization in MISO-OFDM systems, where our contri-

bution is based on exploiting diversity in the space and the time through diﬀerential space-time
block coding for non-coherent synchronization.
Finally, the dissertation is concluded by giving a summary of the contributions, perspectives
to the carried work and suggestions for open research subjects.

Chapter 2
Wireless Communications and
OFDM Basics
High data rate transmission is a major challenge for wireless communication systems because
they require wide bandwidth channels. Indeed, wireless channels have frequency selective fad-
ing characteristics which introduce interference between symbols at the receiver end, due to the
multipath echoes. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has become a popu-
lar technique for transmission over wireless channels in many recent applications such as digital
audio/video broadcasting, local/metropolitan area networks, vehicle communications and as it
is adopted for the 4G LTE, LTE-Advanced and mobile WiMAX mobile (IEEE 802.16e). Also,
it is used in recent WiFi versions (IEEE 802.11n/ac and IEEE 802.22) and some digital TV
broadcasting standards.
To better understand the communication over wireless channels using OFDM technique, this
chapter starts with a presentation of the basic characteristics of radio propagation environment,
followed by channel modeling. Then, a thorough description of the fundamentals of OFDM
modulator/demodulator, its main parameters and features is provided.
We ﬁrst highlight
the OFDM capacity to cope with many constraints in broadband transmissions like spectral
eﬃciency and channel-frequency selectivity. We then underline the OFDM impairment. Later,
we present the mathematical modeling of the OFDM signal before and after transmission over
wireless communication channels. Through this model, it is shown that the use of a cyclic
extension of OFDM transmitted blocks allows an immunity to timing errors up to a certain
11

level and greatly simpliﬁes the equalization at the receiver side. The chapter ends with a review
of the most important advantages and drawbacks of the OFDM modulation scheme.
2.1
Communications over Wireless Channels
There are two fundamental features in wireless communications that make it challenging and
interesting. These features are not as signiﬁcant in wired communications. First, the limited
spectrum range available for transmitting data in high bit rate. Second, the variation of the
channel gain due to the small-scale eﬀects of multipath propagation, as well as large-scale
eﬀects such as attenuation due to the distance and shadowing by obstacles. How to deal with
these aspects is paramount in the design of wireless communication systems. In this section,
we focus on the characterization of the propagation channel.
2.1.1
Radio Propagation
Radio signals generally propagate according to three mechanisms: reﬂection, diﬀraction, and
scattering. The appropriate channel model depends strongly on the intended application and
diﬀerent models are used for the diﬀerent applications such as cellular and WLANs.
The
channel model directly aﬀects the steps of designing, evaluating, and deploying any wireless
system in the objective of ensuring adequate coverage and quality of service. As such, the
channel model to be adopted should be wisely chosen.
In mobile radio channels, the transmitted signal undergoes diﬀerent channel eﬀects which
are multipath propagation, Doppler spread, shadowing and path loss [57]:
• Multipath propagation occurs as a consequence of reﬂections, scattering, and diﬀraction
of the transmitted electromagnetic wave at natural and man-made objects. Thus, at
the receive antenna, a multitude of waves arrives from several directions with diﬀerent
delays, attenuations, and phases. The superposition of these waves results in amplitude
and phase variations of the composite received signal.
• Doppler spread is caused by moving objects in the mobile radio channel. The changes
in the phases and amplitudes of the arriving waves lead to time-variant multipath prop-
agation. Even small movements on the order of the wavelength may result in a totally
12

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
diﬀerent wave superposition. When the signal strength varies due to time-variant multi-
path propagation, the channel is said fast fading or time selective.
• Shadowing results from the obstruction of the transmitted waves by objects (for example
hills, buildings, walls, and trees) along the paths of a signal, which results in more or less
strong attenuation of the signal strength. Compared to fast fading, longer distances have
to be covered to change the shadowing constellation signiﬁcantly. The varying signal
strength due to shadowing is called slow fading and can be described by a log-normal
distribution.
• Path loss indicates how the mean signal power decays with distance between the transmit-
ter and the receiver. In free space Line Of Sight (LOS), the mean signal power decreases
with the square of the distance between the transmit and the receive antennas such that
the received power, at distance d and for a wavelength λ, decreases proportionally to

2πd
λ
2
. In a mobile radio channel, where often no line of sight (NLOS) exists, signal
power decreases with a power higher than two and typically varies between three and
ﬁve.
A mobile wireless channel can be characterized by the variations of the channel strength
which can be roughly categorized into large-scale fading and small-scale fading. For any given
position in the space, the received signal is aﬀected by large scale eﬀects such as path-loss,
shadowing, diﬀraction and rain or foliage attenuation. This is more relevant to issues such
as cell-site planning and can be avoided through power control at the transmitter. Small-
scale eﬀects are caused by rapid ﬂuctuation of the signal due to multipath propagation and
movement of either the transmitter or the receiver. They are more relevant to the design of
reliable and eﬃcient communication systems [58].
2.1.2
Frequency Dispersive Channels
As indicated above, the received signal is a superposition of several signals from diﬀerent
directions resulting in a spatial interference pattern.
For a moving terminal through this
interference pattern with a velocity v, the received signal amplitude ﬂuctuates in time (fading).
In the frequency domain, these ﬂuctuations are seen as a superposition of many Doppler shifts
corresponding to diﬀerent directions resulting in a Doppler spectrum instead of a sharp spectral
line located at the carrier frequency fc. The maximum Doppler frequency shift is υmax = vfc
c ,
13

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
where c and v stand respectively for the speed of light and the speed of the antenna. For an
angle φ between the direction of the received signal and the direction of motion, the Doppler
shift is υd = υmax cos(φ). The apparent received frequency will be fc + υmax if the receiver is
moving directly towards the incoming way and fc −υmax if it is moving directly away. Thus,
the apparent received frequency will always be in the range of fc ± υmax [59,60].
An example of frequency dispersive channel of two paths is presented in the ﬁgure 2.1
showing the eﬀect of time selectivity on both short and long symbols, where D(f) and r(t)
respectively denote the Doppler spectrum and the received signal.
Figure 2.1: Frequency dispersive (time selective) channel and its eﬀects on short and long
symbol [60].
For this channel, when neglecting the delay spread between the received signal versions, the
baseband signal aﬀected by only the Doppler shift is expressed as
r(t) = ej2πυ1ts(t) + αej2πυ2ts(t),
(2.1)
where s(t) stands for the baseband transmitted signal and υ1 and υ2 stand for the Doppler
shifts corresponding to the two paths. The Doppler eﬀect introduces two types of distortion to
the received signals: signal variation over time and broadened signal spectrum. Let us deﬁne
channel coherence time as Tc =
1
υmax , which corresponds to the period over which the channel
remains constant. If the Doppler shift is comparable to the signal bandwidth (Tc ≈Ts), the
channel is considered as time-selective (fast-fading). On the other hand, when the Doppler
shift is insigniﬁcant compared to the symbol rate (Tc ≫Ts), the channel is considered time-
non-selective (slow-fading). An approximation of the coherence time is Tc =
0.4
υmax was
presented in [61].

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
2.1.3
Time Dispersive Channels
The arrival time of scattered multipath signals are inevitably distinct. The impact severity of
these delays on the transmitted signal strongly depends on the product of the signal bandwidth
with the channel delay spread. The channel can be represented as a linear transfer function
h(t). Due to the multipath propagation, the CIR of length LH is composed of a large number of
scattered impulses received over Np diﬀerent paths with diﬀerent propagation delays spanning
the time interval [0, LH] as [60]
h(t) =
Np−1
X
p=0
αp(t)δ(t −τp(t)),
(2.2)
where αp and τp stand respectively for the attenuation and the time delay of the pth path and
δ(.) is the Dirac delta function which may be time-dependent in the case of non-stationary
channels.
Since the multipath delays τp are distinct, the frequency response H(f), which is the Fourier
transform of h(t), exhibits amplitude ﬂuctuation. Such ﬂuctuation in the frequency domain
will distort the waveform of a broadband signal. Speciﬁcally, in digital communications, a
channel is considered frequency-selective if the multipath delays are distinguishable relative
to the symbol period Ts =
1
BW < τmax −τmin. On the other hand, if the signal bandwidth
(BW) is suﬃciently narrow, the channel frequency response within the signal bandwidth can
be approximated by a constant. A wireless channel is considered frequency-non-selective
(ﬂat) if the multipath delays are indistinguishable relative to the symbol period Ts =
1
BW ≥
τmax −τmin [59, 60]. In this case, the interference between symbols can be neglected. An
illustration of a time dispersive channel of 3 paths is depicted in ﬁgure 2.2 showing the eﬀect
of frequency selectivity on both narrowband and broadband signals, where h(t) and H(f)
respectively denote the CIR and frequency response.
We deﬁne the coherence bandwidth Bc as the range of frequencies, over which the channel
gain remains fairly constant. The coherence bandwidth over which the correlation is above
90% and 50% are approximated to respectively B90% =
1
50τrms and B50% =
1
5τrms [61,62], where
τrms =
p
E(τ 2) −(E(τ))2 is the root mean square of the delay τ.

In practical cases, the wireless channel may be time and frequency dispersive at the same time.

(2.5)
In selective channels, there can be signiﬁcant variations in the frequency response throughout
the bandwidth and there are typically nulls in the frequency response where the channel greatly
attenuates parts of the spectrum (deep fading in frequency selective channel), which greatly
degrades the transmission performance.
Signals with small bandwidth compared to the channel coherence bandwidth experience ﬂat
fading where the channel can be supposed constant. If its response is outside a null, almost
16

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
perfect reception is guaranteed. On the other hand, high data rate transmission requires wide
bandwidth resulting in a transmission over inevitably selective channels. This may deteriorate
the signal at the receiver end, which makes the use of sophisticated reception tasks crucial. Tra-
ditionally, channel equalization is utilized to compensate the channel eﬀect. However, since the
multipath temporal delay usually spans multiple symbols, the channel equalization is becoming
more complicated. In addition, complex adaptive equalizers with feedback loops have to be
used to track the channel variations. Alternatively, transferring a broadband signal into parallel
narrowband sub-streams allows to overcome the frequency selectivity. We then deal with multi-
carrier modulation techniques. In this thesis framework, we are concerned in particular with
the OFDM modulation which has become the core of various modern wireless communication
systems. OFDM is indeed a parallel data transmission technique that can eﬃciently mitigate
the eﬀects of multipath distortions. Basically, it converts the wideband channel into several
narrowband sub-channels, each experiencing ﬂat fading, thus oﬀering multiple advantages over
conventional single-carrier modulation techniques.
2.2
OFDM Modulation
The technique of multi-carrier transmission has received wide interest, especially for high data
rate applications thanks to their capability to combat hostile frequency-selective fading encoun-
tered in mobile communications. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is one
among the multi-carrier modulation techniques, where a single data stream is transmitted over
a number of overlapping lower-rate sub-carriers.
2.2.1
OFDM History
The concept of parallel transmission of data over dispersive channels was ﬁrst proposed as early
as 1957 in the formerly new contribution of Doelz et al. [65], while the ﬁrst OFDM schemes date
later in 1960s, when Chang [66] published a paper on the synthesis of bandlimited orthogonal
signals for multichannel data transmission. He presented a pioneering principle of transmitting
signals simultaneously over bandlimited sub-channels without interference between neither
symbols nor channels. Later in 1967, Salzberg analyzed the eﬃciency of such parallel data
transmission systems [67], where he concluded that "strategy of designing an eﬃcient parallel
system should concentrate on reducing cross-talk between adjacent channels rather than on
17

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
perfecting the individual channels themselves, since the distortions due to the cross-talk tend
to dominate".
These systems required banks of sinusoidal sub-carrier generators and demodulators. For
a large number of sub-channels, the number of modulators and demodulators are increased
proportionally, which results in a high implementation complexity. This drawback limited the
application of OFDM to military systems until 1969, when Salzberg and Weinstein proposed
a digital system which realized parallel data transmission using Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT) [68]. The transmitted data is the Fourier transform of the original time domain signal
and the bank of coherent demodulators was replaced by the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
(IDFT). Right after, Weinstein and Ebert provided deeper description of the DFT use to
perform the baseband modulation and demodulation and investigated the eﬀects of linear
channel distortion in [69]. For highly eﬃcient processing, a digital baseband implementation
based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was proposed for computing DFT, which reduced
the number of arithmetic operations from N2 to N log2 N (N is the FFT size). The insertion
of a guard interval between consecutive symbols helped to eliminate most of the interference
but the system could not keep perfect interference immunity over time dispersive channel. This
problem was treated in the early 1980s by Peled and Ruiz [70] who suggested to ﬁll the empty
guard interval with the cyclic extension of the OFDM symbol, known as Cyclic Preﬁx (CP).
If the CP length is longer than the impulse response of the channel, the interference between
symbols can be completely eliminated. Furthermore, the CP acts as if it is performing cyclic
convolution with the channel which implies orthogonality between sub-carriers over a time
dispersive channel when the CP is longer than the Channel Impulse Response (CIR).
OFDM technique applications were proposed in 1985 by Cimini [71] who investigated the
performance of OFDM modems in mobile communication and in 1987 Alard and Lasalle [72]
applied OFDM in digital broadcasting systems. Later, with the improvement of its eﬃciency
and low implementation complexity, OFDM technique has found its way into most of the
recent wireless systems, such as the Wi-Fi, WiMAX, LTE and DVB as well as DAB broadcast
standards [1,11,12].

OFDM Basics
2.2.2.1
Principle
The basic idea behind any multi-carrier modulation technique is to divide a high-data rate
stream of information units into several parallel lower-rate streams, then each of the obtained
data streams modulates one separate carrier (sub-carrier or tone). Hence, the symbol length Ts
is increased signiﬁcantly to counter the channel delay spread and mitigate the ISI eﬀect. The
sub-carriers then experience ﬂat-fading since their corresponding sub-channels bandwidth is
chosen to be signiﬁcantly lower than the channel coherence bandwidth, which ensures a robust
transmission in frequency-selective channels.
To obtain a high spectral eﬃciency, the sub-channels relative signals overlap in the fre-
quency domain and are orthogonal to each other. Unlike the traditional Frequency Division
Multiplexing (FDM) techniques, in OFDM all the sub-channels have overlapping spectrum but
the sub-channels can still be received without adjacent interference as long as the sub-carriers
are orthogonal. This overlapping avoids the wasting of bandwidth used to eliminate the ICI
in non-overlapping sub-carrier schemes. Indeed, as shown in ﬁgure 2.3.a, to implement the
conventional parallel data transmission by classical FDM, a guard band must be introduced
between adjacent sub-carriers to avoid the ICI. This leads to ineﬃcient use of the rare spectrum
resource. For the OFDM technique depicted in ﬁgure 2.3.b, the sidebands from one channel
become null at the positions corresponding to the other sub-channels.
As the sub-carriers
are orthogonal to each other, there is no interference between overlapping sub-carriers while
achieving almost 50% bandwidth savings.
For simple and reduced complexity pulse forming and modulation, the sub-carrier time
pulse is chosen to be rectangular and is truncated to the interval [0, Tu], where Tu is the
OFDM symbol duration. The truncation in the time domain implies a cardinal sine (sinc)
shape on each sub-channel frequency response with zero at integer multiples of ∆f = 1/Tu,
which is the minimum sub-carrier spacing required for the orthogonality to hold. As sketched
in ﬁgure 2.4, even though they are overlapping, sub-carriers can be separated from each other
since orthogonality guarantees that the interfering "sincs" have null values at the frequency
where the "sinc" of interest has a peak.

2.2.2.2
Block Diagram
A simpliﬁed block diagram of an OFDM system is depicted in ﬁgure 2.5. As seen, the ﬁrst
stage in the transmitter is the data mapping, which consists in mapping the incoming binary
data stream into data symbols using one of the modulation techniques like BPSK (Binary
Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), QAM (Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation). The resulting complex high bit-rate data stream is split into Nu parallel low-
rate streams by using a simple Serial to parallel (S/P) converter to prepare data symbol for
alteration to OFDM waveform. The number Nu here corresponds to the sub-carriers number
and the FFT size. Then, the Nu-point IFFT is applied to blocks of Nu data symbols, which
corresponds to modulating the Nu orthogonal sub-carriers. The obtained samples form an
OFDM block samples (temporal signal) which are then serially transmitted over the channel.
Usually, Nu is taken as a power of 2 in order to enable the application of the highly eﬃcient
(Inverse) FFT algorithms for modulation and demodulation. In some cases, not all the Nu
sub-carriers are modulated using the data symbols, some of them are modulated using pilot
symbols (symbols known at the receiver) for the purpose of channel estimation. To each OFDM
symbol of length Nu, a cyclic preﬁx of length Tg (Ng samples) that exceeds the maximum delay
spread of the multipath propagation channel (τmax−τmin) is added. Finally, the CP-prepended
OFDM symbols are transmitted through the air interface.
At the receiver, the cyclic preﬁx, which may be corrupted by ISI from the adjacent symbols,
is ﬁrst removed and a serial to parallel conversion is carried to restitute separate OFDM symbols
of length Nu each given to the demodulator. This latter is an Nu-point FFT which would give

the data symbols back in the frequency domain. Then, the data symbols are demodulated
based on the corresponding modulation technique (QPSK, QAM, ...) used at the transmitter
to get back an estimate of the transmitted bits stream. In the block diagram, channel coding
and interleaving blocks can be incorporated and applied to the input data in order to improve
the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance and to reduce the burst symbol error rate of the system,
respectively. They are not considered in our system.

We note that due to the channel distortions, the received symbols will be deteriorated at

the receiver end, which requires sophisticated receiving mechanisms such as equalization and
synchronization.
2.2.3
OFDM System Model
The above described features of the OFDM signal generation and demodulation are mathemat-
ically derived in this section. This will lead to the conclusion that, using the OFDM principle,
data symbols can be transmitted over multipath channels without disturbing each other.
2.2.3.1
OFDM Signal Generation
The continuous OFDM signal is expressed as the sum over time of a number of OFDM symbols.
Over the lth OFDM block transmitted on time interval [lTu, (l+1)Tu], the sum signal resulting
from the modulation of sub-carriers (k = 0, .., Nu −1) by data symbols sl,k is pulse shaped
then transmitted. So, the baseband OFDM signal can be represented by
s(t) =

(2.8)
For the orthogonality between diﬀerent sub-carriers to be hold, the sub-carrier spacing ∆f was
chosen to be equal to the reciprocal of the symbol duration ∆f =
1
Tu . We recall that the or-
thogonality will enable the receiver to separate the OFDM overlapping sub-carriers components
22

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
without errors. The OFDM transmitted signal (equation (2.6)) discrete formulation using the
sampling period Tb = Tu/Nu and fc = 0 (baseband) leads to the OFDM signal s(t = mTb)

(2.9)
The OFDM system can be implemented using banks of modulators and demodulators in
the continuous-time analog domain. In practice, however, the entire baseband processing is
performed in the discrete-time digital domain. The banks of modulators and demodulators are
replaced by DFT which can be implemented either by dedicated hardware or software running
on a digital signal processor. As expressed in (2.9), for a given symbol index l, the OFDM
signal can be generated through the application of an Nu-point IDFT to the data symbol
sl,k(m), k = 0, . . . , Nu −1 as

0 ≤k < Nu.
(2.12)
According to the deﬁnition provided in (2.11), the transmitted symbol sl(m) is the IDFT
of the data sequence sl,k for 0 ≤k < Nu. Therefore, the whole transmitted signal s(m) in
equation (2.9) corresponds to the concatenation of blocks obtained by performing the IDFT
on blocks of Nu data symbols.
In general, Nu is chosen to be a power of 2 so that the DFT can be very eﬃciently imple-
mented using the FFT algorithm to improve the speed of execution [73]. Indeed, the number
of complex multiplications per symbol is reduced from N2
u to Nu log2 Nu, which is especially
23

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
important for large number of sub-carriers.
2.2.3.2
Spectral Eﬃciency
In the OFDM modulation, sub-carrier spacing is carefully selected so that sub-carriers spectrum
overlap as shown in ﬁgure 2.4. Due to this overlapping, the bandwidth is much more eﬃciently
used than in the classical multi-carrier systems. Let us deﬁne the spectral eﬃciency as the bit
rate per unit bandwidth in bits/s/Hz [71]. Considering that each sub-carrier conveys a symbol
taken from M-ary constellation (M = 2a, a ∈N) over a duration of Tu = TbNu seconds. Then,
the total bit rate over the Nu sub-carriers for the corresponding M-ary system is Rb =
a
Tb .
Accounting for the fact that the OFDM symbol useful duration Tu is extended with a CP of
length Tg. Then, the eﬀective bit rate is given by
Rb =
Tu
Tu + Tg
a
Tb
bits/s.
(2.13)
The frequency spacing between adjacent sub-carriers is ∆f =
1
NuTb .
Therefore, the total
bandwidth occupied by the Nu sub-carriers is
BW = Nu∆f = 1
Tb
.
(2.14)
Thus, the spectral eﬃciency of an OFDM system becomes
β = Rb
BW =
Tu
Tu + Tg
a
bits/s/Hz.
(2.15)
For an optimal system without guard interval insertion (Tg = 0), the spectral eﬃciency becomes
β = a bits/s/Hz. Nevertheless, in OFDM mobile communication systems the Guard Interval
(GI) is of crucial importance to cope with multipath eﬀects and to maintain the orthogonality
between sub-carriers.
Hence, in practice an OFDM system will not achieve the maximum
bandwidth eﬃciency.
2.2.3.3
Cyclic Preﬁx
Although the use of OFDM modulation itself reduces the eﬀect of ISI thanks to the larger sym-
bol duration, OFDM symbols are still not immune to the large channel delay spread. In order
24

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
to completely remove the ISI, a guard interval is inserted between consecutive symbols. The
required length of the guard interval depends on the channel characteristics and applications.
Usually, the GI is selected to have a length of one tenth to a quarter of the symbol period,
leading to an SNR loss of 0.5 to 1 dB. To have ISI free transmission, the guard interval length
Tg (Ng in its discrete form) should be greater than the delay spread (Tg ≥τmax −τmin). The
complete OFDM symbol of length Ns samples is built up by its useful part generated as in
equation (2.11) whose length (in terms of samples) is Nu to which a guard interval of length
Ng is prepended (Ns = Nu + Ng) as depicted in ﬁgure 2.6. The CP added to the useful part
of the OFDM signal leads to blocks of length T = Tu + Tg where Tu = NuTb, Tg = NgTb and
T = (Nu + Ng)Tb.
Figure 2.6: An OFDM symbol consisting of a useful part prepended with a cyclic preﬁx.
The most popular solution is to insert a copy of the last part of the OFDM symbol, referred
to as Cyclic Preﬁx (CP). Due to the CP insertion, the transmitted signal becomes periodic and
the eﬀect of the time-dispersive multipath channel is equivalent to a cyclic convolution. Due
to the properties of the cyclic convolution, the eﬀect of the multipath channel is equivalent
to a pointwise multiplication of the transmitted data constellations by the channel transfer
function over each sub-carrier. Hence, the sub-carriers remain orthogonal [48]. If the sub-
channel spacing is chosen to be equal to the coherence bandwidth, B90 for 90% correlation and
the guard interval is chosen to be equal to 5 times the delay spread of the channel, then the
length of the guard interval will be 10% of the length of the useful part [50].
It is worth noticing that, as the transmitted blocks contain Ns = Ng + Nu elements instead
of Nu, the OFDM signal expression in (2.9) is slightly modiﬁed to take into account the CP

Channel Eﬀects on the OFDM Signal
The reason for which the information transmitted over the sub-carriers can still be separated
at the receiver is their pairwise orthogonality. Unfortunately, multipath distortion is (almost)
unavoidable in radio communication systems, which aﬀects the received signal. In this case, the
transmitted signal is received in several delayed versions with diﬀerent amplitudes and phases.
In this section, we study the eﬀect of the mobile propagation channel on OFDM signal.
We here consider the complex baseband-equivalent channel model of the continuous-time
channel in (2.4), taken at a given time instant. The discretization aﬀects the continuous time-
variant impulse response h(τ, t) in both τ and t directions at the same time leading to the
discrete time-variant CIR denoted by h(m).
The received signal is the convolution of the
transmitted signal s(m) with the channel impulse response h(m) given by
y(m) = h(m)s(m) + η(m),
(2.18)
where η(m) denotes a complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with variance σ2
η.
In the following, matrix notation will be adopted. It is straightforward to show that the
OFDM transmitter/modulator can be represented by a simple matrix multiplication. First,
let sl = [sl,0, sl,1, . . . , sl,Nu−1]T be the data sequence of independent complex symbols which
modulates the orthogonal sub-carriers during the lth OFDM symbol and ¯sl its IDFT output.
Then, the lth OFDM symbol in expression (2.9) can be written in matrix form as

Time Non-Dispersive Channels
In this section, we consider that the channel in (2.22) is ﬂat-fading with a unique direct path
corresponding to an impulse response with one complex constant coeﬃcient which we denote by
hl0. By the property of the Fourier transform, the convolution in time domain is multiplication
in frequency domain; that is the convolution of the input signal with the CIR is equivalent
to the multiplication of the spectrum of the input signal with the channel transfer function.
Thus, all the frequency components in the input signal are simply multiplied by a complex
constant hl0. Assuming coherent demodulation and perfect time/frequency synchronization,

channel, simple channel equalization is suﬃcient to demodulate the OFDM received symbols.
2.3.2
Time Dispersive Channels
Time dispersive channels result from multipath propagation and frequency selective channels.
Such channels are characterized by an impulse response with several coeﬃcients, which causes
interference between diﬀerent OFDM symbols and diﬀerent sub-channels. Generally, the chan-
nel delay spread τmax −τmin is lower than the CP extended OFDM symbol period T and only
two consecutive symbols may partially interfere with each other. Hence, the elements in the
received signal yl in equation (2.21) contain elements belonging to both ¯sl and ¯sl−1.
To face the eﬀect of interference between consecutive symbols, a CP of length Ng is inserted
before any OFDM block (as a preﬁx). Thus the lth transmitted OFDM block, denoted as ¯s,
consists of Nu samples useful part prepended with Ng samples for the CP, having the following
structure
¯sl = [¯sl,Nu−Ng,¯sl,Nu−Ng+1, . . . ,¯sl,Nu−1,¯sl,0,¯sl,1, . . . ,¯sl,Nu−1]T .
(2.24)
Its received corresponding symbol is then denoted by
yl = [yl,−Ng, yl,−Ng+1, ..., yl,−1, yl,0, yl,1, ...yl,Nu−1]T .
(2.25)

Based on the previous expressions and assuming that Ng > LH so that the channel impulse
response samples hp are zero valued for p indexes higher than Ng (hp = 0
∀p > Ng), the
received signal yl then converts into

As the CP is subject to inter-symbol interference, it is discarded at the receiver side (the

It can be observed that, thanks to the CP, the circular channel matrix (2.22) preserves its

property in (2.29), in which H is an Nu × Nu circular matrix. Hence, there exists a diagonal
matrix ¯H generated from the diagonalization of H by the IDFT/DFT matrices WH and W
as
¯H = WHWH,
(2.30)
where ¯H is NuxNu diagonal matrix whose kth diagonal elements can be expressed as
¯Hk,k =

i=0
hie−j 2πki
Nu .
(2.31)
Thus, the received vector yl can be written as
yl = WH ¯HW¯sl + ηl = WH ¯Hsl + ηl.
(2.32)
Hence, the demodulated received symbol r is recovered as
rl = Wyl = ¯Hsl + η′
l,
(2.33)
where η′
l = Wηl. The kth element of the vector rl, denoted by rl,k, is expressed as
rl,k = ¯Hk,ksl,k + η′
l,k,
(2.34)
where sl,k and η′
l,k correspond respectively to the kth elements of sl and η′
l. At this stage,
when we consider the sole sub-carrier k, we note that each transmitted symbol undergoes an
equivalent ﬂat fading channel. Hence, on each sub-channel, we have a propagation aﬀect similar
to that of ﬂat fading (2.23) in which a simple one-tap equalization per sub-carrier is suﬃcient
to recover the transmitted data as
ˆsl,k = rl,k
¯Hk,k
.
(2.35)
The equalization consists only in dividing the received data symbol rk by the estimated sub-
channel transfer function Hk,k. The channel can be estimated based on many criteria: Least
Squares (LS) or Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) criteria by exploiting pilots
or training sequences or using blind approaches.
In the case of non-ISI-free reception, the channel matrix H can no more be digonalized
in a DFT basis as before. Therefore, ICI occur leading to a loss of orthogonality and thus
performance deterioration. To overcome this inconvenience, we aim to provide ISI-free recep-
30

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
tion through accurate time synchronization which provides a maximum tolerance to channel
delay spread. From this point of view, time synchronization remains a very challenging task
in OFDM based communications. Time synchronization issues will be later discussed.
2.4
Pros and Cons of OFDM
OFDM systems show much favorable properties suitable for broadband communications such
as high spectral eﬃciency, robustness to channel fading, immunity to interference, capabil-
ity of handling very strong echoes (multipath fading). However, it exhibits some limitations
like sensitivity to synchronization errors and high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which
make sophisticated reception techniques mandatory. We here summarize the strengths and
weaknesses of the OFDM modulation technique.
a) Advantages
• Robustness to multipath fading channels: the multipath fading eﬀect is the most
critical limitation in broadband wireless communication. Indeed, if data are transmitted
at high rate so that the symbol period is lower than the channel delay spread, each
received symbol will spread into adjacent symbols causing ISI. Thanks to the guard
interval insertion between successive symbols and if the echoes are shorter than the
symbol period, the energy from one symbol only aﬀects the ﬁrst part of the next symbol
which generally corresponds to the guard interval. In other words, if the guard interval
is longer than the CIR, the eﬀects of ISI are localized in the useless part of the OFDM
signal which corresponds to the guard interval to be eliminated before demodulation.
Furthermore, by splitting the available channel to several ﬂat sub-channels, OFDM treats
each of them as narrow-band channel, hence reducing the overall eﬀect of frequency-
selective fading on the data transmission. Hence the ISI can be reduced and even elimi-
nated. This in turn reduces the complexity of the receiver equalizers. In conclusion, the
OFDM modulation scheme is robust in a frequency selective fading environment. This
is one of the greatest beneﬁt of using OFDM as the modulation scheme in the modern
standards in high-speed wireless communication.
• High Spectral Eﬃciency: in classical multi-carrier systems, frequency guard bands
31

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
have to be inserted resulting in poor spectral eﬃciency. By removing the guard bands
between adjacent sub-channels, OFDM technique makes eﬃcient use of frequency spec-
trum. In other words, the sub-carriers have the minimum frequency separation required
to maintain orthogonality of their corresponding time domain waveforms, yet the signal
spectra corresponding to the diﬀerent sub-carriers overlap in frequency. The spectral
overlapping results in a waveform that uses the available bandwidth with a very high
bandwidth eﬃciency. The orthogonality between sub-carriers will ensure that the re-
ceiver can separate the OFDM sub-carriers without errors as there is no mutual inﬂuence
between sub-carriers.
• Simple equalization: as mentioned before, one of the main reasons to use OFDM is its
capability to deal with large delay spreads. For a given delay spread, the implementation
complexity of an OFDM receiver is signiﬁcantly lower than that of a single-carrier system
with an equalizer [49]. The comparison made in [49] shows that the complexity reduction
achieved using OFDM technique is due to the fact that when the bit rate is doubled,
an equalizer has to be made twice as long at twice the speed, so its complexity grows
quadratically with the bit rate, while the complexity of OFDM grows slightly faster than
linear.
Furthermore, if the bandwidth of each sub-channel is lower than the channel coherence
bandwidth, a frequency-ﬂat channel model can be assumed for each sub-carrier and the
equalization will be radically simpliﬁed. The eﬀect of the multipath channel on each sub-
carrier can be represented by a single valued complex number aﬀecting the amplitude
and phase of each subcarrier. Hence, the equalization can be carried out by a simple
one-tap equalizer operating in the frequency domain.
b) Drawbacks
• High Peak-to-Average Power Ratio: an OFDM signal consists of several indepen-
dently modulated sub-carriers, whose time-domain envelope can be modeled as the su-
perposition of the corresponding sinusoidal signals with diﬀerent frequencies and phases.
When Nu signals are added constructively, they produce a peak power that is Nu times
the average power, leading to a high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). A high
PAPR ratio brings disadvantages like an increased complexity of the analog-to-digital
(A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters and a reduced eﬃciency of the radio fre-
32

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
quency power ampliﬁer. In other words, the output power ampliﬁer has to maintain high
linearity across the entire range of input signal level. Otherwise, the signal will suﬀer
from non-linear distortion resulting in out-of-band emission that causes interference to
adjacent sub-channels.
There have been many studies to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio in OFDM
systems. A classiﬁcation into three categories was introduced in [48]. Namely, signal dis-
tortion techniques (clipping, peak windowing, and peak cancellation), coding techniques
(forward error correction) and scrambling techniques.
• Sensitivity to synchronization errors: while OFDM technique solves most of the
wideband mobile communication limitations, it introduces new problems itself. By us-
ing high numbers of narrow sub-carriers, the system becomes very sensitive to time and
frequency oﬀsets. When the time oﬀset (symbol synchronization error) is large, the FFT
interval will include a symbol boundary or start in the region of the symbol contami-
nated by ISI. Thus, the orthogonality is lost and ICI and lSI will occur. Furthermore,
the existence of the frequency oﬀset introduces ICI which destroys the orthogonality
among the OFDM sub-carriers and leads to performance degradation. Hence, perfect
synchronization in time domain and frequency domain is a challenging subject.
To face these limitations, there have been studies in the literature addressing the time
and frequency synchronization.
Two classes of synchronization can be distinguished:
Blind and Data-Aided. The former approaches exploit the redundancy in the CP, as
the work of Van de Beek in [24], which is more suited to continuous ﬂow transmission,
such as streaming video. Whereas, data-aided approaches use a preamble before OFDM
symbols data transmission, as in [15]. These synchronization methods, cost in terms of
bandwidth but are generally more eﬃcient than blind ones, especially for bursty-packet
traﬃc.
In this thesis, we are going to deeply review the sensitivity of OFDM systems to time and
frequency synchronization errors. We will also present an overview on existing algorithms and
propose several algorithms for the symbol timing and carrier frequency estimation.

Chapter 2. Wireless Communications and OFDM Basics
Conclusions
This chapter presented the fundamental concepts to understand the main object of the thesis.
It started by describing the mobile propagation environment and provided a description of
the propagation channel. This latter was characterized by its dispersion that aﬀects transmit-
ted signal in both time and frequency. The mobile radio channel was characterized by time
variation and frequency selectivity. To cope with these constraints, we introduced the OFDM
transmission technique that is considered as an eﬃcient transmission technique in harsh prop-
agation environment. Indeed, OFDM modulation provides an eﬃcient use of the bandwidth
through overlapping orthogonal sub-carriers. The mathematical expression of OFDM signal
was given, followed by the eﬀect of propagation channel on it. It was shown that as the cyclic
preﬁx duration is longer than the channel delay spread, it is possible under some conditions
(related to synchronization) to completely avoid the interference between symbols and sub-
channels. Towards the end of the chapter, the main advantages and disadvantages of the use
of OFDM technique were recalled.
Although OFDM technique can guarantee an ISI-free reception if the cyclic preﬁx is longer
than the maximum channel delay spread, accurate symbol start detection is crucial for trans-
mission over frequency selective channel to provide the maximum tolerance to channel multi-
path temporal spread eﬀects. Furthermore, any residual frequency oﬀset destroys sub-channels
orthogonality and causes ICI, which results in performance degradation at the receiver. These
observations highlight the importance of synchronization issues for OFDM systems to make
it possible to beneﬁt from their numerous advantages, especially in harsh wideband wireless
transmission channels.
34

Chapter 3
Synchronization in OFDM Systems:
State of the Art
The high spectral eﬃciency oﬀered by the use of OFDM technique is due to the orthogonality
between sub-carriers.
However, in an OFDM link, it is possible that this orthogonality is
destroyed.
This can indeed result from several factors such as the Doppler shift resulting
from the relative movement between the transmitter and the receiver, the frequency mismatch
between the oscillators at two ends, large timing errors and phase noise. Before an OFDM
receiver can demodulate the sub-carriers, it has to perform synchronization to maintain the
orthogonality among them. At least two tasks are achieved. First, the location of the symbol
boundary and the optimal symbol timing must be found (time synchronization) to minimize
the eﬀects of ICI and ISI. Second, the carrier frequency oﬀset in the received signal has to be
estimated since any frequency oﬀset introduces ICI.
The ﬁrst part of this chapter provides an analysis of the eﬀect of both timing and frequency
synchronization errors on demodulation performance at the receiver. In the second part, we
provide a survey on existing synchronization techniques proposed in the literature to mitigate
channel impairments. These techniques can be roughly classiﬁed in two categories. On the ﬁrst
hand, blind (non-data aided) techniques which exploit either the redundancy in the CP or the
statistical properties of the received signal. On the other hand, data-aided techniques which use
known training symbols transmitted at the beginning of each frame to achieve synchronization.
The training symbols must have speciﬁc properties which makes them distinguishable from data
35

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
symbols. Data aided techniques generally provide better detection than the blind techniques.
Our work is concerned with preamble-based techniques. Hereafter, we give a state of the art
od such techniques.
3.1
Eﬀects of Synchronization Errors
In this section, we analyze the eﬀects of imperfect time and frequency synchronization on de-
modulated OFDM signal. Time oﬀset occurs when transmitter and receiver do not have a
common time reference for the same selected IFFT/FFT block, which causes both ISI and ICI.
Thus, to properly demodulate the OFDM symbols, the receiver needs to ﬁnd symbol bound-
aries. Frequency oﬀset includes carrier/phase and sampling clock errors. The carrier/phase oﬀ-
set is the diﬀerence between the frequencies of the transmitter and the receiver local-oscillators,
which introduces additional term in the received baseband signal resulting in ICI. The receiver
needs to compensate the frequency oﬀset for coherent detection. Symbol clock (sampling fre-
quency) oﬀset results from the diﬀerence in sampling clock between the local oscillators of the
transmitter and the receiver. This kind of oﬀset results in a gradually growing timing oﬀset
and a slightly large sub-carrier spacing. In our work, we mainly focus on time oﬀset eﬀects
and give a brief survey on frequency oﬀset.
3.1.1
Eﬀects of Time Synchronization Errors
As mentioned in section 2.2.3, each OFDM symbol is composed of two parts: a guard interval
of length Ng and a useful part of length Nu. The useful part consists of the data to be processed
by the FFT block, while the guard interval is generally a cyclic extension of the useful part
that is removed before passing the received data to the FFT demodulator block. In order
to remove the guard interval and align the data window with the useful part, the receiver
needs to ﬁnd the start position of the useful part. Through this criterion, the optimal timing
instant will be the boundary between the cyclic preﬁx and the useful part. Hence, when the
data capturing window is placed in this position, the FFT window will cover the useful part
only. Furthermore, if the timing oﬀset is large the FFT window will cover the boundary of two
adjacent symbols. In this case, the input to the FFT demodulator will be the concatenation
of interfering components belonging to diﬀerent symbols.
36

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
As illustrated in ﬁgure 3.1, the FFT window can be located at diﬀerent positions regarding
the correct symbol start.
Figure 3.1: Early and late synchronization.
Let us denote the timing oﬀset normalized with respect to the sampling period Tb by ϵ (sup-
posed to be integer), which has no unit and which is equal to the number of samples between
the transmitted signal s(n) and the received signal s(n −ϵ). In case of ideal synchronization,
the FFT window will be positioned in the correct time and will exactly be aligned with the
useful part of the symbol. Such a case corresponds to a timing oﬀset ϵ equal to zero and
the entire guard interval will be discarded thus leading to a correct data demodulation FFT
window alignment. In practice, however, due to propagation delay, the time oﬀset ϵ is always
non-zero and the start of the FFT is moved away from the optimal start point. The impact of
an FFT timing oﬀset at the receiver is widely studied in the literature [48,49,74,75].
In order to understand the eﬀects of the TO, we refer to the mathematical analysis in [74].
We consider a case of non-dispersive AWGN channel and assume that we do not use any kind
of guard interval (Ng = 0). The demodulated data symbol ˆsl,k for the kth sub-carrier and the
37

(3.1)
According to the equation above, the TO results in three eﬀects: a phase rotation, ISI and
ICI terms. The phase rotation is proportional to the sub-carrier index k and the TO ϵ and it
aﬀects the useful part of the demodulated symbol. The ISI term occurs because of the inclusion
of samples belonging to the next symbol in the current one. On the other hand, the ICI are
inherent to disturbances caused by sub-carriers being adjacent to that of the present symbol
(loss of orthogonality). In addition to the TO eﬀects, the demodulated samples suﬀer from
attenuation of their useful part and are aﬀected by an AWGN η of variance σ2
η .
Now, extending the study to the case of late synchronization in the presence of a CP
(Ng > 0). When the synchronization tick is positioned later than the optimal time index, the
FFT data window will contain Nu −ϵ samples from the actual OFDM symbol and ϵ other
samples collected from the CP of the next OFDM symbol; if there is no following OFDM
symbol, the last samples are ﬁlled up with noise.
On the other hand, early synchronization shown in ﬁgure 3.2, in this case, has no major
eﬀect as long as the CP length is suﬃciently high. Indeed, TO results in a misalignment of the
FFT window with ϵ samples and the demodulated symbol contains ϵ samples of the current
OFDM symbol CP and Nu−ϵ of its useful part. The symbol timing oﬀset is now equivalent to a
time delay in digital sampling. It is a well-known fact that delay in the time domain represents
a linear phase shift in the frequency domain. Assuming non-dispersive channel (maximum
channel delay spread τmax = 0) and a CP longer than ϵ, then the timing error would result in a
simple phase shift, that increases linearly with the sub-carrier index k, without any additional
ICI or ISI. The demodulated data in this case becomes
38

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
ˆsl,k = sl,kej2π
k
Nu ϵ + ηl,k.
(3.2)
This analysis remains valid as long as the starting position of the data window is within
the ISI-free region of the guard interval. The ISI-free region is deﬁned as the time interval in
which ϵ is greater than zero but less than Ng −τmax + 1. Here, a number of ϵ samples from
the guard interval and Nu −ϵ samples from the useful part will be selected, which are still free
from interference from adjacent symbols.
Figure 3.2: Early synchronization: ISI-free reception and ISI-aﬀected reception.
The last case of early synchronization consists in ISI reception where the TO is greater
than Ng −τmax. The data window is still within the current symbol boundary. Nevertheless,
some samples coming from the CP are corrupted by interference from samples belonging to
the preceeding symbol due to the large channel delay spread. Then, the data FFT window will
cover two subsets of the received samples taken as:
• ISI Free: [r−Ng+τmax+1, r−Ng+τmax+2,...,rNu−ϵ−1]
• ISI Aﬀected: [r−ϵ,r−ϵ+1,...,r−Ng+τmax]
The third term in equation (3.1) corresponding to the ISI contribution is not zero valued.
Hence, the demodulated data is aﬀected by adjacent sub-carriers which are no longer orthogonal
to each other. This leads to ICI that may severally aﬀect the orthogonality between the OFDM
sub-carriers.
39

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
We conclude that a proper cyclic extension with suﬃciently long period can be used to
eﬀectively cancel the ICI and ISI caused by timing oﬀset.
However, to take advantage of
spectral eﬃciency the CP generally does not exceed 20% of the symbol length. For frequency-
selective channels with high delay spread, the ISI-free zone is reduced, thus limiting the TO
that can be tolerated by the receiver. To face this limitation, accurate time synchronization
must be achieved, which makes synchronization one of the biggest challenges of any OFDM
communication system.
Next, in section 3.2, we provide a survey on some of the existing
synchronization approaches and their classiﬁcation.
3.1.2
Eﬀects of Frequency Synchronization Errors
Compared to single-carrier systems, OFDM systems are much more sensitive to Frequency
Oﬀsets (FO), which may result from two kinds of misalignments that are hereafter explained.
Before applying the FFT at the demodulation step, the received analog signal is ﬁrst sam-
pled at instants determined by the receiver clock T ′
b, which may be diﬀerent from the sampling
clock of the transmitter Tb. This results in a Sampling Clock Frequency Oﬀset (ScFO), whose
normalized version is denoted by ξ = T ′
b−Tb
Tb
. Furthermore, the local oscillators at the trans-
mitter and the receiver do not generate exactly the same oscillator frequency thus leading to
a Carrier Frequency Oﬀset (CFO) between them denoted by ∆fc [74]. In the presence of FO
(ScFO or CFO or both), the received signal sampled at time instant nT ′
b is aﬀected by a phase
rotation θ(nT ′
b) given by
θ(nT ′
b) = 2π(1 + ξ)∆fcnTb.
(3.3)
The sampling clock can be assumed to be close to its actual value, thus with no eﬀect on the
result of the FFT output [57]. Also, in [50] it was shown that the oscillators can be accurate
to a factor of about 10−5 as a relative misalignment. Hence, the diﬀerence in sampling rate
is typically much lower than one sample per OFDM symbol resulting in much less harmer
distortion caused by the ScFO on the FFT output than the CFO.
As mentioned above, ∆fc is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the transmitter and receiver
carrier frequencies. In wireless communications, the CFO comes mainly from the mismatch
between oscillating frequencies in the Local Oscillators (LO) of the transmitter and the receiver.
It can also result from Doppler eﬀect of the channel due to relative movement between one end
40

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
or both ends. For indoor communications, the Doppler eﬀect can be neglected [48].
Figure 3.3: Components of total Carrier Frequency Oﬀset.
The CFO is partitioned into two parts (see ﬁgure 3.3): the integer part (IFO) multiple of
the sub-carrier spacing denoted by K and the remainder fractional part (FFO) ν which is lower
than half of the sub-carrier frequency spacing (−0.5 ≤ν < 0.5). The CFO is considered with
respect to the sub-carrier spacing as [76]
∆fc = (K + ν) 1
Ts
.
(3.4)
In the absence of ISI (correct timing synchronization), the lth demodulated OFDM symbol,
under the eﬀect of a normalised CFO ∆fc, turns into [74]

with cross-sub-carrier local frequency oﬀset parameter

From (3.5), it is shown that the demodulated signal consists of a rotated and attenuated copy
of the desired symbol component sl,k (the ﬁrst term) and ICI from all the other sub-carriers
(the second term), which occur when the frequency oﬀset ∆fc ̸= 0. Generally, the attenuation
41

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
factor sinc(πak,k) is very close to 1 and can therefore be neglected. Also, the time-invariant
term ejπak,k cannot be distinguished from the channel gain factor (not presented in the equation
(3.5)) and is thus incorporated into it.
The eﬀect of the CFO on the spectrum is illustrated in ﬁgure 3.4. It is shown in 3.4.a
that in the case of perfect frequency synchronization (∆fc = 0), the FFT output of the kth
sub-carrier will consist only in the signal transmitted on its corresponding sub-carrier without
any interference from the neighboring sub-carriers. Nevertheless, it is obvious from ﬁgure 3.4.b
that in the presence of CFO (∆fc > 0), the spectrum will not have single peaks anymore at the
kth sub-carrier. Indeed, interference from adjacent sub-carriers will occur and the spectrum is
no longer null in its adjacent sub-carrier's frequency.
(a) ∆fc = 0
(b) ∆fc > 0
Figure 3.4: Eﬀect of CFO on the frequency spectrum of an OFDM signal with 5 sub-carriers.
We also note from ﬁgures 3.3 and 3.4 that the IFO K does not aﬀect the OFDM signal
spectrum, but only shifts it up or down. If not properly compensated, the FFO ν causes inter-
carrier interference at the FFT output, resulting in the sub-carrier orthogonality loss, while the
IFO K circularly shifts the sub-carriers away from their original locations in the output of the
FFT such that the whole OFDM burst cannot be properly decoded. Consequently, the system
performance may be signiﬁcantly degraded, which makes frequency synchronization critical to
the performance of OFDM systems.
Usually, the frequency oﬀset and timing errors are more dominant than the sampling clock
error. In the remaining of this thesis, we assume a perfect sampling clock recovery and consider
the symbol-timing error normalized with respect to the sampling period Tb as well as the
42

fractional part of the carrier frequency oﬀset, normalized with respect to the sub-carrier spacing
∆f and which we denote by ν. Therefore, at time index d and considering a multipath channel

(3.7)
where ηd stands for the sample of zero-mean complex Gaussian noise process with variance

η. Next, we denote the start of the received OFDM symbol by τ = t0 + ϵ, where t0 stands
for the transmission start point and ϵ is the time oﬀset in units of OFDM samples.
The
synchronization process we are focusing on consists in detecting the OFDM symbol start τ
and the fractional part of the carrier frequency oﬀset ν. We provide a survey in several time
and frequency synchronization approaches in the next section.
3.2
OFDM Synchronization Techniques
The OFDM synchronization techniques can be roughly classiﬁed in two main categories: Data-
Aided (DA) and Non Data Aided (NDA). These latter, also known as blind techniques, are
based on the analysis of the received signal by exploiting either the intrinsic redundancy present
in the CP of each OFDM symbol [24, 27] or the statistical properties of the received signal
[28,29]. However, these techniques suﬀer from inaccuracy in the estimation of synchronization
oﬀsets. This hints towards severe loss of performance especially in high Doppler environments.
The former category of synchronization techniques, on the other hand, exploit special dedicated
data that are time and/or frequency multiplexed with the transmitted data as a preamble
[15,22]. The preamble generally results in a slight overhead that reduces the spectral eﬃciency
but it greatly enhances the detection accuracy. In this section we take a brief look at some of
the synchronization algorithms existing in the literature. Then, we describe DA algorithms,
which will serve as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the techniques that are proposed
in this thesis.

3.2.1
Blind Synchronization
Thanks to the CP insertion, the ﬁrst Ng samples of an OFDM symbol are identical to its Ng
last samples. This redundancy is exploited in many works to determine the synchronization
parameters.
The ﬁrst CP based techniques were proposed by Van de Beek et al.
in [24-
26]. Even if these estimators provide diﬀerent estimation performance, they all provide an
illustrative view on how a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator exploits signal correlation for
time and frequency oﬀsets estimation. Considering the example in [24], in which the timing and
frequency oﬀsets are jointly estimated through the maximization of the log-likelihood function,
initially proposed in [23], as

ated over 9 OFDM symbols. The curves clearly show peaks at the start of each OFDM symbol
but the peak amplitude presents signiﬁcant variation. Recall that the estimator is initially de-
rived under the assumption that the channel distortion consists of only additive noise [23]. The
violation of this assumption under frequency selective fading channels may deteriorate severely
its performance, which justiﬁes the worsening in ﬁgure 3.5.b, where the peak amplitudes show
signiﬁcant variation, and in 3.5.c where some peaks completely disappear.

This estimator is attractive because of its low complexity and low overhead, however its
performance in fading channels suﬀers from a severe deterioration.
The correlation-based
timing metric 3.8, was later adopted for coarse timing synchronization in many standards.
More sophisticated synchronization approaches were later proposed. The estimator in [27]
45

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
requires neither the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nor the power delay proﬁle
of the fading channels and it jointly estimates the TO and FFO. This algorithm is derived by
partitioning the received OFDM samples into a few subsets of neighboring uncorrelated entries
and treating the channel gains as unknown deterministic variables. Due to this separation, the
log-likelihood function, which is based on each subset, is expressed as a function of a parameter
associated with channel gains, instead of the channel gains directly. As a result, it does not
need the knowledge of the power delay proﬁle of the fading channel. However, the channel
maximum delay spread τmax should be known and should be shorter than the CP length Ng.
Therefore, this technique can not be considered as totally blind.
By taking advantage of the incurred losses from ISI and ICI which are caused by synchro-
nization errors, the work in [28] proposes a TO estimator based on the maximization of the
Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR). This estimator does not require neither knowl-
edge of the channel proﬁle nor transmitted data. For complexity reduction, this Maximum
SINR based algorithm uses an early-late gate technique which results in a slight performance
degradation. The early-late gate technique consists in searching the TO along a limited range
instead of the whole one. In [29], the signal statistical information is used to estimate the time
synchronization parameters. This estimator is totally blind and it exploits the interference
that results due to the loss of orthogonality between sub-carriers. Indeed, the second-order
statistics of the resulting interference is proportional to the oﬀset from the optimum sampling
point.
Several other blind methods use the cyclostationarity of OFDM signals for time and fre-
quency synchronization. The approach in [30] estimates the TO and the FO either sequentially,
by using the cyclic correlation coeﬃcients or independently, by maximizing the cyclic spectrum.
This algorithm requires the knowledge of the CIR. This limitation was overcome in the algo-
rithm proposed in [31] where the channel response is modeled by a random process and cyclic
correlation is exploited to estimate both TO and FO. In [32], a frequency domain processing
is proposed to recover the FO and the TO through power spectrum and spectral correlation
computation. This algorithm also does not require any knowledge of the channel state.
To summarize, we highlight that the main advantage of using blind synchronization in
OFDM systems is the improvement of the bandwidth eﬃciency. However, a common problem
for most blind synchronization techniques is their sensitivity to multipath distortion. Indeed,
most of blind techniques involve signiﬁcant performance degradation in frequency selective
46

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
fading channels, like the estimators proposed in [24], [28] and [29]. Furthermore, information
about the SNR and/or CIR might be required in some cases [28,30].
Since the OFDM technique is the most preferable choice for broadband transmissions over
multipath fading channels, the estimation of synchronization parameters should be resilient to
multipath distortion. Various methods for time and frequency synchronization are proposed
in the literature to enhance the synchronization performance by inserting training sequences,
pilots or other types of pre-known data in the transmitted signal. In our work, we address the
training sequence based synchronization where speciﬁc data are sent at the start of each data
frame as a preamble. More speciﬁcally, we are concerned with preamble-based methods where
a preamble with a priori known structure by the receiver is sent for synchronization purpose.
According to the case, the preamble content is not necessarily known to the receiver.
3.2.2
Data-Aided Synchronization
The Data-Aided synchronization techniques are well suited to harsh wireless communication
environments for their rapid processing carried in most times directly in time domain without
channel knowledge requirement. Furthermore, the use of a specially designed preamble helps
the receiver to achieve satisfactory synchronization. Many preamble based synchronization
techniques have been proposed to estimate the TO and the FO, either jointly or separately.
Hereafter, we address a survey on most used training sequence types for the purpose of syn-
chronization. Then, we investigate the class of existing estimators based on preamble presence
for synchronization purpose, which will be relevant as benchmarks for performance comparison
with our proposed preamble-based techniques.
3.2.2.1
Training Sequence Types
Training sequences that are used for synchronization generally have common features exploited
to provide adequate metric shapes. Their main required property is related to the autocorre-
lation, which gives the correlation of the sequence with its cyclically shifted versions. For a
sequence B = [b0, . . . , bN−1], the periodic autocorrelation function R is given by
47

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
RB(m) = 1

N−1
X
n=0

n−m.
(3.14)
Having sharp correlation peak and very weak out of phase values as is the case for white
noise allows more accurate synchronization. Some well-known classes of sequences, such as
pseudo random binary sequences, also known as Pseudo-Noise (PN), Constant Amplitude Zero
Auto Correlation (CAZAC) sequences, as well as Golay complementary sequences, oﬀering this
interesting property are here introduced. It is worth to note that these sequences are widely
used in digital communications for a variety of applications such as channel estimation [77]
and Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS/ CDMA) systems [78].
a) Pseudo-Noise Sequences
A Pseudo-Noise (PN) sequence is a semi-random sequence in the sense that it appears random
within the sequence length, fulﬁlling the needs of randomness, but the entire sequence repeats
indeﬁnitely [79]. These sequences have the potential to appear random to the channel but
be predictable to the user equipment and are characterized by a large peak to highest side-
peak ratio.
In the context of synchronization, if the autocorrelation of the sequence used
for synchronization presents high side-peaks, the robustness to noise and multipath eﬀect is
generally unsatisfactory and the synchronization may miss the ﬁrst path and in some cases
may detect an erroneous path.
M-sequences: as their name indicates, the m-sequences (Maximal length sequences) are
the sequences of maximum possible period of N = 2m−1 where m ∈N [80]. They are obtained
from primitive polynomial, using an m-stage binary shift register with linear feedback [81] and
can also be generated through shifting an m-sequence [82]. The most interesting property of
m-sequences is their two-valued autocorrelation function (1, −1/N). The autocorrelation of an
m-sequence B is
RB(m) =





1
m = 0, N, 2N, ...
−1
N
otherwise.
(3.15)
In this respect, for suﬃciently long sequences, m-sequences are adequate for synchronization
thanks to the absence of side-peaks and low out-of-phase autocorrelation value.
48

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
Gold sequences: the Gold sequence class is an important sub-class of m-sequences [83].
They are generated from speciﬁc m-sequences, recognized as preferred pairs known to have
a minimum value of the out-of-phase cross-correlation. Using gold sequences provides higher
peak to highest side-peak ratio which is expected to oﬀer better detection accuracy.
It is
important to mention that Gold sequences are not deﬁned for m multiples of 4.
Kasami sequences: like the Gold sequences, the Kasami sequences are derived from m-
sequences [84] and have the advantage of avoiding the sub-peaks problem in m-sequences.
There are two diﬀerent sets of Kasami sequences: small and large sets. We note that Kasami
sequences are deﬁned for only even values of m.
b) CAZAC Sequences
Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequences are important in waveform
design because of their optimal transmission eﬃciency and tight time localization properties.
The ﬁrst property is guaranteed thanks to the constant amplitude while the second one is
guaranteed by the zero autocorrelation of CAZAC sequences. There exists numerous well-
known coding sequences among which we can list Chu codes [85,86], Frank-Zadoﬀcodes [87],
generalized Frank sequences [88], and Milewski sequences [89]. The set of CAZAC sequences
remains invariant under several operations. For instance, the fast Fourier transform of CAZAC
sequence is still a CAZAC sequence [90], which motivates their use in OFDM systems. However,
the behavior of side-peaks can diﬀer drastically among the CAZAC families.
c) Golay Complementary Sequences
Golay complementary sequences, also referred to as Golay pairs, have interesting properties
that are exploited for synchronization aim. They are characterized by the property that the
sum of their autocorrelation functions for the same shift m is zero-valued over all out-of-phase
positions.
Rb(m) + Ra(m) = 0
m ̸= 0.
(3.16)
Binary Golay sequences are initially deﬁned in [91, 92] for a length of 2m. This set oﬀers a
number of (2mm!) diﬀerent sequences. An extension to the case of non-binary sequences was
detailed in [93] for number of (2hmm!) diﬀerent sequences when ﬁxing the constellation size to
49

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
h (2hPSK) with h > 1.
In addition to the correlation property, Golay sequences are extensively used for the low
PAPR value (3 dB) when they are mapped to the OFDM sub-carriers [93,94].
3.2.2.2
Time Synchronization
The contributions in [15]- [22] exploit preambles of speciﬁc structures with diﬀerent polarity
patterns, generally for a predeﬁned sequence type.
The receiver, having knowledge of the
preamble structure, calculates timing metrics using either sliding autocorrelation, characterized
by its low computational load, or diﬀerential correlation having higher complexity yet with more
accurate detection capacities.
The work proposed by Schmidl and Cox (SC) in [15] uses a training symbol with two identical
halves in time domain and estimates the preamble start from the autocorrelation of the received
signal. The two halves of the preamble are made identical (in time domain) by transmitting
randomly generated sequence on the even frequencies while zeros are transmitted on the odd
ones. Transmitted data following the preamble will not be confused with the preamble as all
data must contain odd frequencies. Another method to generate the repetitive structure, is
to straightforward use an IFFT of half the normal size to generate the time domain sample
which has to be repeated (and properly scaled) to form the preamble of two identical parts.
The selection of a particular sequence type should not have much eﬀect on the performance
of the synchronization algorithm. Instead, the training sequence can be chosen on the basis of
being easy to implement or of low PAPR so that there is a little distortion from the transmitter
ampliﬁer.
The received signal is aﬀected in magnitude and phase by the frequency selective channel.
However, the impact of the channel on both preamble halves is the same, assuming that the
channel is constant during the transmission of the preamble (1 symbol duration).
Hence,
multiplying the samples of the ﬁrst preamble half with the complex conjugate of the samples
of the second half, would cancel the channel eﬀect (phase cancelled and magnitude squared).
Therefore, the magnitude of the sum of all the products should be of large value if the summed
terms belong to the preamble, whereas the sum output resulting from the data symbols has
very low values because of the low correlation between shifted samples not belonging to the
50

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
preamble. Let the products sum of each pair of samples be
PSC (d) =
Nu/2−1
X
m=0
r∗
d+mrd+m+Nu/2,
(3.17)
which, for complexity reduction, can be implemented with the recursive formula
PSC (d + 1) = PSC(d) + r∗
d+Nu/2rd+Nu −r∗
drd+Nu/2.
(3.18)
We note that d corresponds to the ﬁrst sample of the observation window. This window slides
along in time as the receiver searches for the preamble, hence the name of sliding-correlation.
In [15], the window size is ﬁxed to Nu/2 samples.
The energy of the received second-half
preamble is given by
RSC(d) =
Nu/2−1
X
m=0
rd+m+Nu/2
2 ,
(3.19)
which also can be evaluated iteratively as done for the correlation function in equation (3.18).
The normalized timing metric can be deﬁned as
MSC (d) = |PSC (d)|2
RSC (d)2 .
(3.20)
The SC metric is depicted in ﬁgure 3.6 under diﬀerent channel conditions. This metric exhibits
a plateau which has a length equal to that of the CP minus the length of the CIR. Due to
the plateau eﬀect, time detection accuracy suﬀers from uncertainty and large TO estimation
variance. To overcome this drawback, Schmidl and Cox propose an averaging method, where
two points to the left and right, which are exactly within 90% of the maximum value, are ﬁrst
found. Then, the timing estimate is taken as the middle of these two points. In this way,
the preamble start estimate is guaranteed to fall within the plateau, yet the accuracy is still
unsatisfactory in terms of providing the maximum tolerance to channel delay spread.
Two timing oﬀset estimators, as modiﬁcations of the previous one [15], have been proposed
by Minn et al. (Minn-A and Minn-B) in [16]. The ﬁrst method, known as sliding window
method (Minn-A), uses the same preamble and proposes two modiﬁcations in the timing metric:
• The ﬁrst modiﬁcation consists in computing the energy denoted by RSWM over the whole
symbol, rather than over the second half in RSC (equation 3.19).
• The second modiﬁcation is averaging the metric over a window of length Ng + 1 instead
51

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
of the 90% averaging scheme.
The Modiﬁed timing metric is then

(3.21)

(3.22)
and
RA(d) =
Nu−1
X
m=0
|rd+m|2 .
(3.23)
The second method, known as training symbol method (Minn-B), uses a training symbol
containing four identical parts of random sequence and inverts the polarity of the two latter
ones. The timing metric has the same form as in the previous ones, yet with diﬀerent correlation
function PB

(3.25)
It is shown in ﬁgure 3.6 that the plateau eﬀect disappears in Minn's methods. Nevertheless, the
obtained correlation peak is not suﬃciently sharp to provide high robustness to noise because
of the wide shape in the ﬁrst modiﬁed metric in equation (3.21) and the side-lobes appearing
around the main peak of the second metric in equation (3.24).
In [17], Minn extends the previous work (Minn-B) by exploiting a preamble of L identical
parts of Golay complementary sequences [91], with certain pattern to give the timing metric
a steeper roll-oﬀtrajectory at the ideal timing position. Golay complementary sequences are
chosen for their speciﬁc correlation properties which translate into a low PAPR value (3 dB)
when they are mapped to the OFDM sub-carriers [94]. The timing estimation metric is based
on the correlation among the L parts of size M samples each. We note that the periodicity of
the training symbol equips timing synchronization with robustness against frequency oﬀsets.
A larger value of L gives a timing metric trajectory with a steeper roll-oﬀ. Some practical L
52

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
values that are used are 4, 8 and 16 parts. The timing oﬀset estimation can be improved by
designing the signs of the identical parts to give the sharpest possible timing metric trajectory.
In this work, both Frequency Domain (FD) OFDM-type preamble and single-carrier-type Time
Domain (TD) preamble are investigated.
Based on the previous framework [16,17], a synchronization technique was proposed in [18]
by Nasir et al., which uses a preamble of eight identical CAZAC sub-sequences to provide
steeper fall oﬀof the timing metric from the strongest correlation point. The choice of CAZAC
sequences is justiﬁed by having unit PAPR [86]. The creation of the eight identical portions
of the preamble is obtained by repeating the FFT of quarter length CAZAC sequence in all
the portions. A speciﬁc sign pattern is also applied to the eight preamble parts. The timing
metric MNa here also corresponds to the correlation function PNa normalized with the energy
RNa as

where b(k) = p(k)p(k +1) for k = 0, 1, . . . , L−2, p(k) for k = 0, 1, . . . , L−1 denote the signs of
the repeated parts of the training symbol. As shown in ﬁgure 3.6, when compared to Minn's
approaches, a steeper fall-oﬀof the timing metric from the strongest correlation point is here
provided and side-lobes problem is avoided.
In [19], Chou et al. proposed time synchronization technique with Zero Padded (ZP) pream-
bles. Two modiﬁed preamble patterns are proposed as modiﬁed versions compared to [15]
and [16] and using almost the same metrics designed to these preambles. The major beneﬁt
of zero padding is to shorten the length of the correlation function for complexity reduction.
These preambles have the potentials to reduce the computational complexity without degrad-
ing the system performance. Indeed, the Nz padding samples in each repetitive part are not
calculated in the correlations function. Therefore, the computation complexity of the estima-
tor can be reduced and the acquiring time of estimation can be decreased. Using the ﬁrst ZP
preamble (based on [15]), the metrics in equations (3.17) and (3.24) are here calculated using
a correlation window of size Nu/2 −Nz. When inserted in the tail of the preamble, the zero
53

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
symbols are duplicated in the CP. If Nz > Ng, the CP becomes a full zero block. This property
can be exploited to eliminate the eﬀect of the plateau of the initial estimator. It is important
to note that very large values of Nz may degrade the system performance in low SNR, while
very short values provides almost the same performance as the initial algorithms. An optimum
value of Nz is ﬁxed to 10% of the repetitive part size (Nu/2 in [15] and Nu/4 in [16]). The
metric of Chou's approach is drawn in ﬁgure 3.6. It is shown that the side-lobes are attenuated
and the metric has almost the same shape as in the technique proposed by Nasir et al. in [18].
Later, a new Precoding Method (PM) was proposed in [21] and [22] for TO and FFO esti-
mation, operating respectively in the AWGN and multipath channels. The preamble symbol
is made from the concatenation of two equal-length sequences s1 and s2 related between them
through diﬀerential modulation as s2 = s1
J c, where c is an adequately designed precoding
sequence and J denotes the element-wise product operator. This structure leads to almost
perfect channel autocorrelation proﬁle with sharp in-phase peak and zero out-of-phase cor-
relation.
Unlike the approaches [15, 16], the choice of the sequences s1 and c is of crucial
importance. They must be judiciously chosen such to have an important correlation property
to provide good detection performance. The m-sequences [80] known by having speciﬁc cor-
relation properties making them suitable for synchronization purpose were considered. The
precoding method uses two m-sequences (s1 and c) to generate the time domain preamble
which consists of the concatenation of s1 and s2. For a judicious choice, a preferred pair of
m-sequences is selected for which the above mentioned correlation property is better veriﬁed
than arbitrary chosen subsequences. To detect the preamble start, the idea is to search for two
strongly correlated symbol halves through the metric
MPM (d) = |PPM (d)|2

(3.29)

where Num = Nu −2 corresponds to the preamble length, which is 2 samples shorter than
the OFDM symbols due to the nature of m-sequences whose length is 2m −1 samples. In this
case, to keep the same length as for OFDM symbols, the CP is appended with 2 samples and

is denoted by Ngm.
The metrics of the previously described DA approaches are illustrated in ﬁgure 3.6. It is
shown that the SC metric [15] exhibits a plateau of length equal to the CP length minus the
channel memory. This plateau disappears in the other methods [16,18,19], but some sidelobes
appear. Due to the multipath eﬀect, the plateau in the CS metric becomes shorter and the
other metrics widen around their maximum, leading to performance degradation and reduced
robustness to noise. The approach in [21] presents a metric with a sharp peak at the correct
preamble start, which is expected to greatly enhance the time synchronization performance.
This peak is attenuated and other side sub-peaks appear in the multipath channel.

Now comparing the illustrative metric curves in ﬁgure 3.6 for preamble based synchroniza-
tion metrics and ﬁgure 3.5 for blind synchronization metric. We observe that in the noiseless
case and at relatively high SNR values, both concepts oﬀer distinguishable reference time index,
which corresponds to the start of each OFDM symbol in the case of NDA approaches while
it corresponds to the preamble start in the DA approaches. Hence, the time synchronization
can be achieved with a minimum of required detection accuracy. However, in practical wireless
communication selective-channel, the blind metric curve is almost deteriorated resulting in a
high symbol start missing rate. In the other hand, data aided metrics always remain able to
discern the preamble among the OFDM data symbols, which justiﬁes their suitability to be
used in broadband communication systems.
3.2.2.3
Frequency Synchronization
Similarly to the symbol timing synchronization, the CFO estimation can be performed either
blindly or exploiting a preamble. It is well known that the blind frequency estimation methods
like [24]- [28] suﬀer from the multipath fading eﬀects, so their performance is usually worse
than that of preamble-based methods in realistic wireless communication environments. Some
well-known preamble-based CFO estimators are brieﬂy reviewed in this section.
Moose [51] proposed an estimator based on the observation of two consecutive identical
symbols. Assuming perfect time synchronization, a ML estimator similar to that in [24] is
proposed for the CFO recovery in the frequency domain after applying the FFT on the received
signal. The acquisition range is limited to the ±1
2 the sub-carrier spacing. It was shown that
it is possible to increase this range through the use of shorter training symbols. For example,
using a training symbol of length equal to half the initial one would double the range of carrier
frequency acquisition. This scheme works well up to a certain point, where the CFO estimate
gets worse as the symbols get shorter.
This is produced because the part of the training
symbols that is cyclically repeated in the CP should be longer than the CIR in order to avoid
ISI, which may deteriorate the step of estimating the frequency oﬀset.
Exploiting the training symbol of two identical parts, Schmidl and Cox [15] showed that
the main diﬀerence between the two halves is a phase shift equal to
φ = π∆fc,
(3.32)
56

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
whose fractional part ν can be calculated exploiting the time estimate in equation (3.20) as
ˆφ = ∠(PCS(ˆτ)),
(3.33)
where ˆτ stands for the preamble start estimate. As |ˆφ| can be guaranteed to be lower than π,
then the FFO estimate is given by
ˆν =
ˆφ
π.
(3.34)
In [52], Morelli and Mengali extended the idea of using repetitive structure exploiting more
than two identical parts. This scheme constructs a number of component estimators based on
diﬀerent pairs of the identical parts in the training symbol. Then it combines these components
using the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) principle. This makes it possible to achieve
better accuracy at the cost of some increase in computational load.
Later, under the assumption of known SNR, Minn et al. [53,54] proposed several methods
to take advantage of the SNR knowledge for further performance improvement based on [52].
Frequency domain, post-FFT ML estimators based on optimal training sequences known at the
receiver, such as the orthogonal sequences with constant modulus, have been proposed in [55]
and [56]. The ﬁrst estimator assumes perfect time synchronization and knowledge of the CIR
to deduce a null subspace based IFO estimator by exploiting the metric below
ˆν = argmin
˜ν

(3.35)
where ¯
WNp+1 stands for the null subspace of W which contains its last Nu −Np + 1 columns,
Dl = diag[sl,0, sl,1, . . . , sl,Nu−1]T and ˜ν ∈[−0.5, 0.5] is the range of the frequency oﬀset ν. To
face the strict requirement of perfect time synchronization, this estimator has been reformu-
lated in [56] to perform joint TO and FO estimation. However, an exhaustive search possible
combination values of ν and τ is required thus leading to high computational load.
Conclusions
In its ﬁrst part, this chapter has investigated the eﬀects of time and frequency synchronization
imperfections on OFDM signal. The types of synchronization errors considered includes time
and frequency oﬀsets. It was shown that time oﬀset introduces interference between adjacent
57

Chapter 3. Synchronization in OFDM Systems: State of the Art
received symbols and between sub-carriers belonging to the same symbols. These interferences
generally result in important performance degradation due to the loss of orthogonality between
sub-carriers. Thus, synchronization is considered as one of the biggest challenges in any OFDM
communication system.
In the second part, a state of art on existing synchronization approaches to combat time and
frequency errors' eﬀects was also provided. Based on the information required for synchroniza-
tion at the receiver end, a classiﬁcation of the synchronization techniques into data-aided and
non-data-aided was adopted. Non data aided, or blind approaches generally exploit the redun-
dancy in the CP or the intrinsic properties in the received signal to provide the synchronization
parameters. Among existing data aided approaches we described some of the preamble based
ones. The considered approaches exploit preambles of speciﬁc structure of either repetitive
parts or parts related between each other. Before describing synchronization approaches, we
have made a brief review on diﬀerent types of sequences that are used for synchronization
purpose. All of the above OFDM synchronization methods are associated with one or more of
the following limitations or drawbacks: lack of robust detection capability in multipath chan-
nel [15], large estimation variance [16], high computational complexity [21,56], channel and/or
SNR knowledge requirement [53]- [55].
To overcome these limitations, we propose in the next chapter an eﬃcient and reduced com-
plexity synchronization approach. Timing synchronization is investigated using one preamble
composed of two identical parts made of either random training sequence or speciﬁc train-
ing sequence with speciﬁc properties. As a byproduct, fractional frequency oﬀset will also be
estimated respecting the algorithm of Schmidl and Cox [15].

Chapter 4
Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization:
Average Performance
In this chapter, we propose two new synchronization techniques for OFDM systems which
exploit a preamble of two identical randomly generated training sub-sequences. The preamble
is sent at the start of the transmission in bursty transmission mode and in a regular manner
in continuous transmission mode. The synchronization process, here, focuses on detecting the
start of the preamble and estimating the fractional part of the carrier frequency oﬀset.
This chapter starts with a description of the synchronization processing in its two versions:
Brute-Force (BF) single-stage and Reduced-Complexity (RC) two-stage proposed in [33, 34].
The BF approach proposes a metric based on diﬀerential correlation that exhibits a high sharp
peak at the start of the preamble. To evaluate the proposed BF approach, theoretical and
experimental performance studies are conducted, ﬁrst developed in the OFDM modulation [36],
and then in the case of DMT modulation [41]. Experimental results are found to agree with
the analytical results reasonably well and conﬁrm both the validity of theoretical performance
study and the relevance of the proposed method in various MCM techniques and channel
conditions.
High detection accuracy is provided by the BF approach at the expense of a huge com-
putational load due to the diﬀerential correlation operations. To overcome this disadvantage,
we suggest to split the BF synchronization processing into two stages. The ﬁrst stage, based
on sliding correlation metric, provides a coarse time estimate around which an uncertainty
59

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
interval is determined. The second stage is based on a diﬀerential correlation carried over the
uncertainty interval. By limiting the uncertainty interval length, an important reduction in the
computational load is realized. The BF single-stage approach, is considered as a benchmark to
assess the performance degradation occasioned by the reduction of complexity characterizing
the proposed RC two-stage approach.
Furthermore, the fractional part of the frequency oﬀset is derived in both the BF and the
RC approaches as an oﬀshoot using the same timing metrics. Its evaluation also shows an
enhancement compared to the considered benchmarks.
Later, to concretize the challenging performance reached in the general MCM systems, the
proposed RC and BF techniques are applied to the IEEE 802.11a/g standards which incorpo-
rate preambles with speciﬁc structures allowing the transposition of the proposed method to
their signals. The aim of this study is to assess the suitability of the proposed techniques be
implemented in the considered standards [39].
4.1
Brute Force Synchronization Approach
The proposed Brute Force (BF) synchronization approach exploits a preamble of length Nu
samples having two identical parts, each composed of Lu = Nu/2 samples. The preamble is
denoted by p = [p0, p1, . . . , pNu−2, pNu−1]. As its halves are identical, the preamble samples
can be denoted as p = [p1, p1] with p1 = [p0, p1, . . . , pLu−1]. Preamble-based synchronization
techniques generally use correlation-based metrics to locate the preamble. Diﬀerent forms of
correlation are used; sliding-correlation as in [15, 16] or diﬀerential-correlation as in [20-22].
Although diﬀerential correlation is costly in terms of computational complexity, it is here
chosen for its high accuracy.
4.1.1
Brute Force Metric
The BF metric performs a diﬀerential correlation along the whole synchronization process.
This processing consists in correlating a diﬀerentially modulated version of the received signal,
which we denote by Y , with a Correlation Sequence (CS) deduced from the preamble sub-
sequence. The CS, which we denote by α, has a length of Lu samples and it is also generated
60

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
through diﬀerential correlation respecting a shift q as follows
α(d) = p∗
dpd+Lu+q = p∗
dpd+q.
(4.1)
The CS α is known at the receiver, where the synchronization processing starts by generating
the new diﬀerentially modulated sequence Y from the received OFDM signal r as
Y (d) = r∗
drd+q.
(4.2)
Then, it multiplies each dth sample of the diﬀerentially modulated sequence Y with the complex
conjugate of the (d mod Lu)th sample of the CS α, sums these products and ﬁnally takes their
squared amplitude normalized by the energy. The BF metric is expressed as
M (d) =
 
|P(d)|
R(d)

,
(4.3)
where

α∗(m)Y (d + m),
(4.4)
and
R(d) =
Lu−1
X
m=0
|Y (d + m)|2 .
(4.5)
The arrival time of the preamble which we denote by τ is deﬁned as τ = t0 + ϵ, where t0
stands for the preamble transmission start time and ϵ is the time propagation delay of the
shortest path, and its estimate ˆτ is selected as the argument d that maximizes the metric M in
equation (4.3). The choice of the correlation shift q is crucial in the proposed metric. Indeed,
for q values equal to 0 or Lu, the metric exhibits a plateau thus penalizing the estimation
accuracy. Yet, any other choice of the shift q ∈[1, Lu −1] provides a metric with high sharp
peak. The metric curve of the BF approach is depicted in ﬁgure 4.1, in which we consider
an OFDM signal with Nu = 1024 sub-carriers, a guard interval of Ng = 102 samples, the
correlation shift q = 1 and random data of length equal to Lu are sent before the preamble.
It is shown that the pronounced peak coincides with the start of the preamble useful part
which provides a high detection accuracy. To assess the performance of the BF approach,
experimental and theoretical results, in both OFDM and DMT modulations, are carried and
presented in the next two sections.

4.1.2
Performance Study of the BF Time Synchronization for OFDM Mod-
ulation
Since the timing metric is used to determine whether a received sample rd coincides with the
preamble start or not, we evaluate the performance of the preamble start estimator through
the criteria of analytical Probability of Correct Detection (PCD) and experimental Correct
Detection Rate (CDR). The PCD is deﬁned as the probability that, for all values of the time
index d, the amplitude of the timing metric M(d) (in equation (4.3)) is lower than that of
M(τ), were τ stands for the correct preamble start. The CDR, is determined through Monte
Carlo simulations and is deﬁned as the rate of trials where the estimated preamble start ˆτ
exactly coincides with the eﬀective preamble start τ (no error tolerance).
4.1.2.1
Probability of Correct Detection
To calculate the PCD of the proposed approach, we ﬁrst need to model and characterize the
timing metric M expressed in (4.3). We do not consider the normalization by the energy in
equation (4.5) and we calculate the metric over an interval of width ∆τ. Substituting (4.1)
and (4.2) in (4.4), the BF metric yields

Now, recalling the expression of the received signal rd in (3.7), in which we consider the
eﬀect of a multipath channel of ﬁnite impulse response length LH, assumed to be shorter than
the CP length Ng, and coeﬃcients denoted by hi, {i = 0, ..., LH −1} (hi is null for i out of
the set of the eﬀective Np paths' positions). The channel also introduces a zero-mean AWGN
with energy Eη. The dth received sample is then expressed as

a) Statistical Analysis
The metric expressed in (4.8) sums up Lu random variables.
Assuming the independence
between the summed terms and for Lu suﬃciently large, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
enables to approximate M(d) by a Gaussian distribution [95]. Consequently, M(d) can be
completely characterized by its mean µd and variance σ2
d, which are hereafter derived.
The mean µd corresponds to the expectation of the metric (E(M(d)). Since sd and ηd are
mutually uncorrelated and ηd is centered, the second and third terms of (4.8) have zero mean.
As ηd is white and q ̸= 0, the last term in (4.8) is also zero mean. Then, the mean value of
63

The expectation in (4.9) is non zero (and hence the mean µ) only for time index d = i = j,
where d coincides with an eﬀective path (hd ̸= 0). Then, the last expression (4.9) becomes

For all the other values of d, the expectation is zero because the samples s∗

sm and s∗

Now, to calculate the variance σ2
d, we ﬁrst need to determine E(|M(d)|2). Once again,
we use the fact that the samples sd and ηd are uncorrelated, which leads to a zero valued
expectation of the cross terms in E(|M(d)|2). This latter is then expressed as

Note that the monopath AWGN channel, reduces to a channel with a single path (LH = 1)
whose gain is h0 = 1.
b) Approximated Probability of Correct Detection
The probability of correct detection is deﬁned as the probability that, for all values of the time
index d within the interval ∆τ, the amplitude of the timing metric |M(d)| is lower than that of
the correct preamble start |M(τ)|. Let us denote the value of |M(τ)| (at the correct preamble
start) by ε. Now assuming the independence between the diﬀerent values of |M(d)| and |M(τ)|
for d ̸= τ, the probability of correct detection is expressed as
PCD =

(4.15)
where Fd(ε) stands for the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the metric at the time
index d and Pd(ε) stands for the Probability Density Function (PDF) of |M(d)|.
For notational convenience, we introduce the random discrete variable X, corresponding to
|M(d)|. We recall that X is non-uniformly Gaussian distributed. The CDF is calculated for
positive values of ε because we consider the metric amplitude. The CDF Fd in the probability
expression (4.15) is determined as follows

To evaluate the integral in the equation above (eq. (4.17)), we use the Marcum Q function

The performance of the BF synchronization scheme is considered in the AWGN and multipath
channels over a practical SNR range. The interval ∆τ, over which the metric evaluation is
carried, is set to Ng. Under the assumption that the samples are modeled as independent

where ˜Np corresponds to the set of Np eﬀective paths (with non-zero gain). In (4.20), for d out
of the set of channel eﬀective paths, Fd can be chosen arbitrarily from any of the time indexes,
as they are identically distributed (d ∈∆τ \ ˜Np).
For the experimental evaluation, we use Matlab simulations and average over 104 Monte
Carlo trials for an OFDM system with Lu = 29 = 512, Ng = 102 and we set the correlation
shift q to 1. The preamble training sequence is generated randomly and, like the data symbols,
it is taken from QPSK modulation. We evaluate the approximated PCD (4.20) for the AWGN
and multipath channels. The considered multipath channel has 7 paths (Np = 7) uniformly
separated by 6 samples and an exponential power delay proﬁle. Consequently, the channel
impulse response length is LH = 42 samples. The ratio of the ﬁrst path to the last path is set
to 12 dB with regular adjacent paths gain ratio.
Figure 4.2: Probability/rate of correct detection of the preamble start for OFDM modulation.
Figure 4.2 illustrates the probability of correct detection in the considered channels. As
shown in the ﬁgure, in the AWGN channel, the analytical probability concords perfectly with
the simulated one. In the multipath channel, the experimental curve matches the numerical
curve very well for SNR values lower than −6 dB and higher than −3 dB. In between, the
theoretically approximated values of the PCD are very close to the experimental values. A
very slight gap of about 0.1 dB emerges. This gap may be related to the validity limits of
the assumption of independence between the timing metric values, which may be corrupted in
the case of multipath channel due to the channel memory. Roughly, the good match obtained
67

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
between the theoretical and the experimental results proves that the assumptions made in the
analysis are valid and the simulation results conﬁrm the theoretical analysis.
It is worth to note that both of the analytical and the experimental results prove the eﬃ-
ciency of the proposed synchronization technique. Indeed, as shown in ﬁgure 4.2, the preamble
start detection becomes perfect (PCD= 1 and CDR=1) from SNR values of −5 dB and −1 dB
in the AWGN and multipath channels respectively. These results show a very good robustness
to noise eﬀects for both channels. This is obtained thanks to the diﬀerential correlation which
however, as will be shown later, leads to high computational load. The relevance of the BF
approach is also assessed in the case of DMT modulation which presents some speciﬁcities
when compared to the above OFDM case study.
4.1.3
Performance Study of the BF Time Synchronization for DMT Mod-
ulation
The Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) modulation technique is considered as the baseband and wired
version of the OFDM technique. Similarly to the OFDM technique, the DMT technique splits
the channel into Nu equally spaced sub-channels and transmits data in parallel over these
non-overlapped narrow-band sub-channels. If the DMT signal contains Nu/2 sub-carriers, the
discrete time signal can be obtained from a Nu-point IFFT [97]. Denoting ck = ak + jbk the
constellation point that modulates the kth tone, k = 1, 2, ..., Nu/2 −1, during the lth DMT
symbol, then sl is expressed as
sl =
Nu−1
X
k=0
ckej2πkl/Nu.
(4.21)
In order to generate a real signal, the symbols fed to the IFFT must satisfy: cNu−k = c∗
k on
each tone k, k = Nu/2 + 1, ..., Nu −1. For DMT systems, data symbols are also extended with
a CP.
The eﬀect of synchronization errors in DMT systems was analyzed in [97], which are almost
the same as in the case of OFDM technique.
The main diﬀerence is that the channel is
invariant, thus eliminating the Doppler eﬀects and the transmission is baseband which avoids
any frequency oﬀset. Having almost the same properties, DMT systems also require accurate
synchronization to obtain satisfactory performance. This issue was studied in many works [98]-
[100] either in the general case of the DMT modulation technique or respecting a standard. In
68

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed BF approach for the DMT modulation
in terms of probability of preamble start correct detection. Indeed, the closed form analytical
expression of the PCD is derived and compared to the experimental CDR.
4.1.3.1
Probability of Correct Detection
We consider the timing metric expressed in (4.6), which sums Lu random variables and with
distribution approximated by a Gaussian distribution respecting the CLT, assuming the inde-
pendence of the metric M(d) Lu summed terms. The same trend as envisaged in the OFDM
case is here followed to derive the mean µd and the variance σ2
d of M(d). Regarding the detailed
expression in (4.8), since sd and ηd are mutually uncorrelated, the second and third terms in
(4.8) have zero-mean. As ηd is white and q ̸= 0, the last term of (4.8) is also zero mean. Then,
M(d) reduces to the same expression as in the case of OFDM in equation (4.9). Diﬀerently,
here for real-valued received signal, the mean µd which corresponds to the expectation of the
timing metric is expressed as
E(|M(d)|) =
Lu−1

(4.22)
We note that, like the case of OFDM metric, for the values of d that correspond to an eﬀective
path (d = i = j), the expectation is not zero-valued. For the other values of d, the expecta-
tion is not zero-valued only when their q-shifted indexes also correspond to an eﬀective path.
Otherwise, the mean µd is null.
To calculate E(|M(d)|2), we use once again the fact that sd and ηd are uncorrelated which
leads to a zero-valued expectation of the cross terms of E(|M(d)|2) expressed in (4.11). Ex-
ploiting the same properties of uncorrelation between samples and the fact that the noise is
centered, E(|M(d)|2) can be further simpliﬁed. Hence, for d values coinciding with an eﬀective

mean and variance formulas' in equations (4.22) and (4.25), respectively.
4.1.3.2
Numerical and Simulation Results
As we consider real-valued signal, the performance is averaged over random preambles taken
from BPSK and we consider both AWGN and multipath channels. In addition to the multipath
channel used in the evaluation for the OFDM case (channel with 7 paths), we consider another
multipath channel with 5 paths uniformly separated by 6 samples. Consequently, the channel
impulse response lengths is LH = 30 samples.
The power delay proﬁle of the channel is
exponential and the ratio of the ﬁrst path to the last path is set to 12 dB with regular adjacent
path gain ratio. The other parameters' values are kept unchanged.
Figure 4.3 illustrates the PCD in the considered channels: AWGN, Chan.I (5 path) and
Chan.II (7 path). Again, the proposed BF approach is shown to provide very accurate preamble
start detection and can be applied for synchronization in multi-carrier systems with low over-
70

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
head. Indeed, simulation results show that in the multipath channels, the detection becomes
perfect from SNR values of −3.5 dB and 2 dB in the case of Chan.I and Chan.II respectively.
We note that, as for the OFDM case, such good accuracy is obtained at the expense of high
computational load, which will be evaluated later. It is also shown in the ﬁgure that, in the
AWGN channel, the analytical probability concords perfectly with the experimental one and
from an SNR of −5 dB, the detection becomes perfect (PCD=1). We note that in both of the
multipath channels, the experimental curves match the numerical curves very well, for an SNR
lower than −6 dB and higher than −2 dB. In between, the theoretical probability is very close
to the experimental rate and a slight gap emerges which becomes a little higher as the channel
memory widens. The gap between the analytical and the experimental results may be related
to the validity limits of some assumptions such as the independence between the timing metric
values for diﬀerent indexes (used as in the case of OFDM modulation to approximate the PCD
expression).
Figure 4.3: Probability/rate of correct detection of the preamble start for DMT modulation.
Thanks to the pronounced peak appearing in the BF metric shape, the preamble start de-
tection is greatly accurate. However, the BF metric is very costly in terms of computational
complexity due to the diﬀerential correlation operations that require Lu−1 complex multiplica-
tions per correlation evaluation. Indeed, in the bursty packet transmission mode, the receiver
has to carry synchronization processing continuously, which results in a huge computational
load. The continuous transmission mode, in the other hand, allows to reduce the complexity
as the preamble is periodically sent such that the synchronization treatment is carried over a
71

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
limited interval, intimately related to preamble periodicity. For practical implementation and
fast acquisition, the computational complexity must be as low as possible. To take advan-
tage from the accuracy provided by the BF metric while reducing the incurred computational
load, we suggest to minimize the number of diﬀerential correlation operations carried during
the synchronization process. To this end, we propose to proceed into two stages; namely a
reduced-complexity coarse stage followed by a high-complexity ﬁne stage, carried over a short
interval around the coarse time estimate as described in the next section.
4.2
Reduced-Complexity Synchronization Approach
The purpose of the Reduced-Complexity (RC) two-stage approach is to lessen the complexity of
the diﬀerential correlation based processing performed in the BF metric. By combining sliding
and diﬀerential correlations and splitting the synchronization processing into two stages, we
show that the computational load can be greatly reduced while keeping high detection accuracy.
The ﬁrst coarse stage requires a preamble of two identical parts and, based on sliding correlation
as in [15], it ﬁnds out a short uncertainty interval over which the second ﬁne stage is performed
based on diﬀerential correlation. The combined use of the sliding correlation, characterized
by its low complexity (1 complex multiplication per correlation step), and the diﬀerential
correlation, which is much more complex (Lu −1 complex multiplications per correlation step),
carried over a short interval results in an overall reduced complexity approach.
4.2.1
Coarse Synchronization Stage
This stage aims to provide a coarse time estimate ˆτc near the true preamble start time τ,
which we consider as a reference point around which the uncertainty interval will be set.
The uncertainty interval which we denote by ∆τ is deﬁned as the interval around which the
diﬀerential correlation should be carried during second stage, referred to as ﬁne stage.
Similarly to the conventional synchronization algorithms [15,18,19], the coarse stage of the
proposed RC approach exploits the repetitive structure of the preamble to provide the coarse
estimate ˆτc. Respecting [15], it ﬁrst operates a sliding correlation, which is computationally
simple, with a delay equal to the preamble training sub-sequence length Lu as in equation
(3.17). It is obvious in ﬁgure 4.4, that the obtained timing metric, drawn for the same system
72

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
parameters as in section 4.1.1, is similar to that of [15] and it exhibits a plateau whose length
is equal to the CP length Ng minus the channel impulse response time spread τmax −τmin.
To cope with the plateau eﬀect, the middle point dopt of the plateau located at 90% of the
absolute metric maximum value is ﬁrst selected. Then, a time interval of Ng/2 is added to the
obtained time instant dopt to determine the coarse preamble start estimate (ˆτc = dopt + Ng/2).
To ﬁne tune the coarse estimate, we opt for the second stage, which is based on diﬀerential
correlation known by its accuracy.
4.2.2
Fine Synchronization Stage
The coarse stage may guarantee that the coarse time estimate ˆτc falls within the ISI free
part of the preamble, but the tolerance to errors decreases as the channel impulse response
widens. To get an estimation with a larger tolerance, we opt for the ﬁne stage which provides
a more accurate time estimation. The ﬁne metric is calculated respecting the BF metric as
in equation (4.3) which involves the previously introduced correlation sequence α in equation
(4.1), generated from the preamble, and the diﬀerentially modulated sequence Y in equation
(4.2) generated from the received signal.
The main diﬀerence between the BF metric and the ﬁne metric of the RC approach is that
the latter one is carried over the short-length uncertainty interval ∆τ centered on the coarse
estimate ˆτc. Hence, the time index d in equation (4.3) spans the interval [ˆτc−∆τ/2+1, ˆτc+∆τ/2]
and in equation (4.2), it varies within the interval [ˆτc −∆τ/2+1, ˆτc +∆τ/2+Lu]. The larger is
∆τ, the more accurate is the time estimation expected to be more complex is the processing.
This implies a trade-oﬀbetween complexity and accuracy.
The interval length ∆τ can be
chosen either as a function of Ng or related to the standard deviation of ˆτc at the worst
operating SNR. By choosing an uncertainty interval shorter than the standard deviation of the
coarse estimate, the eﬀective preamble start may be missed.
Figure 4.4 illustrates the coarse and ﬁne timing metrics of the proposed RC synchronization
technique using the system parameters speciﬁed in section 4.1.1 (Ns = 1126, Lu = 29 = 512,
Ng = 102 and q = 1). Obviously, the coarse metric of the RC approach has the same shape as
the metric initially proposed by Schmidl and Cox [15] which exhibits a plateau of length equal
to Ng (in memoryless channel), while the ﬁne metric of the RC approach is identical to that
of the BF approach, thus leading to an accurate preamble start detection.

4.2.3
Relevance of the RC Time Synchronization: Accuracy and Complex-
ity
The performance of the proposed BF approach was shown to provide satisfactory detection
accuracy with high probability of correct detection proved through analytical and experimental
studies previously presented in section 4.1.2. As the RC approach uses the BF metric in its
ﬁne stage, we expect to get close detection accuracy. To shed light on the performance of the
proposed RC approach, we here evaluate it and compare it to existing approaches. We also
assess the computational load required to achieve synchronization in the proposed approaches
and the considered benchmarks.
4.2.3.1
Detection Accuracy
In this section we evaluate the performance of the proposed RC technique and compare it to
the considered benchmarks in the case of monopath AWGN and multipath channels. The BF
approach, where diﬀerential correlation is exclusively used, is also considered as a benchmark to
assess the performance degradation occasioned by the reduction of complexity characterizing
the proposed two-stage RC approach.
The evaluation is also investigated through Matlab
simulations using the same system parameters and channels speciﬁed in section 4.1.2.2. The
74

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
time estimation performance is evaluated in terms of both Correct Detection Rate (CDR) of
the preamble start, as previously deﬁned, and its estimation variance. The variance evaluates
the ﬂuctuation of the time estimate ˆτ around the mean value, thus giving a complementary
information about the error magnitude. The proposed techniques are compared to the following
benchmarks: Schmidl and Cox (SC) [15], Minn-A [16], Minn-B [16], Nasir [18], Chou [19], and
the Precoding Method (PM) [21].
In [18], the zero-padding spreads along 7Nu/8 adjacent
samples.
Figure 4.5 illustrates the CDR and estimation variance of the compared approaches in the
case of monopath AWGN channel. The CDR (ﬁgure 4.5.a) shows that at very low SNR, the PM
and the BF methods give the best time detection that attains a CDR of 100% at −6 dB. From a
target correct detection rate of 30% to 95%, the RC method presents a slight degradation lower
than 1 dB compared to the best benchmark (PM and BF methods), yet with an important
reduction in complexity. Beyond an SNR of −6 dB, these three methods provide an almost
perfect detection. The SC approach proposed in [15] gives the worst detection rate due to
the plateau eﬀect that induces an uncertainty on the preamble start estimate. Thanks to the
zero-padding insertion in the preamble of the Chou's method proposed in [19], the preamble
start detection is greatly enhanced compared to the SC method. Both of the methods proposed
by Minn et al. in [16] (Minn-A and Minn-B) outperform it, but the detection accuracy is still
lower than the diﬀerential correlation based methods (PM, BF and RC).
The variance of the preamble start estimate is depicted in ﬁgure 4.5.b. We note that around
−10 dB, the variances of all compared estimators are comparable and have high values of about
104 squared samples, at the exception of Chou's method which has the highest variance (more
than 105). For higher SNR values, all estimators' variances decline. The PM, BF and RC
methods give the lowest variances that vanish at SNRs of −5 dB, −4 dB and 0 dB, respectively.
Consistently with the CDR criterion, the method of SC gives the worst performance and is
outperformed by Chou's and Minn's methods.
The performance of the approaches cited above are depicted in ﬁgure 4.6 in the case of
multipath channel. The preamble start CDR presented in ﬁgure 4.6.a shows that the diﬀerential
correlation based approaches (PM, BF, RC) provide the best CDR which reaches a rate of 100%
at an SNR of about 0 dB. We note that the RC approach provides approximately the same time
detection performance with an important gain in terms of complexity reduction, compared to
the BF approach. For the considered SNR range, the sliding correlation based approaches
75

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
(a) Correct Detection Rate
(b) Preamble start estimation variance

provide lower rates and saturate well below the 100% best rate. Nasir's method presents a
maximum target of correct detection of 64%, Minn-B has a maximum target of about 25%,
Minn-A reaches 12%. The SC method gives the worst rate due to the plateau eﬀect as in the
case of AWGN channel.
Figure 4.6.b presents the variances of the time estimates. At very low SNR (−10 dB), all
estimation variances are comparable with high values between 104 and 105 squared samples.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the diﬀerential correlation based methods outperform the sliding cor-
relation ones, by providing the lowest estimation variance that vanishes at 4 dB, 1 dB and 4
dB for respectively the BF approach, the PM approach and the RC one. The BF approach
gives a slightly lower estimation variance than the RC approach, at the expense of a higher
complexity. The diﬀerence between the RC and BF curves at SNR values between −5 dB and 0
dB is indeed related to the reduced length of the interval over which the ﬁne stage is performed.
In accordance with the previous results, the curves of the sliding correlation based estimators
go on declining and present a ﬂoor at about 1 squared sample for both Minn's method and 0.1
squared sample for Nasir's one.
The simulation carried in both AWGN and multipath channel showed the robustness of the
proposed BF and RC techniques revealed in an important gain in terms of detection accuracy,
when compared to conventional approaches. This improvement is mainly due to the use of
diﬀerential correlation, which results in a huge computational complexity. However, the use
of a ﬁrst computationally simple stage and a second complex one, over a limited interval,
76

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
(a) Correct Detection Rate
(b) Preamble start estimation variance
Figure 4.6: Preamble start estimate performance in a multipath channel with 7 paths.
results in an overall simple approach. The proposed RC approach was shown to provide the
best tradeoﬀbetween complexity and detection accuracy. Indeed, it achieves almost equal
performance to the diﬀerential correlation based approaches with a much lower complexity,
equivalent to that of the sliding correlation based approaches, whose performance are however
signiﬁcantly lower. Next, we evaluate the complexity of the proposed techniques as well as the
considered benchmark.
4.2.3.2
Computational Complexity
To shed light on the low complexity of the proposed RC approach, we compare its complexity
to the considered benchmarks including the proposed BF. To this aim we assess the total
Number of Complex Multiplication (NCM) operations required to achieve synchronization.
In the proposed diﬀerential correlation based approaches, we determine the instantaneous
NCM required to calculate M(d) in equation (4.3). This latter is the sum of Lu terms involving
samples taken from the sequence Y in equation (4.2). Hence, an amount of Lu −1 complex
multiplication operations is required for each time index d.
The complexity of the metric
M rises as the window search widens. For the BF approach, it is calculated continuously in
the case of bursty packet transmission mode, while it is calculated over a chosen number of
symbols around the expected preamble arrival time in the continuous mode. Whereas, for RC
77

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
approach and in both transmission modes, the metric is calculated over the uncertainty interval
∆τ of short length, each time the ﬁne metric has to be computed resulting on ∆τ(Lu −1)
complex multiplication operations. In the sliding correlation based approach [15], and thanks
to the recursive implementation depicted in (3.18), the computational complexity required
to calculate the metric in equation (3.20) reduces to 1 complex multiplication.
The other
approaches [16, 18, 19], respect the same framework yet using diﬀerent window sizes for the
same system parameters resulting in more or less diﬀerent computational load and detection
accuracy.
Let us consider a transmission scenario, for numerical complexity evaluation, in which we
aim to derive the NCM carried to detect the ﬁrst preamble for all the algorithms of interest. The
NCM required by the estimation methods considered are presented in table 4.1. The parameter
Q denotes the time interval between the processing beginning and the ﬁrst preamble arrival,
MN denotes the size, in samples, of the repetitive part in the preamble of Nasir's approach [18]
and Nz is the size, in samples, of the zero padded part in Chou's approach [19]. The numerical
example for the complexities is also given for the same system parameters in section 4.1.2.2.
An interval Q of 3 OFDM symbols is chosen, Nz = Nu/8 which provides the steepest roll-
oﬀof the metric and MN = Nu/8. Table 4.1 shows that the method proposed by Chou et
al. has the lowest computational load. The PM and the BF methods present the highest
complexity. In between, the methods of Schmidl and Cox, Minn, Nasir and the RC approach
have a relatively low complexity with an important accuracy enhancement realized by the RC
approach as shown in section 4.2.3.1 through simulations.

T), the synchronization processing will be performed periodically resulting in an important
complexity reduction for all the algorithms. In the case of the bursty packet transmission,
where the synchronization processing must continuously be performed (e.g. WiFi), the PM
and the BF approaches are penalized by the extremely high complexity. The RC approach
provides the best compromise between complexity and performance, as it has a computational
load almost equal to that required by the sliding correlation based approaches and an accuracy
almost equal to that provided by the other diﬀerential correlation based approaches.
4.2.4
Frequency Oﬀset Estimation
For the frequency synchronization, we are interested in only the fractional part of the carrier
frequency oﬀset, which is here derived as a byproduct of the ﬁne timing metric, which also
corresponds to the BF metric. The conventional approaches which use preambles of repetitive
structure, generally exploit the diﬀerence between the preamble repetitive parts at the receiver,
which may be a sign pattern [17,52] or a phase shift [15], to estimate the FFO. In our work, the
FFO estimation can be achieved by evaluating the phase of the correlation function in equation
(4.4) at the preamble start estimate ˆτf, similarly to [15]. When multiplying the conjugate of
a sample in the ﬁrst preamble half to its corresponding sample in the second half, the channel
eﬀect is cancelled and the multiplication output corresponds to a phase shift equal to πν.
Hence, the FFO estimate is determined as
ˆν = 1
π∠P( ˆτf),
(4.26)
where ∠denotes the phase operator. The estimation range allows for the recovery of an FFO
up to twice the sub-carriers spacing.
To evaluate the performance of the FFO estimation, we assess its Mean Squared Error
(MSE) under the two diﬀerent AWGN and multipath channel models, previously described,
and using the same system parameters as in sections 4.2.3.1 and 4.1.2.2 for the evaluation of the
time estimation performance. We recall that the multipath channel has 7 paths and a memory
length of 42 samples, thus accumulating an interference till 40% of the CP length of adjacent
symbols. The multipath channel has an exponential power delay proﬁle where the ratio of the
ﬁrst path to the last path is set to 12 dB, with a regular adjacent paths gains ratio of 2 dB.
The symbol length Nu is of 1024 samples to which a CP of length Ng = 102 samples is added.
79

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
The FFO value is set to 0.4 sub-carrier spacing. The proposed estimator is evaluated through
the RC and the BF schemes and is compared to those of SC [15], Minn-A [16], Minn-B [16],
and the PM [21].
(a) AWGN channel
(b) Multipath channel (7 paths)
Figure 4.7: Mean Squared Error of the FFO estimate in the case of SISO OFDM system.
Simulation results, presented in ﬁgure 4.7, ensure the robustness of most of the compared
estimators in both AWGN and multipath channels. In the AWGN channel, the diﬀerential
correlation based estimators have almost the same MSE that declines continuously to reach
10−6 at an SNR of 25 dB. Below an SNR value of -5 dB, all methods provide close MSE values
around 0.1 with slightly higher error for the RC approach. Above an SNR of -5 dB, the PM, RC
and BF methods give approximately the same MSE values allowing a slight gain of about 1 dB
compared to the sliding correlation based methods (Minn-A and SC). The latter estimators, in
the multipath channel, provide worse MSE and achieve a loss of about 3 dB compared to the
diﬀerential correlation based estimators. This result is expected due to the plateau eﬀect that
greatly degrades the detection performance in the multipath channels. The estimator Minn-B
gives the worst MSE that presents a ﬂoor at an error of about 4 10−2 from SNR values equal
to -5 dB and 0 dB in the AWGN and multipath channels, respectively.
For both time and the frequency synchronization, the proposed BF and RC techniques were
shown to enhance the estimation performance. To provide more insights in the performance
of the proposed synchronization techniques, we evaluate their performance for time synchro-
nization in a standardized OFDM system, respecting the IEEE 802.11a/g speciﬁcations.

Application to the IEEE 802.11a/g Standards
One of the most popular standards in use today is IEEE 802.11 and its variations adopted
in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN). Like all OFDM systems, WLAN receivers require
accurate synchronization to demodulate the received symbols.
To this aim, the standard
speciﬁes a preamble of distinguished repetitive structure. This latter is exploited and adapted
to the herein proposed BF and RC synchronization techniques.
4.3.1
State of the Art of Synchronization in the IEEE 802.11a/g
Among the WLAN standards we here study the IEEE 802.11a/g speciﬁed in [103] and [104],
which support a data rate up to 54 Mb/s and operate in the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands re-
spectively in a bursty transmission mode, are here considered. The synchronization process
in IEEE 802.11a/g standards exploits a preamble known at the receiver, The timing synchro-
nization process is split into an initial coarse synchronization stage (packet detection) and a
later ﬁne one (frame start detection). A coarse metric, based on autocorrelating the received
signal, is used for packet detection. For the frame start detection, a ﬁne metric based on cross-
correlating the received signal with the short preamble symbol is carried. In the remaining
of this section, we ﬁrst provide a short description of the preamble used for synchronization.
Then, synchronization issues are discussed in existing approaches.
4.3.1.1
Preamble Structure
In order to accomplish synchronized reception, a preamble that has been carefully designed to
provide enough information for a good synchronization performance is sent at the beginning of
each transmitted packet. It consists of two parts: the ﬁrst part has 10 short repeated symbols
and the second part has two long repeated symbols, as illustrated in ﬁgure 4.8. The short
training symbols are denoted by t1 to t10, each of length D = 16 samples (0.8µs each), whereas
T1 and T2 denote the long training symbols, of length 64 samples each (3.2µs each), preceded
by a 32-sample CP (1.6µs) resulting in a total preamble length of 320 samples (16µs). The
preamble is followed by the signal ﬁeld and data.
The preamble illustrated in ﬁgure 4.8 is dedicated to various reception tasks, including
81

frame synchronization, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) level setting, carrier frequency oﬀset
estimation and symbol timing synchronization and channel estimation [103]. We here focus
on time synchronization by exploiting the repetitive structure speciﬁcity of either the short
training symbols or the long ones.
4.3.1.2
Literature Review of Synchronization in the Standards IEEE 802.11a/g
Many synchronization techniques, originally proposed for general OFDM systems [15]- [17]
can be applied to IEEE 802.11a/g WLANs. However, these techniques may lead to unsatis-
factory performance especially in the presence of multipath eﬀects. Other techniques that are
speciﬁcally designed for IEEE 802.11a/g WLANs have been reported in [106]- [109]. In this
section, we describe the synchronization processing adopted in the standard and the optimized
algorithm proposed in [107], which we hereafter consider as benchmarks.
According to the standards IEEE 802.11a/g, the received signal is ﬁrst autocorrelated with
a delay of D samples to roughly localize the preamble using the metric

(4.27)
Once the receiver has detected the arrival of a preamble corresponding to the start of a packet,
the symbol timing algorithm reﬁnes the estimate to sample-level precision. To this aim, the
local known repetitive short symbol t (among the 10 short symbols) is used to perform cross-
correlation as

As shown in ﬁgure 4.9, the autocorrelation of the received signal in equation (4.27) exhibits
a plateau whose length equals the length of 9 short symbols, whereas the cross-correlation with
the known short symbol t1 in equation (4.28) presents peaks at the start of each short symbol.
As the ﬁrst 9 correlation peaks are within the plateau, the last 10th peak is used as the beacon
position from which the next symbol starts.
Figure 4.9: Coarse and ﬁne timing metrics of the IEEE 802.11a/g using short symbols under
noiseless conditions.
In [107], symbol timing synchronization algorithms for OFDM system based on IEEE
802.11a were put forward.
Some of them are based on energy detection and other based
on cross-correlation that exploits the repetitive structure of the preamble. Among them, we
choose as benchmark an optimized algorithm that uses one period of short training symbol in
the IEEE 802.11a preamble. As the real part of the former 8 data and the imaginary part of
the latter 8 data in each short symbol tn are identical [103], the algorithm in [107] decreases the
period of short training symbol to 8 sampling points. The metric proposed by this algorithm
is given by

4.3.2
BF and RC Synchronization in the IEEE 802.11a/g
We here focus on the suitability of the proposed techniques to time synchronization for the
standards IEEE 802.11a/g. Indeed, the repetitive structure of the short and long preamble
symbols allows a ﬂexible synchronization processing, respecting the proposed techniques which
require such structure. Even if the two IEEE 802.11a/g preamble parts (short and long sym-
bols) can be exploited, we consider the ﬁrst preamble part composed of 10 short symbols to
achieve an early time synchronization, thus allowing the processing of the other tasks (carrier
frequency oﬀset estimation, channel estimation) that use the second preamble part and must
be carried after time synchronization. In this case, depending on the length of the adopted
repetitive part Lu and consequently the correlation delay, the coarse metric (3.20) and the BF
metric (ﬁne RC) (4.3) exhibit diﬀerent shapes.
Figure 4.10 illustrates the BF and RC (coarse and ﬁne) timing metrics. We note, in ﬁgure
4.10.(a), that using a length Lu = 5D without considering any CP, the coarse metric has a
triangular shape exhibiting a single peak. This latter corresponds to the start of the preamble
that we consider as a coarse time estimate ˆτc around which the ﬁne metric of the RC approach
is carried over a limited interval of length 2D. The ﬁne metric leads to a high sharp peak at
the time index ˆτf, which also corresponds to the time estimate ˆτ of the BF approach. In ﬁgure
4.10.(b), we consider the ﬁrst 2 short symbols as a CP whose length is Ng = 2D and a useful
part composed of two identical parts, each of length Lu = 4D. The coarse time estimate ˆτc is
selected as described in section 4.2.1. The estimated time ˆτf provided by the peak value of the
ﬁne metric here indicates the start of the 3rd short symbol corresponding to the useful part
of the preamble. We notice that, going on calculating the coarse metric, the long symbol also
allows a synchronization respecting the proposed techniques for Lu = 4D.

We consider the cases of AWGN and exponential power delay proﬁle multipath channels.
Two multipath channels are used, having respectively 4 and 6 uniformly spaced paths with
regular normalized path delays of 4 and 2 samples, resulting in a channel memory length of 16
samples for both channels. The ratio of the ﬁrst path to the last path is set to 15 dB with a
constant adjacent path gains ratio. The uncertainty interval ∆τ is set to twice the CP length
(32 samples). The performance is here evaluated in terms of Correct Detection Rate (CDR),
as previously deﬁned (ˆτf = τ, no error tolerance). Respecting the proposed arrangement of
85

the preamble (No CP and two identical parts of length 5D each), τ coincides with the start of
the second short training symbol as presented in ﬁgure 4.10.(a). In addition to the proposed
BF and RC approaches, we consider as benchmark the SC algorithm [15] (also corresponding
to the coarse synchronization), the IEEE 802.11a/g standards synchronization approach and
the optimized algorithm proposed [107], which are recalled in section 4.3.1.2. It is worth to
note that in the simulation we tolerate an error of 2 samples for only the SC approach, which
has poor detection performance.
Figure 4.11 presents the CDR in the monopath AWGN channel. As in the general case of
OFDM systems, the considered BF and RC approaches provide satisfactory detection accuracy
and outperform the considered benchmarks. Indeed, even at low SNR (< 0 dB) the detection
is good and it becomes perfect (CDR=100%) above an SNR of 1 dB. For SNR values lower
than 8 dB, the proposed techniques outperforms the standard and they realize a gain of about
7 dB for a target CDR of about 90%. Compared to the BF and RC approaches, the optimized
algorithm provides lower detection rate for all SNR ranges, but for a very low SNR (< −2
dB) it outperforms the standard. The SC approach provides the worst detection rate and its
curve stagnates at a target CDR of about 90%, reached from an SNR of 15 dB. We note that
the proposed BF and RC approaches are beneﬁcial especially at low SNR values. Yet, the RC
approach is more advantageous thanks to its relatively reduced complexity.

Figures 4.12.a and 4.12.b show the CDR of the previously cited approaches achieved in the
multipath channels. We note that, due to the multipath eﬀect, the detection accuracy of all
the considered approaches is degraded. Under the same conditions, the RC and BF approaches
achieve more or less the same detection performance and outperform the other techniques. The
capability of the optimized algorithm is not as satisfactory as the standardized algorithm, but
it outperforms the SC approach.

To shed light on the diﬀerence between the proposed BF and RC approaches performance,
we draw the probability of missing the preamble start in ﬁgure 4.13. We note that the accuracy
provided by both approaches is almost the same except for some SNR ranges where a slight
gap of about 0.5 dB emerges. It is worth to mention that, in some cases, the RC approach
outperforms the BF one, which is not expected. This may be related to the fact that calculating
the BF metric over a longer interval (which is the case of the BF approach) results in a higher
probability to detect a false peak.
The simulation carried to evaluate the proposed BF and RC synchronization techniques
proved their relevance in both AWGN and multipath channels and showed that they outperform
the synchronization processing speciﬁed by the IEEE 802.11a/g standards and other algorithms
considered as benchmark [15,107]. Moreover, as indicated before, the two-stage RC approach
has a low computational load at the expense of a slight accuracy loss, which makes it suitable
for fast symbol timing synchronization in bursty IEEE 802.11a/g systems.

Conclusions
In this chapter, we proposed two eﬃcient preamble-based synchronization approaches for
OFDM systems.
A brute force single-stage approach based exclusively on diﬀerential cor-
relation was ﬁrst presented. Its analytical performance was provided to assess the detection
accuracy and was validated through experimental results. This study was carried for both
OFDM and DMT modulation techniques and the performance was improved in both AWGN
and multipath channels. The brute force approach was shown to provide very accurate detec-
tion performance, yet at the expense of important computational complexity.
To reduce the complexity occasioned by the diﬀerential correlation operations, we suggested
the two-stage reduced-complexity method, wherein the ﬁrst stage a sliding correlation, of low
computational load, is used to provide a coarse time estimate. Then, a second stage, based on
diﬀerential correlation carried over a limited range around the coarse time estimate, is used
to detect the ﬁne preamble start. This combination yields to an overall reduced complexity
approach. The simulation results conducted under various channel conditions conﬁrmed the
good performance of the proposed RC approach with respect to existing techniques. This eval-
uation also covers the computational load. In particular, we evaluated the number of complex
88

Chapter 4. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Average Performance
multiplications required to detect the ﬁrst sent preamble. We have shown that the proposed
two-stage reduced-complexity technique oﬀers the best trade-oﬀbetween complexity and de-
tection performance. Indeed, it provides almost the same detection accuracy of exclusively
diﬀerential correlation based techniques with a complexity more or less equivalent to that of
the sliding correlation based ones. As a byproduct, the fractional frequency oﬀset estimation
was also assessed and it was shown to provide satisfactory accuracy.
Finally, by exploiting the repetitive structure of the preamble used in the standards IEEE
802.11a/g, we proved that the proposed techniques are able to work well in these standards
and that they outperform the synchronization processing speciﬁed by the IEEE 802.11a/g
standards and other existing algorithms considered as benchmarks.

Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization:
Optimized Performance
This chapter studies two optimization issues of the proposed reduced-complexity synchroniza-
tion technique described in chapter 4. The ﬁrst issue concerns the choice of the preamble
training sub-sequence, deﬁned in the time domain, and the length of the uncertainty interval.
The evaluated training sub-sequences belong to a set of binary m-sequences, Gold and Kasami
sequences. We start by analyzing the detection accuracy provided through the use of diﬀerent
binary pseudo-noise sequences. Secondly, we study, for the diﬀerent envisaged sequence types,
the impact of the preamble length on the detection accuracy. This study gives an important
insight on how the training sub-sequence should be chosen in order to achieve a better trade-
oﬀbetween detection accuracy and complexity. In fact, with the same overhead, a more or
less accurate detection can be achieved depending on the preamble sub-sequence type. Then,
an experimental study of the impact of the uncertainty interval width on the detection per-
formance is realized. We show that, above a certain critical width, widening the uncertainty
interval results in only more computational load without enhancing the detection performance.
The second issue concerns the choice of the correlation sequence for training sub-sequence
deﬁned in the frequency domain. In particular, we study the optimization of the correlation
sequence, which is used during the ﬁne stage to carry diﬀerential correlation operations. The
optimization aims to ﬁnd the best sub-optimal correlation sequence in terms of providing
near optimal performance (provided by the optimal correlation sequence generated from the
90

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
preamble). The sub-optimal sequence is chosen among a subset of sequences obtained through
the quantiﬁcation of the original sequence, and whose elements take their values from a ﬁnite
QPSK alphabet (±1 ± j). The interest of such class is that it allows replacing the diﬀerential
correlation operations, characterized by its high complexity, by simple sign changes. Hence,
the complexity involved for the ﬁne metric calculation is considerably reduced by applying
sign change operations instead of complex multiplications. The sub-optimal sequence search is
carried oﬀ-line, thus relaxing the complexity of the sequence design procedure. Three search
algorithms are here developed and evaluated.
We ﬁrst propose two classical optimization
schemes and compare their eﬃciency. Then, we formulate the sequence optimization problem
using the genetic algorithm approach. The simulation results show that the use of sub-optimal
sequences gives near-best detection performance (which are provided by the optimal correlation
sequence) with considerably lower complexity, recording an advantage realized by the genetic
algorithm based search over the two other proposed algorithms.
5.1
Training and Correlation Sequences
We recall that similarly to the work in [15], the herein used preamble consists of a single
symbol built of two identical training sub-sequences. Both Time Domain (TD) training and
Frequency Domain (FD) training are here investigated. The preamble structure is depicted in
ﬁgure 5.1. We note that, as for OFDM data symbols, the CP-extended preamble has a length
of Ns samples. Depending on the training sub-sequence type, the length of the preamble useful
part may be equal to that of the OFDM symbol, and thus denoted by Nu = 2Lu, or diﬀerent
from the OFDM symbol length and denoted by Num = 2Lum.
Figure 5.1: Preamble Structure.
In the TD case, the preamble is made repetitive through the concatenation of the two
identical training sub-sequences of length Lum = 2m −1 each, and is then sent directly in the
91

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
time domain. The choice of such implementation is adopted to preserve the properties of the
binary PN training sub-sequences, like m-sequences and Gold sequences, whose properties may
be destroyed by the IFFT application. When using randomly generated sequences, the two
halves of the preamble are made identical by transmitting data on the even frequencies, while
zeros are used on the odd frequencies, followed by the IFFT application as done in [15]. In
this case, the FD training sub-sequence length is Lu = 2m and the IFFT size is Nu = 2m+1.
In our work, the training sub-sequence is used to generate the Correlation Sequence (CS)
α as in equation (4.1) which can also be deﬁned in TD or FD. Let us recall the expression of
the CS generated from the TD training sub-sequence as
αTD(d) = p∗
dpd+Lum+q = p∗
dpd+q,
d ∈[0, Lum −1],
(5.1)
and from the FD training sub-sequence as
αFD(d) = p∗
dpd+Lu+q = p∗
dpd+q,
d ∈[0, Lu −1].
(5.2)
In the former sequence type, as the whole preamble length Ns is kept equal to that of the
OFDM symbols, the preamble CP length Ngm is appended with Ns −Num samples.
The repetitive structure of the preamble used in our approach allows a coarse time synchro-
nization respecting [15] regardless the sequence type. For ﬁne synchronization, the type of the
training sub-sequence used to generate both the preamble and the correlation sequence has an
impact on the system performance (as will be shown later). Thus, it is important to build
the preamble in such a way to optimize the synchronization performance. It is worth to note
that, although the simulations in this chapter are conducted for the RC approach, the study
remains available for the BF approach which uses the same ﬁne metric calculated along larger
interval.
5.2
Optimization of the Training Sequence
The training sub-sequence can be chosen randomly or respecting speciﬁc criterion. During the
ﬁrst coarse stage, the repetitive structure is the sole required condition for successful coarse
synchronization, regardless of the training sequence type. However, the ﬁne stage requires
92

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
judicious choice of the training sub-sequence such to have an important correlation property.
Furthermore, as it is calculated over relatively short uncertainty interval, the ﬁne stage may
provide diﬀerent performance depending on the uncertainty interval width.
In this section, we present simulation results to evaluate the performance of the RC time
synchronization approach, using diﬀerent preamble training sub-sequence types and lengths,
under multipath propagation condition. We ﬁrst evaluate the impact of the preamble sub-
sequence type on the metric and thus on the detection accuracy. Then, we assess the impact
of both the preamble length and the uncertainty interval length on the detection performance.
The measure used to evaluate the performance is the achieved CDR of the preamble start,
where the estimated ˆτf exactly coincides with the true one τ (no error tolerance). For each
SNR value, 104 Monte Carlo realizations are averaged, where both noise and sequence are
randomly chosen. It is important to mention that preferred pairs of m-sequences, used in Gold
sequence generation, do not exist for m = 4, 8, 12 and 16. Furthermore, Kasami sequences are
deﬁned only for even values of m, which restricts a fair comparison to a few preamble lengths
possible values.
5.2.1
Impact of the Training Sequence Type
We note that the required properties of the preamble training sequences are related to their
autocorrelation. Indeed, the sequences should be meticulously chosen in such a way to have
good correlation properties in terms of minimizing the maximum value of the out-of-phase
autocorrelation. The smaller is the out-of-phase autocorrelation of the chosen sequence type,
the lower is the number of sub-peaks and the more accurate is the time estimation. In this
section, we study the eﬀect of the preamble training sub-sequence type within the set of binary
sequences including m-sequences, Gold, Kasami and random sequences. The ﬁne timing metric
in equation (4.3) related to these sequence types are presented in ﬁgure 5.2 for arbitrary
chosen sequence in each of the above mentioned 4 sequence types. More precisely, a random
binary sequence of ±1, two arbitrarily chosen m-sequences (m-sequence 1, m-sequence 2), each
generated using a diﬀerent primitive polynomial. A Gold sequence and a Kasami sequence
obtained from m-sequence 2 are also envisaged. The parameter m is set to 6, leading to a
preamble of 126 useful samples extended with a CP of length 12 samples. We consider a channel
of Np = 4 paths with an exponential power delay proﬁle. Paths are regularly separated by 2
samples and the ratio of the ﬁrst path to the last path is set to 6 dB. The primitive polynomials
93

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
used to generate m-sequence 1 and m-sequence 2 are respectively P1 = 1 + x + x2 + x5 + x6
and P2 = 1 + x + x6. Random data are sent before the preamble transmission.
As shown in ﬁgure 5.2, some side-peaks appear at positions that do not correspond to any
path for the choice of m-sequence type. As predicted, this problem is avoided by using one
among the Gold or Kasami sequences generated from the considered m-sequence 2. Indeed,
the weakness of the m-sequences is that the generated correlation sequence α (5.1) used for
the diﬀerential correlation coincides with a shifted version of the original training sub-sequence
p1 = [p0, p1, . . . , pLum−1], thus resulting in the appearance of ghost paths in the metric shape
for the case of multipath channels. It is worth to note that, for a given multipath channel,
certain m-sequences are more adapted than others by avoiding side-peaks eﬀect as depicted in
the ﬁgure 5.2.a. This dependency is avoided by the Gold and Kasami sequences, which clearly
capture the channel proﬁle. The training sub-sequence type has, in this manner, a great impact
on the ﬁne timing metric shape thus aﬀecting the detection performance.

(b) M-sequence, Gold and Kasami sequences

channel (4 paths, SNR=10 dB)
To assess the impact of the training sequence choice, we evaluate the detection accuracy
through the preamble start CDR and its estimation variance criteria. Considering two evalu-
ation scenarios for OFDM systems having diﬀerent parameters. In the ﬁrst scenario, we use
the same system parameters as in the previous evaluation of section 4.2.3.1 in which m = 9
and under the multipath channel with 7 paths. We consider random sequences of ±1, two
m-sequences generated using the primitive polynomials P1 = 1 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x7 + x8 + x9
and P2 = 1+x+x3 +x4 +x5 +x6 +x7 +x8 +x9, for which the diﬀerence in the performance is
94

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
prominent. To overcome this gap, a random choice of an m-sequence realized for each iteration
is also considered. Finally, a Gold sequence deduced from the randomly chosen m-sequence
is used. The methodology adopted to generate the Gold sequences consists in ﬁrst ﬁnding a
preferred pair of primitive polynomials of order m = 9. Second, the sequences corresponding to
the polynomials are implemented by using a shift register architecture. Then, the Lum diﬀerent
phases of one of the generated sequences is used to ﬁnd each of the Lum + 2 possible Gold
sequences. One among these sequences is randomly picked out to be used in the simulation.
We note that in this scenario, the Kasami sequences are not taken into consideration because
they are not deﬁned for even values of m.
Figure 5.3.(a) illustrates the CDR of the RC estimator with diﬀerent sequence types used
to generate the preamble.
Despite the use of the same sequence type (m-sequences), the
detection performance is greatly enhanced through an adequately chosen m-sequence. For a
target CDR of 80% a gain of about 2 dB is achieved using m-sequence 1 with respect to m-
sequence 2. As can be observed, the random choice of one m-sequence among the 48 deﬁned
m-sequences provides a detection rate between the two separately simulated m-sequences and
almost equal to the detection rate provided by a random sequence of ±1. The best detection
rate is provided by the use of Gold sequences, especially at very low SNR, which achieves a gain
of about 2 dB compared to the other considered sequence types. This enhancement is due to
the disappearance of ghost sub-peaks inherent to the m-sequences and problematic especially
in the multipath channels.

95

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
Figure 5.3.(b) shows the variance of the time estimate using the sequences cited above.
In concordance with the previous results, the Gold sequences provide the lowest estimation
variance, which vanishes at an SNR of 1 dB. The other sequences have almost the same
estimation variances with a slight gain realized by m-sequence 1. All the curves vanish at an
SNR of about 4 dB, which improves the robustness of the proposed RC approach. The CDR
curves show that for SNR higher than 0 dB, all sequence types lead to almost perfect detection.
On the contrary, the variance curves show the impact of the sequence choice on the detection
accuracy and thus gives a complementary information concerning the detection error (in terms
of samples).
The second scenario considers Kasami sequences in addition to the previously evaluated
sequence types. To make possible the comparison of all considered sequence types, we set the
preamble length to Num = 2(26 −1) = 126 to which a CP of length Ngm = 12 samples is
prepended. This choice is justiﬁed by the limited values of m for which both Gold and Kasami
sequences are deﬁned.
The channel used in the present simulation is the same multipath
channel used to draw the metrics in the start of this section (4 paths with exponential power
delay proﬁle). The curves evaluating the CDR and the preamble start estimation variance
are drawn in ﬁgure 5.4, in which the choice of the training sub-sequence type impact on the
detection performance is clearly shown.
As could be observed in ﬁgure 5.4.a, the random sequence of ±1 provides the worst detection
rate while a random choice of an m-sequence among the set of possible sequences gives slightly
better detection accuracy.
For an SNR value lower than 2 dB, Gold sequences somewhat
outperform Kasami sequences. For higher values of SNR, Kasami sequences realize a gain of
about 2 dB with respect to Gold sequences for a CDR target of 90%. These two sequence
types provide a perfect detection (CDR=100%) for SNR value above 18 dB, which is not the
case using m-sequences and random sequences that exhibit a ﬂoor eﬀect at a rate of about
97%. Figure 5.4.b shows the variance of the time estimate using the sequences cited above.
For an SNR lower than 0 dB, all sequences provide almost the same estimation variance. For
higher SNR values, in concordance with the CDR, the Kasami sequences provide the lowest
estimation variance, realizing a gain of about 5 dB for 0.3 squared samples, compared to Gold
sequences. For this SNR range, all sequence types show ﬂoor eﬀect in the variance estimation
curves corresponding to an estimation error of about 0.13 for Kasami sequences, 0.3 for Gold
sequences, 3 for m-sequences and 3.75 for random sequences.

The study conducted here proves the sensitivity of the detection accuracy provided by the
RC approach to the training sub-sequence type and choice.
It is shown that, at very low
SNR, Gold sequences slightly outperform the other sequence types. For moderate SNR values,
Kasami sequences provide better detection, while at higher SNR values all sequences oﬀer
almost perfect detection. We also note that among the considered types, m-sequences are the
most sensitive to the multipath eﬀect that cause potential ghost side-peaks appearing in the
ﬁne metric shape.
5.2.2
Impact of the Training Sequence Length
The training sub-sequence length, and hence the preamble length, is one of the most critical
parameters to ﬁx synchronization performance. Short preambles are sometimes preferred be-
cause they take less time to be processed than long preambles and they minimize the overhead,
yet they are not suitable for multipath propagation because the ISI free signal interval used
to compute the metric will be reduced. To assess the impact of the preamble length on the
detection accuracy, for the diﬀerent training sub-sequence types, we evaluate the CDR using
diﬀerent preamble lengths. For m-sequences and random sequences, m is set to 5, 6, 7, 8 and
9. As Kasami sequences are deﬁned for only even values of m, we consider the values of 6 and
8. For Gold sequences, which are not deﬁned for m values multiple of 4, we envisage m = 5,
6, 7 and 9.
97

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
Figure 5.5 shows, for each sequence type, the detection rates using the diﬀerent possible
preamble lengths. It is obvious that independently of the sequence type, the detection accuracy
is enhanced with a longer preamble. Under the same propagation conditions and using the same
preamble length, the detection accuracy is found to strongly depend on the preamble training
sequence type. For preamble lengths lower than 254 samples, the rate provided by m-sequences
and random sequences stagnates at 90%. However, using Gold and Kasami sequences, the
detection rate reaches 100% for high SNR values (> 10 dB). Using longer preambles, all
sequence types provide almost perfect detection at high SNR value.

To assess the trade-oﬀbetween the preamble length and the detection accuracy we provide
in table 5.1 the minimum required preamble length (in samples) for diﬀerent targets of correct
detection rate for an SNR value of 0 dB. To provide a target correct detection rate more than

60% at an SNR of 0 dB, table 5.1 shows that we require a preamble length ≥254 samples
using m-sequences and random sequences, whereas using Gold and Kasami sequences we need a
preamble of length ≥126 samples. Hence, we note that for the same CDR target, it is possible
through a judicious choice of training sequence type to reduce the computational complexity
to its half. This reduction is possible by using the sequence type for which the CDR is reached
with the shortest preamble. We note that even if the Kasami sequences outperform the other
considered sequence types, for example for a CDR target of 70%, the lower complexity is
obtained using one of the other types because Kasami sequences are not deﬁned for m = 7.

Impact of the Uncertainty Interval Width
In this section, we evaluate the impact of the uncertainty interval width (∆τ), over which
the ﬁne stage is carried, on the detection performance. In particular, we study the trade-oﬀ
between detection accuracy and computational load. To this end, we assess the CDR of the
preamble start estimate for diﬀerent values of ∆τ. The same previously considered sequence
types are here simulated using a preamble length of Num = 126 samples. Simulation results
are depicted in ﬁgure 5.6 where 5 curves are presented, for each sequence type, corresponding
to ∆τ = Ngm, (4/3)Ngm, 2Ngm, 4Ngm and 8Ngm. At very low SNR (< −6 dB), the detection
performance is almost the same, independently of the sequence type and of the uncertainty
interval ∆τ.
Generally, as ∆τ value increases, the provided detection rates are enhanced
for all the training sub-sequence types. The ﬁgure 5.6 shows that above a certain ∆τ value
(∆τ = 8Ngm in this case), the detection accuracy degrades at low SNR, especially for Gold
and Kasami sequences. This unpredictable eﬀect comes from the fact that the longer is the
search interval, the higher is the probability that a false peak appears, especially at low SNR.
For moderate values (< 4 dB) of SNR, the use the same length of ∆τ = 8Ngm provides lower
performance than ∆τ = 4Ngm, for all the envisaged sequence types. Above 4 dB, choosing
99

∆τ = 8Ngm provides the same performance as ∆τ = 4Ngm.

In table 5.2, we present the impact of the uncertainty interval width ∆τ on the compu-
tational load and the detection accuracy. For an SNR value of 0 dB and a preamble length
Num = 126, we evaluate the NCM (Number of Complex Multiplications carried to detect the
ﬁrst preamble) as deﬁned in section 4.2.3.2. For each length of the uncertainty interval ∆τ, we
also present the CDR of the preamble start for each training sub-sequence type. It is worth
to note that by increasing ∆τ, the detection performance can be ameliorated up to a speciﬁc
length (4Ngm in this case). Indeed, as shown in the table, the value of ∆τ = 8Ngm provides a
detection rate slightly worse than that provided by ∆τ = 4Ngm, yet with higher computational
load.
To summarize, we notice that to optimize the trade-oﬀbetween synchronization performance

and computational load, a judicious choice of the training sub-sequence type and length as well
as of the uncertainty interval width should be accomplished. Indeed, with the same complexity,
the detection accuracy can be ameliorated using an appropriate choice of the sequence type.
Furthermore, simulation results show that it is possible to enhance the detection accuracy with
shorter overhead using well suited training sub-sequence type. Moreover, evaluating the impact
of the uncertainty interval length, we notice that it becomes useless to widen the uncertainty
interval length up to certain value and this will result in more complexity without enhancing
the detection accuracy and for low SNR it even degrades the detection performance.

Optimization of the Correlation Sequence
The performance analysis realized in the previous section and in section 4.2.3.1 proved the
eﬃciency of the proposed RC approach thanks to the use of diﬀerential correlation between
αFD, which is generated from the preamble training sub-sequence as in (5.2), and the dif-
ferentially modulated version of the received signal Y as in (4.2). Although the diﬀerential
correlation operations have high complexity, by splitting the synchronization processing into
two stages, wherein the ﬁrst stage sliding correlation, characterized by its low complexity is
carried while diﬀerential correlation is used during the ﬁne stage over a reduced interval, an
overall reduced-complexity synchronization is guaranteed.
To further reduce the computational load at the receiver, the idea here is to simplify the
diﬀerential correlation operations. More precisely, we suggest to replace the diﬀerential corre-
lation operations, carried during the ﬁne stage, by simple sign changes. To this aim, we need
to derive the best sub-optimal CS in terms of providing near optimal CS performance from a
ﬁnite QPSK alphabet (±1±j). The sub-optimal CS design is carried oﬀ-line through diﬀerent
101

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
algorithms. We present three search method for deriving the QPSK sequence, namely the
Deterministic Design Algorithm (DDA) [37], the Iterative Design Algorithm (IDA) [37] and
the Genetic Algorithm based search [40].
5.3.1
Classic Design Algorithms
The idea of these algorithms is to search for the QPSK sequence leading to the nearest syn-
chronization performance compared to the optimal CS α by searching the sign changes that
provide the highest correlation with α.
5.3.1.1
Deterministic Design Algorithm
A deterministic process is here adopted to search the sub-optimal CS. Its aim is to ﬁrst look
for the argument θ that maximizes the metric FDDA deﬁned as
FDDA(θ) =
Lu−1
X
k=0
|R(α(k)e−jθ)| + |I(α(k)e−jθ)|, θ ∈[0, π/2].
(5.3)
The metric FDDA is periodic with period π/2. Figure 5.7 presents the metric FDDA(θ) drawn
for diﬀerent gauge of ∆θ (π/1000 and π/50) using two diﬀerent randomly generated preamble
training sub-sequences S1 and S2. We note that each scenario provides diﬀerent maximum
values and arguments which may result in diﬀerent detection performance. Looking at the
peaks of each curve, we observe that the maximum value of FDDA(θ) depends on ∆θ and that
the maximum argument θmax can be missed for large values of ∆θ.
Secondly, the elements of the sub-optimal CS are then obtained from the sign of the real and
imaginary parts of the optimal sequence α when compensated with the phase θmax as

5.3.1.2
Iterative Design Algorithm
The iterative algorithm ﬁrst deﬁnes the metric FIDA operating on a randomly chosen sequence
S = [s(0), s(1), . . . , s(Lu −1)], from a ﬁnite QPSK constellation, written as
FIDA(S) =

α(k)s∗(k) = ρ(S)ejθ(S),
(5.5)
From the initial random sequence S, the algorithm iteratively recalculates the metric FIDA
in order to maximize its amplitude ρ. For each iteration i, the metric is compensated by the
phase θ(i−1) of its previous value. At the ith iteration, the IDA can be summarized as follows
1. For the updated sequence S(i) (for i = 0, S(0) is the initial randomly QPSK generated
sequence), calculate the metric in equation (5.5),
2. Compensate α(i) with the phase θ(i) resulting from the metric FIDA calculated in step 1,
which provides a new sequence α(i+1),

θ(i+1) −θ(i) is below a given threshold, or as the achievement of a parameterized maximum
number of iterations. Then, the best sub-optimal correlation sequence β is considered as the
last generated sequence S(imax). We note that, for various initial sequences S, the detection
performance may be diﬀerent. This can be proved by trying many random sequences.
5.3.1.3
Comparison of the DDA and IDA Performance
To assess the performance degradation caused by the quantiﬁcation of the CS, we use the
criterion of the preamble start CDR (as previously deﬁned) and its estimation variance. A
quantitative evaluation of the complexity gain is achieved to measure the NCM saved thanks
to the use of the QPSK sub-optimal sequences. The RC synchronization approach is here
evaluated in 4 scenarios using diﬀerent correlation sequences: the optimal sequence α, a sub-
optimal quantiﬁed version of α, generated from the sign of α elements as α′ = sign (R (α)) +
jsign (I (α)), and the two quantiﬁed sequences obtained by the oﬀ-line application of the DDA
and IDA, denoted respectively by βDDA and βIDA. In the IDA, the stop condition is ﬁxed by
a maximum number of iteration set to 103. The OFDM system and the channel parameters
are the same described in section 4.2.3.1 (m = 9, multipath channel with 7 paths).
Figure 5.8 depicts the CDR of the preamble start (a) and its estimation variance (b) in
the AWGN channel. The optimal sequence α provides the best performance detection, yet
with higher complexity compared to the other sub-optimal CS. The sequence α′ provides the
worst performance. In between, the new sequences βDDA and βIDA give the same detection
performance. For a target CDR of 80%, the sequence α realizes a slight gain of about 0.8
dB, compared to the quantiﬁed sequences βDDA and βIDA. Consistently with the CDR, the
variance provided using the optimal CS α is the lowest one and its curve vanishes at an SNR
equal to -3 dB, thus realizing a gain of about 1 dB compared to the quantiﬁed sub-optimal
correlation sequences, whose curves vanish at -2 dB.
The previously presented results are shown in ﬁgure 5.9 in the case of multipath channel.
The same eﬀects are here observed. Indeed, the optimal sequence α outperforms the other
quantiﬁed sub-optimal sequences. For all considered sequences, the detection becomes perfect
(CDR = 100%) above an SNR of about -3 dB and 0 dB respectively in the monopath AWGN
and multipath channels.
To compare the computational load involved in the ﬁne stage using the optimal sequence

α and the sub-optimal sequences, generated by the mean of the proposed DDA and IDA, we
assess the NCM operations carried during the ﬁne stage. We recall that a diﬀerential correlation
operation (carried using α) costs Lu complex multiplications.
Thus, when correlating the
received signal with α, the ﬁne metric complexity is of ∆τLu complex multiplication operations.
Whereas, only one sign change operation is required using the quantiﬁed sequences βDDA, βIDA
and α′. Hence, the complexity of the ﬁne metric calculation can be reduced to ∆τ sign change
operations, respecting the sign of sub-optimal CS sequences, which is a triﬂing complexity
treatment compared to complex multiplication operations.
To evaluate the performance degradation caused by the CS quantiﬁcation, we also present
the SNR required to reach a target correct detection rate of 70%.
We note that the ﬁne
metric calculated using all the quantiﬁed correlation sequences have the same complexity, as
they replace the diﬀerential correlation operations by sign changes. As shown in table 5.3, the
complexity involved using the optimal sequence α is about 52 103, which is much more high
than that of the sub-optimal sequence that costs only 102 sign change operations. However, its
gain in terms of detection accuracy is slight in both AWGN and multipath channels compared
to sub-optimal CS case. Indeed, for a target correct detection rate of 70%, a loss of only 0.8
dB is occasioned by the use of βDDA and βIDA.
From the simulation carried in this section, we note that the use of sub-optimal quantiﬁed
CS helps to reduce the computational load at the expense of a slight performance degradation.
However, even for exhaustive search, over the huge set of CS candidates within sequences

taken from QPSK alphabets, the quantiﬁed resulting CS may correspond to local sub-optimal
sequence, which does not provide the near-best detection performance.
As an alternative,
we suggest the use a Genetic Algorithms (GA) based search approach to further lessen the
performance degradation occasioned by the use of sub-optimal sequences.
5.3.2
Genetic Algorithms Based Design
In the IDA and DDA search techniques, an important complexity reduction was recorded at
the expense of a loss in detection accuracy. To minimize this loss, with respect to the optimal
CS, we here opt for a genetic algorithms based search to ﬁnd the sub-optimal quantiﬁed CS
that leads to near-best CS performance [36]. Indeed, the GA principle provides a powerful tool
to eﬃciently explore a very large space of solutions, which is the case in the present work in
which the set of CS candidates is huge. Furthermore, the GA-based search methods have the
106

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
advantage of avoiding the sensitivity to initialization, as it is required in the case of the IDA.
The GA [111] search techniques are generally used to ﬁnd true or approximate solutions to
optimization and search problems. They are exploited in diﬀerent application ﬁelds of com-
munication engineering such as sequence generation, cooperative communication and PAPR
reduction [112]- [114]. Generally, the optimization using GA allows numerical solution other-
wise unfeasible or complicated to be carried by using an by analytical approach. In our case,
we exploit the GA search scheme to generate the sub-optimal CS. We note that this processing
is done oﬀ-line, which relaxes the complexity of the exhaustive search procedure and avoids
real-time constraints.
5.3.2.1
Overview of Genetic Algorithms
The genetic algorithms are evolutionary search techniques used to ﬁnd true or approximate
solutions for optimization and search problems [110]. A GA is a random search technique that
seeks out the best feature from an evolving available search space known as population. This
latter comprises a group of individuals, each characterized by a set of chromosomes, considered
as candidates which can be selected as solutions. The individuals of the ﬁrst population are
generated randomly. The search procedure is performed based on an objective function known
as ﬁtness function. In each iteration, the candidates of a population are evaluated according to
their ﬁtness values. Several processes such as crossing and mutation allow introducing diversity
through the successive populations. In crossing, a particular group of well ranked individuals,
which are chosen as parents, are used to generate the oﬀspring according to a crossing rule.
The ﬁtness of the oﬀspring will also be evaluated in a similar way to their parents. To avoid
local optimal problems, randomly generated individuals can be inserted in a new generation.
This cycle is repeated until a desired termination criterion is reached (convergence, a predeﬁned
number of generations is produced). The best individual in the last population is considered
as a solution of the problem.
5.3.2.2
Proposed Genetic Algorithms-Based CS Search
The process of the proposed GA-based search scheme starts with the deﬁnition of the coding
rule and consequently the population initialization. Then, the sequential reproduction of new
populations is carried, based on the chromosomes of individuals (candidates) having the best
107

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
goodness (ﬁtness function), until a stop condition is met.
Diﬀerent steps involved in this
processing are hereafter described.
a) GA Parameters Deﬁnition for the CS Optimization
Coding: Finding a suitable coding of the chromosomes is one of the most tricky and diﬃcult
problems in applying GAs. A good choice of representation will make the search easy by lim-
iting the search space, a poor choice will result in a large search space. Various coding types
exist (Bit string, real number representation, order-based representation, embedded lists...).
We here choose the value encoding method, in which each individual represents a CS deﬁned
as an array of Lu chromosomes represented by complex number from QPSK alphabet (±1±j).
Population initialization: The initial population is composed of P individuals randomly
generated from a QPSK constellation (±1 ± j). Thus, the population is a (P,Lu) matrix of
complex elements taken from QPSK alphabet. We note that P must be parameterized depend-
ing on the CS length Lu (the longer is Lu, the higher is P) in order to explore a suﬃciently
large number of the CS candidates space of size L4
u.
b) GA Processes Deﬁnition for CS Optimization
Selection: The selection of the best individuals is here chosen to be based on the evaluation of
the ﬁtness function |FIDA(S)|, expressed in equation (5.5), which we aim to maximize. Within
one generation, the individuals selected as survivors to be preserved in the updated population,
are those giving the best ﬁtness function values. There are diﬀerent possible selection proce-
dures in the GAs depending on how the ﬁtness value is used. Proportional (roulette-wheel),
truncation and tournament selections are the most popular selection procedures. We here opt
for the truncation selection, where the solution candidates are ordered by ﬁtness value, and a
proportion p (e.g. p = 1/2, 1/3, etc) of the ﬁttest individuals is selected as survivors. In this
case, the individual of high ﬁtness has an important probability to survive and to create an
oﬀspring and thus to transfer its genes to the next population.
Crossover: The ﬁrst step in the reproduction process is the crossover, in which the chro-
mosomes of the parents Pn and Pm are used to form an entirely new individual.
It is a
108

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
recombination operator that combines sub-parts of the two parents chromosomes to produce
two oﬀspring O1 and O2 that inherit some parts of both parents genetic material.
One-point crossover combines two chromosomes with one crossover point. Multi-point crossover
combines two individual with several crossover points. Uniform crossover makes a mask formed
by a binary sequence and generates two children chromosomes from those of their parents, us-
ing this mask. In our work, we choose the multi-point crossover for more diversity. In each
iteration, a number of crossover operations c is randomly chosen lower than a maximum ﬁxed
crossover point number. The crossover positions are also randomly chosen.
Mutation: The mutation operation prevents the convergence to a locally optimum solu-
tion. It is an operation involving changing some chromosomes to introduce variations into
the individual. The newly created population (by means of selection and crossover) is later
subject to mutation. This operation occurs with small probability Pmu and replaces the chosen
chromosomes by randomly generated ones.
Note that the crossover and mutation operators are means of large exploration of the so-
lutions space. The higher is the number of crossover points c, the quicker is the introduction
of new solutions into the population. However, as c increases the solutions may be disrupted
faster. Similarly, the mutation probability Pmu also aﬀects the quality of the population. Large
values of Pmu transform the GA into a purely random search algorithm, while some mutation
are required to prevent the premature convergence of the GA to sub-optimal solutions.
After performing the crossover and mutation operations in the current generation, individ-
uals with high ﬁtness are selected to be used in the reproduction of the new population. In
our work, to avoid the problem of having a local optimal solution, 10% of each new population
is generated randomly. From the new population, based on the ﬁttest ﬁtness values of the
individuals, the reproduction procedure is repeated until either the stagnation of the ﬁtness
maximum value or a speciﬁed maximum number of iterations is reached. The sequence having
the highest ﬁtness in the last population is elected as the optimal CS.
5.3.3
Comparison of Classic and GA-Based Search Schemes
In this section, the comparison of the detection accuracy provided by the use of the GA-based
quantiﬁed CS to the classically generated CS through the DDA and IDA schemes, which provide
109

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
almost the same detection accuracy is conducted.
To assess the performance degradation
occasioned by the used of the diﬀerently quantiﬁed correlation sequences, the comparison also
involves the optimal sequence α.
Three scenarios are here simulated for three diﬀerent CS lengths Lu. The population size,
crossover rate and mutation rate are then chosen depending on Lu ∈{64, 128, 256}.
An
exhaustive search over all possible QPSK CS involves 16.7 106, 26.8 107 and 42.9 108 candidates
respectively for sequence lengths of 64, 128 and 256. This results in a prohibitive complexity
thus justifying the GA-based search eﬃciency. Note that the longer is the CS, the higher are
the population size, the crossover and mutation rates. The population size is set to 103 for the
considered CS lengths of 64 and 128 samples and to 104 for the length of 256 samples. In each
iteration, the number of crossover points is chosen randomly lower than 10% of Lu and their
positions are also picked out randomly. Mutation rate is set to 0.2% of the sequence length Lu.
The stop condition for the generation of populations is the stagnation of the maximum ﬁtness
value which is deﬁned through simulation. To ﬁx the number of iterations required to reach the
stop condition, we evaluate the maximum ﬁtness values for all considered CS lengths. Figure
5.10 shows the evolution of maximum, mean and minimum ﬁtness values for 103 iterations
(generations) for the considered Lu values. As shown in the ﬁgure, the maximum ﬁtness value
stagnates after a certain number of generations. Hence, we need to set the maximum number
of generations to a best ﬁt number that helps us to ﬁnd the optimal solution without wasting
execution time.
Through experimental search, we set the stop condition of the GA-based
iterative processing to 200 generations, 500 generations and 1000 generations respectively for
CS lengths equal to 64, 128 and 256 samples.
The CP length Ng is set to 5% of the CS length, the correlation shift q is set to 1 and
the uncertainty interval ∆τ is taken equal to the CP length (Ng). We consider an AWGN
monopath channel and an exponential power delay proﬁle 4-path channel of memory LH = 12
samples. The ratio of the ﬁrst path to the last path is of 12 dB with uniform adjacent path
ratio of 3 dB. The 4 eﬀective paths are uniformly spaced with a delay of 3 samples. For all
considered scenarios, we use the Monte Carlo simulation method with 104 iterations.
Figure 5.11 presents the CDR of the preamble start (a) and its estimation variance (b) in
the AWGN channel. We note that the use of the optimal sequence α in equation (5.1) provides
the best detection performance. The CS generated through GA-based scheme, within QPSK
alphabet, provides slightly lower detection rate with a loss of about 0.2 dB. The sub-optimal

quantiﬁed CS provided by the IDA (and the DDA) has the worst performance detection.
Considering a CS of length 64, for a target CDR of 80%, the optimal sequence α realizes a
gain of about 0.2 dB and 2 dB, compared to respectively the GA-based and the IDA-based
correlation sequence choices. Both of the sub-optimal CS provide a correct detection (with a
rate of 100%) above an SNR of 0 dB.
Figure 5.11.(b) shows that, consistently with the CDR, the variances provided using α and
the GA-based searched CS vanish at an SNR equal to −1 dB with a gain of about 1 dB realized
by the optimal sequence α for Lu = 256 samples. Whereas, the variance corresponding to the
CS chosen using the IDA vanishes at an SNR equal to 2 dB. For shorter preamble length
Lu = 64, the variance values vanish at SNR equal to 4 dB using the optimal sequence and 5
dB using the sub-optimal sequences, yet the GA-based generated sequence provides almost the
same detection as the optimal one. Generally, the longer is the CS, the lower is the variance.
This behavior is inverted for low SNR values (< −3 dB) where the noise dominates the received
signal. This fact is due to the uncertainty interval length which limits the maximum variance
value, whose length is here chosen as a fraction of the preamble length.
Figure 5.12 shows the frame start CDR (a) and the time estimation variance (b) of the con-
sidered scenarios in the case of multipath channel. As in the previous monopath channel case,

the optimal CS α provides the most accurate detection, yet it leads to a high computational
load at the receiver. The IDA-based quantiﬁed CS provides the worst performance detection.
In between, the GA-based CS provides almost the same accuracy as that obtained by the op-
timal sequence α. The loss resulting from the quantiﬁcation of the CS slightly rises compared
to the case of the monopath AWGN channel.
It is also worth to note that as we use the
same population size for both sequence lengths Lu ∈{64, 128}, the performance degradation
occasioned by the use of the sub-optimal sequence is higher for the longer sequence.
Note that the compared sub-optimal CS design methods (GA-based and IDA-based) pro-
vide QPSK (±1 ± j) sequences allowing simple sign changes instead of diﬀerential correlation
operations. Thus, they have the same reception complexity, which is greatly lower than the
complexity resulting from the use of the optimal correlation sequence α. For the execution time
of the CS search, the GA-based search takes much more time than the IDA-based search. This
is expected since the GA is more computationally complex due to the crossover operations and
the number of generations that ﬁx the execution time. However, as the CS choice optimization
is carried oﬀ-line, the GA-based search higher complexity is not critical and it can be considered
as the most appropriate one. It is demonstrated that compared to the iteratively generated
CS, the GA-based generated sequence improves the detection accuracy and compared to the
optimal CS α, it provides slightly lower detection accuracy with important reduction in the
receiver complexity. The advantage of GA over IDA is to avoid local sub-optimal solutions by

Conclusions
In the previous chapter, we have assessed the performance of the RC technique which was
shown to provide high detection accuracy with low computational load. To further reduce the
computational load of the proposed RC technique, we have studied the optimization of several
critical parameters in this chapter. First, for binary time domain generated sequences, the
eﬀect of the preamble training sequence choice (type and length) on the detection accuracy
was studied. Simulation results, carried in the case of multipath channel and using diﬀerent
sequence types (m-sequence, random, Gold and Kasami sequences), proved that with the same
overhead (same complexity) the detection accuracy can be ameliorated using an appropriate
sequence type choice. Consequently, it is possible to reduce the computational load by choosing
suitable type and shorter training sub-sequence. The optimization of the uncertainty interval
width, over which the ﬁne stage is carried, was also studied through simulations. It was shown
that, increasing the uncertainty interval width, the detection accuracy can be enhanced up
to a certain width above which the detection performance stagnates and may degrades for
some training sub-sequence types. Hence, to optimize the trade-oﬀbetween synchronization
performance and computational load, a judicious choice of the training sub-sequence type and
113

Chapter 5. Simply Diﬀerential Synchronization: Optimized Performance
length as well as of the uncertainty interval width should be accomplished.
In the second part of this chapter, we have proposed search algorithms to optimize the
correlation sequence choice for frequency domain generated training sub-sequences. The idea
behind the CS optimization was to generate a sub-optimal sequence belonging to a ﬁnite QPSK
alphabet (±1 ± j), which allows to replace the diﬀerential correlations carried during the ﬁne
stage by simple sign changes. We investigated the sequence search through two classic iterative
and deterministic schemes and a genetic algorithm based scheme. The advantage of the GA
based search over classic search (deterministic and iterative) schemes is its adequacy to avoid
local optimal and its lower sensitivity to the initialization of CS candidates. Simulation results
conducted in both monopath AWGN and multipath channels showed the eﬀectiveness of the
use of sub-optimal sequence in further lowering the reception computation cost of the RC
synchronization technique. Indeed, when compared to the performance obtained using the
optimal CS, the GA-based search oﬀers a CS that provides very close detection accuracy, while
the sequence generated through classic search algorithms provides 2 dB lower performance.
Furthermore, the use of the sub-optimal sequences results in a complexity reduction of Lu
complex multiplications per correlation step calculated during the ﬁne synchronization stage.

Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential
Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu
Sequences
The so far proposed synchronization algorithms use training sequences made of binary elements
either in time or frequency domains and do not exploit further characteristics than their good
autocorrelation properties. In the present chapter, we consider Zadoﬀ-Chu (ZC) sequences,
which have been proposed as training sequences in modern wireless communication systems,
and tailor synchronization approaches constructed based on ZC sequences structure, replacing
the conventional random and pseudo-random sequences thanks to their perfect autocorrelation
properties.
ZC sequences are indeed a class of CAZAC sequences, which we have brieﬂy
introduced in section 3.2.2, deﬁned for prime lengths. Exploiting ZC sequences in the time
domain, we here propose two new synchronization approaches, which are based on diﬀerential
correlation and are referred to as Doubly-Diﬀerential (DD) [42] and Simply-Diﬀerential (SD)
[43] approaches. Both of the proposed approaches allow time synchronization by detecting
the start of a ZC sequence within the received signal. The SD approach carries simultaneous
autocorrelation and compensation of the received signal with a frequency shift whose value
depends on the sent ZC sequence. The DD approach sums the doubly-diﬀerential correlated
consecutive samples to detect a ZC sequence pattern regardless of the sent ZC sequence. Both
of the proposed diﬀerential correlation based approaches (DD and SD) can be implemented in
a recursive way, which allows to greatly reduce the incurred computational load.
115

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
Recently, ZC sequences have been employed in the 3GPP LTE and LTE-Advanced stan-
dards, as frequency domain training sequences, for Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL) synchro-
nization. It is known that the IFFT of a ZC sequence remains a ZC sequence, yet with diﬀerent
parameters. Hence, the proposed synchronization techniques, based on ZC sequence use in the
temporal domain, can be applied with some adaptations to the LTE standard for primary syn-
chronization. This latter consists in detecting the symbol start as well as the Sector Identiﬁer
(S-ID) and it exploits the dedicated Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) which is made from
ZC sequences. In this case, the DD approach proceeds in two stages, wherein the ﬁrst stage
a coarse time estimation is achieved by localizing the arrival of a ZC sequence. In the second
stage, cross-correlation of the received signal with the local known ZC sequence candidates
is carried to detect the exact PSS start and the S-ID. Unlike the conventional methods that
perform the cross-correlation over all demodulated OFDM symbols, the DD approach carries it
over a short interval centered on the coarse time estimate, which greatly reduces its complexity.
The SD approach achieves time synchronization and sector search in a sole stage, which is a
particular feature compared to the existing detectors and the herein proposed DD approach, in
which the S-ID is always determined by cross-correlation with the local known ZC sequences
(or PSS) candidates.
At the end of this chapter, a comparison of the proposed SD and DD approaches to some
existing primary synchronization benchmarks is provided for system parameters and channel
conditions diﬀerent from the works in [42] and [43].

Proposed Synchronization Techniques
This section is devoted to describe the proposed time synchronization approaches based on ZC
sequences. We ﬁrst recall the rule to generate the complex exponential ZC sequence, which we
here denote by du. The ZC sequence is given by

Nzc
, 0 ≤n ≤Nzc −1,
(6.1)
where Nzc stands for the sequence length and u refers to the root of the ZC sequence rela-
tively prime to Nzc. It was shown in [85] that circular shifted versions of a ZC sequences are
uncorrelated from each other which makes them excellent candidates for time synchronization.

d−1rd−1−q denote the correlation output of the dth received sample which will
be summed in the metric MDD(d). For weakly correlated samples, the diﬀerential correlation
output has low value. Whereas, for d values corresponding to samples taken from the ZC
sequence, mDD(d) turns into
mDD(d) = du(d)d∗
u(d −q)d∗
u(d −1)du(d −1 −q)
= e−j2πu
d
Nzc ej2πu (d−q)
Nzc
= e−j 2πuq
Nzc .
(6.3)
We then note that mDD(d) is independent of d when it includes samples falling within the ZC
sequence and it has a constant value equal to e−j 2πuq
Nzc . Hence, the metric in equation (6.2)
sums constructively and, as shown in ﬁgure 6.1, its amplitude |MDD| exhibits a triangular
shape that reaches its maximum at the ZC sequence start where it sums over the Nzc samples
of constant values.
As can be seen through equation (6.2), the metric MDD has a heavy complexity due to
diﬀerential correlation operations. To decrease its computational load, we propose a reduced-
complexity recursive implementation of (6.2) using the following formula
MDD(d + 1) = MDD(d) −mDD(d) + mDD(d + Nzc).
(6.4)
Using the timing metric expression in (6.2), the calculation of each element requires 3Nzc
complex multiplication operations, which results in a huge computational load. However, only
6 complex multiplication operations are required using the recursive form of the metric (6.4),
which allows to save 3Nzc −6 complex multiplication operations per metric evaluation with
117

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
2 more complex addition operations, whose computational load is negligible compared to the
complex multiplication operations.
6.1.2
Simply-Diﬀerential Approach
The Simply-Diﬀerential (SD) approach makes the detection faster as it requires lower number
of complex multiplications.
We here suggest a timing metric in which the received signal
is autocorrelated and compensated with a frequency oﬀset whose value depends on the ZC
sequence used in the preamble generation.
Let us deﬁne λl as the diﬀerential correlation outcome of the lth received sample with its
q-shifted counterpart: λl = r∗
l rl+q. When the received samples belong to the ZC sequence and
under noiseless conditions (ideal channel), λl becomes
λl = ejπul(l+1)/Nzce−jπu(l+q)(l+q+1)/Nzc
= e−jπu(2ql+q2+q)/Nzc.
(6.5)
When compensated with its complex conjugate, λl turns into a constant for samples falling
within the ZC sequence.
We exploit this feature to deﬁne the metric Mu
SD that sums the
compensated elements over Nzc samples as
Mu
SD(d) =
Nzc−1
X
l=0
λd+lej πu
Nzc
 2q(d+l)+q2+q

,
(6.6)
where u stands for the root of the known ZC sequence which is used in the preamble generation.
As shown in ﬁgure 6.1, the magnitude of the metric Mu
SD provides a triangular shape, similarly
to the metric MDD, whose maximum value indicates the start of the ZC sequence. Continuously
calculating the metric Mu
SD in (6.6) leads to an exhaustive treatment complexity load lower
than that of the DD approach, yet it is still high. Hence, for complexity reduction, we propose
a recursive implementation of Mu
SD as
Mu
SD(d + 1) = Mu
SD(d) −mu
SD(d) + mu
SD(d + Nzc),
(6.7)
where
mu
SD(d) = λde
jπu
Nzc (2qd+q2+q).
(6.8)
118

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
In the initial metric (6.6), the computation of each element Mu
SD(d) requires 2Nzc complex
multiplication operations. However, the expression in (6.7) reduces this number to only 4 with
additional 2 complex addition operations whose computational load is triﬂing compared to that
of the complex multiplication operation. Thus, 2Nzc −4 complex multiplication operations
(96%) are saved.
Figure 6.1: The proposed doubly-diﬀerential and simply-diﬀerential metrics (MDD and MSD)
under noiseless conditions.
The timing metrics of the DD and SD approaches are depicted in ﬁgure 6.1 for a ZC sequence
of length Nzc = 63 and root u = 25. The peaks of the metrics indicate the start of the ZC
sequence sent directly in the time domain and which is here preceded by random data.
It was shown in [90] that the IFFT of a ZC sequence maintains its properties and remains
a ZC sequence, which makes the herein proposed synchronization techniques available for ZC
sequences deﬁned in the time domain extensible to the case of ZC deﬁned in the frequency
domain. Hence, they can be applied in numerous existing standards and in particular to the
3GPP LTE standard as explained in the next section.

Application to the 3GPP LTE Standard
This section is devoted to describe the application of the proposed DD and SD synchronization
approaches to the LTE standard for DL primary synchronization. This task includes the detec-
tion of the synchronization signal, which is made from ZC sequence, and the sector identiﬁer.
To this aim, we ﬁrst provide a state of the art of the LTE standard and existing synchronization
techniques in LTE. Then, the proposed techniques are presented when applied to the consid-
ered standard with the incorporation of the required modiﬁcations for ZC sequences deﬁned
in the frequency domain.
6.2.1
State of the Art of LTE Standard
6.2.1.1
LTE Signal Description
The LTE as deﬁned by the 3GPP is an innovative wireless communication standard which
provides peak rates of at least 100 Mbps and 50 Mbps for DL and UL respectively and it
supports scalable bandwidth from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz. The wide range of system bandwidths
helps to operate in a large number of diﬀerent spectrum allocations. LTE also supports both
Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) and Time-Division Duplex (TDD). By oﬀering highly ﬂex-
ible radio interface, LTE suits the needs of diﬀerent network operators that have diﬀerent
bandwidth allocations. Compared to the traditional communication networks, many innova-
tive techniques are applied to improve the LTE capabilities. Among them, the OFDM which is
known by its robustness to frequency-selective channels is used for the DL transmission [116].
For the UL, where the available transmission power is signiﬁcantly lower than that for the
DL, single-carrier transmission based on DFT-precoded OFDM, also referred to as single-
carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA), is used. Having smaller PAPR than the
OFDM, the SC-FDMA technique enables lower complex and/or higher-power terminals [117],
which improves coverage and reduces terminal cost and power consumption.
Before a User Equipment (UE) can communicate through an LTE network it has to acquire
synchronization to a cell within the network. Precisely, it should accomplish primary synchro-
nization which consists in detecting the PSS start and determining the S-ID. In addition, the
secondary synchronization has to be processed, which aims to identify the sub-frame num-
ber and the cell group identiﬁer. For the secondary synchronization, the LTE standard uses
120

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
the Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS) which also has a speciﬁc structure and is made
from m-sequences. There are 504 diﬀerent physical-layer cell-ID which are grouped into 168
groups identiﬁed by a number N(1)
ID (ranging from 0 to 167), where each group consists of three
identities speciﬁed by a number N(2)
ID (ranging from 0 to 2). The cell-ID is then determined as
CID = 3N(1)
ID + N(2)
ID.
(6.9)
The parameter N(2)
ID represents the sector identiﬁer (S-ID) of each cell, which is strongly related
to the PSS, whereas the parameter N(1)
ID represents the physical-layer group identiﬁer and is
sent on the SSS.
a) Downlink Frame Structure
In LTE systems, the transmitted signal is organized into radio frames of 10ms duration, each
consisting of 10 sub-frames of length 1ms which are further divided into two slots of 0.5ms
each. In case of FDD, all sub-frames of a carrier are used for either DL transmission or UL
transmission. On the other hand, in case of TDD, the ﬁrst and sixth sub-frames of each frame
(sub-frame 0 and 5) are always assigned for DL transmission, while the remaining sub-frames
can be ﬂexibly assigned to be used for either DL or UL transmissions. We here focus on the
former mode, whose frame structure is presented in ﬁgure 6.2. We note that depending on
whether normal or extended CP is used, a slot contains 7 or 6 OFDM symbols of duration
equal to 66.7µs each. Among them, the LTE system reserves two symbols for the PSS and
the SSS. Synchronization signals are sent regularly (in each sub-frame) in the last two OFDM
symbols of slot 0 and slot 10. Transmitted data are mapped on a time-frequency resource
grid consisting of elementary units, called resource elements, deﬁned as one 15 kHz sub-carrier
by one symbol.
Resource elements aggregate into resource blocks having dimension of 12
consecutive sub-carriers in the frequency domain over 6 OFDM symbols for extended CP or 7
OFDM symbols for normal CP. The ﬁrst symbol in each frame has a longer CP with length
denoted by Ng1 [115].
We note that in the case of TDD mode, the PSS is transmitted within the third symbol of
sub-frames 1 and 6 while the SSS is transmitted in the last symbol of sub-frames 0 and 5.
121

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
Figure 6.2: LTE frame structure in the FDD mode: 7 OFDM symbols with normal CP [116].
b) Primary Synchronization Signal
In one cell, the two PSSs within a frame are identical. The PSS is generated from one of
three known ZC sequences du(n) introduced in equation (6.1), with root u ∈{25, 29, 34} that
corresponds to the S-ID (N(2)
ID ∈{0, 1, 2}).
The ZC sequences have a length of Nzc = 63
samples and are used in frequency-domain to modulate sub-carriers. The PSS structure is
reported in ﬁgure 6.3. We note that the 32nd sample is omitted to avoid modulating the DC
sub-carrier and only 62 samples of the ZC sequence are mapped on the 62 centered sub-carriers
in the transmission bandwidth. Furthermore, the PSS occupies 6 resource blocks which makes
72 sub-carriers for it (ﬁve resource elements at each side of the synchronization sequence are
set to zero) [115].
The corresponding time-domain signal can be generated using an IFFT of size Nu. The size
of the IFFT depends on the system bandwidth. Sub-carriers that are not used for transmission
of synchronization signals can be used for data transmission [115].

6.2.1.2
LTE Primary Synchronization Literature Review
In LTE systems, the primary synchronization involves symbol start estimation and S-ID de-
termination. We here provide a survey on some existing approaches for each of these tasks.
Extensive researches have been done on the primary synchronization in LTE systems. Among
them, the methods proposed in [118] and [119] exploit the redundancy in the CP to accom-
plish symbol start detection in a blind manner. Then, the sector ID is determined through
cross-correlating the three local known ZC sequence candidates to the demodulated OFDM
symbols. In [119], non-diﬀerential correlation as well as diﬀerential correlation are used and are
found to be more appropriate for long and short channel delay spread respectively, while only
non-diﬀerential correlation is used in [118]. In [120], the CP based autocorrelation algorithm
is also performed to identify the coarse symbol start. Then, the accurate symbol start and
S-ID are estimated by cross-correlating the PSS candidates to the received signal over a short
interval around the coarse symbol start estimates. The approach proposed in [121] introduces
a new concept for coarse timing synchronization which exploits the whole slot to detect the
frame start. Accurate detection is provided but a high computational load is required. Low-
Complexity synchronization and cell search scheme was proposed in [122], which exploits the
central-symmetric property of the ZC sequences to ﬁrst localize it. Then, the S-ID search can
be performed in either time or frequency domains. Analytical descriptions of these approaches
are hereafter given.
a) Symbol Start Estimation
Most of the existing time synchronization approaches use the famous blind Maximum Likeli-
hood (ML) estimator which exploits the redundancy induced by the CP in the OFDM signal
123

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
structure. Among them, the works in [118] and [119] estimate the symbol start, respecting the
algorithm initially proposed for OFDM systems in [24], and which is recalled in section 3.2.1
through equations (3.9), (3.10), (3.11) and (3.12).
The ML symbol start estimator proposed in [120] is derived by maximizing the P-lagged
autocorrelation deﬁned as
C(d) =

W−1
X
l=0
r∗
d+lrd+q+l
,
(6.10)
were q stands for the correlation shift. For a given sliding window size W = Ng and for q = Nu,
the symbol start estimate turns into the initial estimate in [24] which is also used in [118,119].
An enhancement of this estimator can be achieved by using a total of K OFDM symbols to
get an equivalent CP of length KNg and average out the noise eﬀect.
In [121], a diﬀerent concept for time synchronization is proposed. The idea therein is to
detect the start point of a whole LTE slot instead of one OFDM symbol start. The timing
metric is expressed as
M(d) =
 
|P(d)|
R(d)
!2
,
(6.11)
where

(6.13)
The slot start coincides with the argument d that maximizes the timing metric M(d) in equation
(6.11). This latter allows determining the PSS position, as it is known with reference to the slot
start, yet it does not enable the S-ID identiﬁcation. This scheme shows good time detection
124

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
performance for AWGN channel. However, its performance is much limited when the received
data is deteriorated due to multipath eﬀects.
By exploiting the central-symmetric property of ZC sequences, distinguishing the PSS sym-
bol from the data symbols can be simply achieved by the Central-Self Correlation (CSC) as
in [122] which veriﬁes whether a received symbol is central symmetric or not as
Z(d) =

Nu/2−1
X
l=0
r∗
d+lrd+Nu−1−l
.
(6.14)
Performing the metric above, the UE can quickly know whether a received symbol is a PSS sym-
bol or not by carrying only one self-correlation operation searching for the central-symmetric
property of ZC sequences, which always holds regardless of the root u. The PSS start is selected
as the time index d that maximizes the metric in equation (6.14).
b) Sector Search
After achieving time synchronization, by detecting either the PSS start (exploiting ZC se-
quence properties) or other OFDM symbol start (exploiting OFDM symbols structure), which
we hereafter denote by ˆτ, sector search can be carried in either time domain (before FFT
application) or frequency domain (after FFT application). The sector ID strongly depends on
the ZC sequence used in the PSS generation. Most of the existing algorithms detect the PSS
symbol by exploiting the ZC sequences' near-perfect cross-correlation properties.
The algorithm in [118] cross-correlates the received extracted symbols R (after FFT) with
the three local ZC sequences du on the 62 centered sub-carriers as
Qu(d) =

Nzc−1
X
l=0,l̸=31
d∗
u(l)R(d + l)
.
(6.15)
The magnitude of the cross-correlator output Qu(d) corresponding to the correct sector ID
provides the highest correlation peak. This is the consequence of orthogonality between ZC
sequences used in the PSS generation. Also, the index d that maximizes Qu(d) indicates the
PSS position within the radio frame.
The detector proposed in [119] adapts the metric to the channel delay spread. Indeed, it
125

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
uses a non-diﬀerential correlation based metric that proceeds as in equation (6.15) for short
channels and a diﬀerential correlation based metric for long channels as
Cu(d) =

Nzc−2
X
l=0

d∗
u(l)R(d + l)

d∗
u(l + 1)R(d + l + 1)
∗
.
(6.16)
Here, the diﬀerential correlation is also carried for the extracted middle 62 sub-carriers of each
OFDM demodulated symbol. Simulation results provided in [119] show that non-diﬀerential
correlation works better for short channels whereas diﬀerential correlation is more adequate in
the case of long memory channels.
The main drawback of the above cited approaches is that the OFDM symbols should be
extracted out in frequency domain in advance which may distort the synchronization signals
due to synchronization errors. Furthermore, the coarse synchronization is blind, which makes
the detection unsatisfactory in the case of multipath fading channels.
The algorithm proposed in [120] performs cross-correlation in time domain with the PSS
candidates at all possible symbol starts (previously estimated through blind approach) and
neighborhoods. The correlation peak occurs at the eﬀective PSS symbol start, from which
a more accurate symbol start can also be obtained.
Similarly to the previous algorithms,
the cross-correlation is here performed at all symbol start positions which may result in a
high computational load. The large amount of computation wasted on the data symbols is
avoided in [122] since the PSS acquisition is realized during the coarse time synchronization
process. Then, the S-ID search can be performed in either the frequency domain as done in
equation (6.15) during one symbol, or in time domain exploiting the central symmetry of the
ZC sequences as
Ωu(d) =
Du(0)r∗
ˆτ + Du(Nu/2 −1)r∗

∗

2
,
(6.17)
where Du stands for the IFFT of the ZC sequence du which is also a ZC sequence.
The
metric Ωu(d) is here carried for each root u. The CSC algorithm avoids the large amount
of computation wasted on the data symbols, which dominates the complexity of the S-ID
acquisition in the conventional approaches [118]- [120], by detecting the central-symmetric
pattern of the PSS during the ﬁrst synchronization stage. Nevertheless, the complexity of the
coarse stage remains high and may not be suitable for fast synchronization in the UE.
126

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
For more accurate time detection and lower computational load, we apply the two primary
synchronization approaches: the SD approach that proceeds in a single stage for joint PSS start
estimation and sector search and the DD approach which provides a coarse PSS start estimate
from the ﬁrst stage and carries a ﬁne stage for ﬁne time estimation and S-ID detection. The
principle of the latter approach is similar to the CSC algorithm, yet the coarse stage of the
proposed DD approach has much lower computational load.
6.2.2
Application of the Proposed DD Approach
In LTE systems, the ZC sequence is sent in frequency domain (modulates the sub-carriers) and
is transformed through IFFT application. We here exploit the duality between ZC sequences
in time and frequency domains, which states that the IFFT of a ZC sequence remains a ZC
sequence [90]. This property shows the possibility of adapting and applying the previously
proposed DD approach, in which ZC sequences are exploited in the time domain, to the LTE
system. The primary synchronization is achieved in two stages: a ﬁrst coarse doubly diﬀerential
correlation based stage, whose aim is to roughly localize the arrival time of a ZC sequence within
the received signal, and a second ﬁne cross-correlation based stage whose aim is to provide the
exact ZC sequence start and the S-ID.
Identically to the previous time domain case, the coarse metric MDD(d) in equation (6.2) is
here processed onto the received signal, yet with a sum of Nu adjacent samples (not necessarily
equal to Nzc, corresponding to the oversampled ZC sequence length) given by
MDD(d) =

Nu−1
X
l=0

rd+lr∗
d+l−q

rd+l−1r∗
d+l−1−q
∗
.
(6.18)
This expression can also be implemented by a recursive formula similar to that in (6.4) using
a shift equal to Nu instead of Nzc in the last term. Compared to most of the symbol start
detectors described in section 6.2.1.2, the DD approach has the advantage of providing a coarse
estimate of the PSS start from the ﬁrst stage. Hence, the ﬁne search is carried only over one
symbol (the PSS). Furthermore, a ﬂexible (time domain or frequency domain) cross-correlation
based sector search is now possible.
In the time domain based search, cross-correlation is
performed between the three local PSS candidates (Du) and a short-length sequence centered
127

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
on the coarse PSS start estimate extracted from the received signal as
Mu
FDD(d) =

Nu−1
X
l=0
D∗
u(l)rd+l
 .
(6.19)
The time index that maximizes the correlation output indicates the PSS start and the candidate
Du that provides the highest peak among the three candidates corresponds to the ZC sequence
of root u that identiﬁes the sector. In the frequency domain based search, the coarse PSS start
estimate is considered as a trigger FFT point. Once the ZC sequence is extracted after FFT
application to the estimated PSS, the cross-correlation is carried as done in [118] and [119] and
described in equation (6.15).
6.2.3
Application of the Proposed SD Approach
The previous equations (6.6) and (6.7) are provided for ZC sequences directly sent in time
domain, which is not the case in LTE speciﬁcations. Once again, we exploit the fact that the
IFFT of a ZC sequence preserves its properties and remains a ZC sequence, yet with a modiﬁed
root u′. Hence, the metric in (6.6) is applicable in the LTE system using the new ZC sequence
resulting from the IFFT of the original ZC sequence whose root is u′ and length is Nu. In
this case, the sum in the metric (6.6) must be carried from 0 to Nu −1 and the compensation
term for the dth index becomes e
j2πdu′q
Nu
. As u′ is unknown, we propose to determine oﬀ-line
the optimal compensation frequency δ = u′q/Nu, which oﬀers near-best performance, for each
of the three possible ZC sequences. To this aim, we use the function below for each initial root
u, in order to search the compensation frequency that maximizes the correlation output of the
new ZC sequence to its q-shifted counterpart, deﬁned as
F u(δ, q) =

Nu−1
X
l=0
Du(l)D∗
u(l + q)e−j2πlδ
.
(6.20)
In the sequel, we search the couple (δ,q) which maximizes F u(δ, q) and hence provides the
best compensation (adjustment) frequency δ for each of the three initial ZC sequences. The
search of q and δ is achieved through simulation.
128

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
6.2.3.1
Search of the Optimal Shift q
The aim of this task is to determine the optimal shift q that provides the highest maxi-
mum value of F u(δ, q).
Hence, for all possible shift values q we sum F u(δ, q) throughout
δ ∈{0, δτ, 2δτ, ..., (Nu −1)δτ} values as
Gu(q) =
(Nu−1)δτ
X
δ=0
F u(δ, q), q ∈[1, Nu −1].
(6.21)
Figure 6.4 shows the curves of the shift search function for the three standardized roots using
a step δτ = 1 for Nu = 2048. It is shown that each correlation shift q provides diﬀerent value
which, unlike the case of using ZC sequences in time domain, results in diﬀerent performance.
We note that the curves drawn for root values 29 and 34 are superimposed. For each root u,
the optimal shift that maximizes the search metric in (6.21), which we denote by qu
opt, is used
in the next step to search for the optimal ﬁne compensation frequency δ and is retained to be
utilized in the SD metric (6.6) for time synchronization (using new parameters).
Figure 6.4: The optimal correlation shift search metric for diﬀerent roots u.
We notice a symmetry in the curves of the function Gu(q), drawn in ﬁgure 6.4, which allows
its calculation for a range of length Nu/2.

6.2.3.2
Search of the Optimal Compensation Frequency δ
For each initial ZC sequence with root u, the search of the best compensation frequency is
carried in two phases through the metric F u(δ, q) deﬁned in equation (6.20). First a coarse
frequency δc is determined using a relatively large step δτ and the optimized shift qu
opt. Then,
F u(δ) is reﬁned around δc with a very thin step to get a ﬁner compensation frequency δf.
Figure 6.5 shows the curves of δf search around δc for the optimal shift values qu
opt.

opt) for diﬀerent roots

The three arguments δf (for the three ZC initial roots) which maximize F u(δ, qu
opt) will be
used at the receiver side to calculate the SD timing metric.
6.2.3.3
Application of the SD metric
Once the optimal correlation shift qu
opt and the compensation frequency δu
f are determined, the
SD metric must be calculated three times (for each deﬁned root u ∈{25, 34, 39}) using the
sequence λl = r∗

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
The metric Mu
SD(d) which exhibits the highest maximum among the three calculated metrics
is considered for primary synchronization. Indeed, the corresponding root u indicates the S-ID
while the argument d that maximizes the metric corresponds to the PSS start. The joint time
synchronization and sector search procedures is a particular feature of the SD synchronization
approach compared to the herein proposed DD approach and the considered benchmarks. It is
worth noting that a recursive implementation of the SD metric respecting the equation (6.7)
can further be used to reduce the computational load of the metric calculation.
The ﬁgure 6.6 presents the DD and SD coarse metrics drawn in both cases where ZC
sequences are deﬁned in time (a) and frequency (b) domains. It is shown in ﬁgure 6.6.b that
when carrying the metrics onto the LTE signal and for the correct root, the triangular shape is
kept with a gap wider than that of the time-domain based metrics and they exhibit a plateau
of length equal to the CP length minus the channel memory. As a second ﬁne stage is required
in the DD approach, the plateau will be eliminated through the cross-correlation. For the SD
approach, we propose two processing to overcome the plateau eﬀect. The ﬁrst one consists in
locating the points to the left and right, which are 90% of the timing metric maximum, average
these two values positions and add Ng/2 samples to ﬁnd the PSS start estimate. The second
process cross-correlates the estimated PSS to one of the local three known PSS candidates,
corresponding to the estimated S-ID.

Performance Evaluation and Comparison
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed time synchronization and sector
search approaches and compare them to the considered benchmarks: Approach 1 proposed
in [118], Approach 2 proposed in [119] and the CSC-based PSS detector proposed in [122].

PSS to the local known one is referred to by SD-1 and the processing that selects the middle
point of the plateau whose magnitude is of 90% of the absolute maximum is denoted by SD-2.
We recall that Approach 1 and 2 use a ML estimator for time synchronization to extract the
OFDM symbols. To further improve the time synchronization performance in Approach 1 and
Approach 2, averaging processing over the whole slot is adopted as explained in [26]. For sector
search and ﬁne PSS start detection, a second stage is carried based on cross-correlating the
62 centered sub-carriers of the extracted OFDM symbols to the local known ZC sequences.
Non-diﬀerential cross-correlation is used in Approach 1, whereas Approach 2 uses diﬀerential
cross-correlation based metric. The CSC algorithm exploits the central-symmetric property
of the ZC sequence for PSS localization (time synchronization). Then, a time or frequency
domain cross-correlation of the estimated PSS with the local known three ZC sequences or
their IFFT is carried for sector identiﬁcation.
Time synchronization performance is evaluated in terms of PSS start Correct Detection Rate
(CDR), deﬁned as the percentage of realizations where the estimated time index coincides with
the correct PSS start and its estimation variance. Sector search performance is evaluated in
terms of S-ID Failure Detection Rate (FDR) deﬁned as the percentage of realizations where
the estimated S-ID is erroneous. It is worth to note that in the curves reporting the CDR, we
tolerate a mismatch of 2 and 4 samples centered on the correct PSS start in the case of Extended
Pedestrian A (EPA) and Extended Typical Urban (ETU) channel models respectively.

PSS Detection Performance
Figure 6.7 displays the PSS start CDR in the EPA channel (Fig. 6.7.a) and the ETU channel
(Fig. 6.7.b) of the compared approaches. The obtained results show that the proposed SD
approach outperforms the other approaches in terms of time detection accuracy. Indeed, it
is shown in ﬁgure 6.7.a that for a target CDR of 80%, it realizes gains of about 1 dB, 1.8
dB and 4 dB compared to the DD approach, the CSC approach and the Approaches 1 and
2 respectively. The DD and CSC schemes provide comparable detection performance with a
slight gain of about 0.3 dB realized by the DD scheme at high SNR and by the CSC scheme
at low SNR. These two schemes outperform Approaches 1 and 2, which provide almost the
same detection accuracy, with gains of about 2 dB and 5 dB respectively for low and high SNR
values. We also note that for high SNR values, all the considered benchmarks and the DD
approach outperform the SD-1, which uses the averaging technique to determine the PSS start.
The CDR curves depicted in ﬁgure 6.7.b, for the case of ETU channel, show that consistently
with the EPA channel case, the SD approach (SD-1) outperforms the other approaches. These
latters (DD, CSC, App.1 and App. 2) provide almost the same detection accuracy for SNR
values lower than -4 dB. Beyond this value, the DD and CSC schemes greatly outperform the
Approaches 1 and 2 whose maximum CDR stagnates at values lower than 75%. Both of the

higher than 6 dB.

Figure 6.8 draws the time estimation variance in the EPA channel (Fig. 6.8.a) and the
ETU channel (Fig. 6.8.b). The same observations as for the CDR are noticed through the
curves of estimation variances. We note, in ﬁgure 6.8.a, that the SD approach exhibits low
variance compared to all other approaches, but due to the plateau eﬀect, an error of about
5.10−3 squared samples remains even at high SNR values. This phenomenon is observed in
134

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
all the compared PSS detectors. The DD and CSC approaches are the most sensitive to noise
compared to the other approaches and they provide the highest variances at low SNR values.
For this SNR range, they provide almost the same detection accuracy, whereas, for higher
SNR values, the former scheme outperforms the latter one with a minimum gain of about 2
dB. We also note that the Approaches 1 and 2 provide almost the same detection performance
in terms of PSS start detection accuracy and its estimation variance. Consistently with the
CDR evaluation and at high SNR, the variance of the scheme SD-2 is the highest one. In ﬁgure
6.8.b, it is also proved that the scheme SD-1 is more eﬃcient than the other schemes along the
considered SNR range. At very low SNR values (<-2 dB), the DD approach has the highest
variance while the considered benchmarks provide slightly lower variances. Beyond this SNR
value, the variance of the DD estimator is greatly reduced such to oﬀer an estimation variance
comparable to that provided by the SD-1 (a value of 0.1). Moreover, the CSC estimation
variance is also improved, yet it stagnates at value higher than 10 squared samples. However,
the other approaches (SD-2, App.1 and App.2) are still exhibit high estimation variances.
(a) EPA-5 channel
(b) ETU-300 channel
Figure 6.8: PSS start estimation variance.
In both of the considered channel models, the performance provided by Approach 1 and
2 are very close and their limitation is due to the blind coarse time estimation known by its
sensitivity to the multipath eﬀect. Indeed, the herein proposed approaches (SD and DD) and
the CSC approach, which exploit the ZC sequence properties to ﬁrst detect the arrival of the
135

Chapter 6. Simply and Doubly Diﬀerential Synchronization: Zadoﬀ-Chu Sequences
PSS, greatly outperform the other approaches. Although the DD and the CSC approaches
have the same principle, the performance provided are almost the same in low SNR, however
the DD approach outperforms the CSC approach, for high SNR values. This may be due to the
calculation of the ﬁne metric, which is centered on the coarse PSS start for the DD approach
while it starts from the coarse estimate in the CSC approach.
6.3.3
Sector ID Search Performance
The sector ID Failure Detection Rate (FDR) is illustrated in ﬁgure 6.9. We note that all the
compared approaches (Approach 1, Approach 2, CSC and the proposed SD and DD approaches)
provide satisfactory detection performance with very low FDR even at low SNR values. In
both of the considered channels the SD approach provides the best sector search detection
performance, which becomes perfect from SNR values equal to -6 dB and -4 dB in the EPA
and ETU channels respectively. In the EPA channel case, reported in 6.9.(a), Approach 2
outperforms the other benchmarks and the DD proposed approach and it realizes slight gains
of about 0.5 dB, 1 dB and 1.5 dB compared to respectively Approach 2, the DD and the CSC
approaches. In 6.9.(b), the FDR is presented in the case of ETU channel. We here note a
perfect sector search achieved from SNR values of -4 dB for the SD approach, -2 dB for the
three considered benchmarks and 0 dB for the proposed DD approach, which here provides
the highest FDR.

Complexity Issues
Computational complexity comparison among the considered benchmarks as well as the pro-
posed DD and SD approaches is here evaluated and presented in table 6.3. The evaluation is
assessed in terms of Number of Complex Multiplication operations (NCM) required to accom-
plish the primary synchronization processing (symbol start detection and sector search) during
one slot. We deﬁne the slot length as Nsl = 7Nu + 6Ng + Ng1.

It is observed, in table 6.3, that the non-diﬀerential correlation based approach (App. 1) has
the lowest computational complexity compared to the other approaches, yet with poor detection
performance. Slightly higher NCM is required in the SD approach with a great improvement
of the detection performance. Although the diﬀerential-correlation based approach (App. 2) is
much more costly, its performance are comparable to those of Approach 1 and the DD approach
in terms of sector search.
Indeed, numbers of 487 104 and 72 104 complex multiplication
operations are saved by Approach 2 and the DD approach, respectively. This latter has much
lower computational load than that of Approach 1 and, as presented in the previous simulation
results, it greatly outperforms it in terms of PSS detection accuracy.
The CSC approach
has the highest complexity with better performance, compared to Approaches 1 and 2 whose
complexity is reduced thanks to the recursive implementation. The CSC approach was known
do decrease the computational load in [122] compared to the conventional approaches (App.
1 and App. 2). However, the recursive implementation of the conventional approaches leads
to an important complexity reduction. Although the CSC approach allows PSS localization
from the ﬁrst synchronization task, as in the proposed DD and SD approaches, the recursive
implementation of these latter makes them more convenient. Overall, we note that the SD
approach provides the best trade-oﬀbetween the computational complexity and the detection
performance.

Conclusions
In this chapter we presented two new synchronization approaches for time synchronization
exploiting ZC sequences. These methods are then adapted to be applied in the case of LTE
standard, which employs ZC sequences in the frequency domain as a PSS for time synchro-
nization and S-ID search.
The doubly-diﬀerential correlation approach proceeds into two stages wherein the ﬁrst stage
a coarse metric of reduced complexity is calculated to detect the pattern of a ZC sequence
within the received signal.
Then, to exactly locate the PSS start, a ﬁne metric based on
cross-correlating the received signal with the three known PSS candidates is carried over a
short interval around the coarse time estimate. This process allows determining the PSS start
and the S-ID identiﬁed by the maximum of the peaks resulting from the three correlation
outputs. Unlike the conventional approaches and the herein proposed doubly-diﬀerential one,
the simply-diﬀerential approach has the particularity of combining time synchronization and
sector search in a single stage. Indeed, the same metric was used to jointly detect the PSS start
and determine the sector ID. Furthermore, its reduced complexity, compared to the considered
benchmarks, makes it suitable to working in a high-mobility environment with a frequent
handover being performed.
Simulation results, investigated in the EPA and the ETU channels, showed the robustness
of the proposed approaches even at very low SNR values. The doubly-diﬀerential approach
has a computational load comparable to that of the conventional approaches, yet with slight
enhancement in the detection accuracy. The simply-diﬀerential approach provides the best
performance in terms of detection accuracy and computational load, when compared to the
benchmarks and to the doubly-diﬀerential approach. Moreover, the complexity comparison
results showed that, although the PSS localization during the ﬁrst synchronization stage was
treated in former work, the recursive implementation of both proposed approaches greatly
relaxes the computational load of the proposed synchronization processing.

Synchronization in STBC
MISO-OFDM Systems
The combination of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology with the OFDM mod-
ulation technique has been recognized as one of the most promising techniques to provide high
data rate through spatial multiplexing, and robust reception through spatial diversity. Conﬁgu-
ration with single transmit antenna, known as Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO), or single
receive antenna, known as Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO), have also some interesting
advantages as the MIMO conﬁguration. Furthermore, MIMO-OFDM technique transforms a
frequency selective MIMO channel into a number of ﬂat-fading MIMO channels on each sub-
carrier, which allows to take advantages from both techniques. Nevertheless, as in the case of
single antenna OFDM systems, synchronization errors are still a major problem for MIMO-
OFDM systems that cause severe degradation in the system performance. Therefore, residual
synchronization errors must be estimated and compensated.
In this chapter, we propose a new synchronization technique for non-coherent MISO-OFDM
systems [44].
The proposed scheme exploits a preamble of two identical parts from which
diﬀerent versions are generated and simultaneously transmitted from all transmit antennas.
The chapter begins with a brief presentation of the MIMO-OFDM systems with a focus on
the MIMO key features: spatial diversity, spatial multiplexing and the tradeoﬀbetween them.
Then, the proposed synchronization technique is presented. It exploits diﬀerential Alamouti
space-time block coding/decoding to provide full spatial diversity and to avoid the channel
139

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
estimation required in the coherent Alamouti coding scheme. The proposed synchronization
technique proceeds in two stages similarly to the RC technique described in chapter 4: an
autocorrelation based coarse stage and a cross-correlation based ﬁne stage. The ﬁrst stage is
carried directly using the received signal to roughly localize the preamble. Then, diﬀerential
Alamouti decoding must be achieved to recover the transmitted signal before calculating the
cross-correlation based ﬁne metric to detect the exact preamble start.
In the last part of
the chapter, to better assess the performance of the proposed synchronization technique, we
compare it to the single antenna conﬁguration and to the MISO conﬁguration with Alamouti
coding, under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge.
7.1
Basics of MIMO-OFDM systems
Multiple antennas can be employed at the transmitter (Nt) and/or the receiver (Nr) to form an
arrangement known as MIMO systems whose special case of Nt transmit antennas equal to 1
and Nr receive antennas also equal to 1 reduces to the traditional Single-Input Single-Output
(SISO) systems. Recently, MIMO conﬁguration has become a key technology for wideband
communication systems thanks to their potential to achieve higher data rate and provide
more reliable reception performance compared to the traditional SISO communication systems
[126, 127]. With the advent of MIMO systems, several schemes that beneﬁt particularly well
from the added spatial dimensions provided by multiple antennas have been emerged: spatial
multiplexing/demultiplexing [129, 130] achieve high spectral eﬃciency and provide higher bit
rate, while antenna subset selection and space-time coding [128] help to increase the reliability
of wireless links (spatial diversity).
7.1.1
MIMO Channel
Let us consider the MIMO channel with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas, then
the equivalent channel impulse response between the ith transmit antenna and the jth receive
antenna is denoted as hi,j(t). If the MIMO channel is assumed to be linear and time-invariant
during one symbol duration, the channel impulse response H can be characterized by an Nt×Nr
matrix as [57]

The equation (7.2) can be expressed in a matrix form as

(7.3)
where r(t) and η(t) stand for the received signal and noise vectors in CNr×1, respectively. The
vector s(t) ∈CNt×1 stands for the transmitted vector of complex symbols.
As shown in equation (7.2), the received signal consists in summing diﬀerent replicas of the
transmitted signal. These signals experience diﬀerent channel eﬀects, thus allowing a more
reliable recovery than the case of a single received signal. This key feature is known as spatial
diversity. Furthermore, if diﬀerent signals are transmitted through each antenna, the spectral
eﬃciency can be greatly enhanced through the so called spatial multiplexing.
7.1.1.1
Spatial Diversity
The transmitted signal over broadband wireless channels generally suﬀers from attenuation due
to the detrimental eﬀect of multipath fading, which can severely degrade the reception perfor-
mance, unless some additional less-attenuated replicas of the transmitted signal are provided.
This feature is known as diversity and is the most important factor in achieving reliable com-
munications [57]. Indeed, in a MIMO conﬁguration, the same information can be transmitted
from several antennas and received at several antennas simultaneously. Under the assumption
that the fading for each link between a pair of transmit and receive antennas is independent
from the others, the probability that the information is accurately received is increased when
compared to the single link scenario. Apart from the spatial diversity, other forms of diver-
sity are available, namely, temporal diversity and frequency diversity. Time diversity can be
141

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
obtained via coding and interleaving where the coded symbols are dispersed over time so that
diﬀerent replicas of the codeword experience independent fades. One can also exploit the fre-
quency diversity if the channel is frequency-selective, where replicas of the transmitted signal
are provided to the receiver in the form of redundancy in the frequency domain.
Several mechanisms are used to maximize the spatial diversity. These mechanisms include
delay diversity, Space-Time Block-Coding (STBC) [131, 132] and Space-Time Trellis-Coding
(STTC) [128]. In the ﬁrst transmit diversity approach, multiple delayed copies of the same
signal are transmitted through the Nt transmit antennas and a Maximum Likelihood Sequence
Estimation (MLSE) is used at the receiver to estimate the transmitted sequence. The delay-
diversity approach is simple and can be considered as a particular space-time code [14]. The
STBC and STTC coding schemes are developed for quasi-static ﬂat fading channels and can
provide full spatial diversity for MIMO systems. The STBC utilizes orthogonality property
of the used code to achieve full diversity, yet it can not achieve full-rate transmission when
the number of transmit antennas is greater than two [128]. On the other hand, the STTC
can guarantee full diversity by the use of enough trellis coding, but the decoding complexity
increases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas [14,57].
7.1.1.2
Spatial Multiplexing
It is widely recognized that the capacity of a MIMO system is much higher than that of a SISO
system. Indeed, Nt independent data streams can be simultaneously sent, each by a single
transmit antenna. This features is known as spatial multiplexing, which has good behavior
in environment with high scattering and high SNR. In such environment, the capacity of a
MIMO system grows proportionally with min(Nt, Nr). At the receiver side, spatial multiplexing
uses a dedicated detection algorithm to sort out diﬀerent transmitted signals from the mixed
corresponding signal, where at least Nr = Nt receive antennas are needed to ensure non
ambiguous recovery [60].
Layered approaches are used to increase capacity through spatial multiplexing including
Bell Labs Layered Space-Time (BLAST) schemes. For m-array modulation, the receiver has to
choose the most likely signal out of mNt possible signals in each symbol time interval. Therefore,
the receiver complexity grows exponentially with the number of modulation constellation points
and the number of transmit antennas. Two basic variants of BLAST are proposed in [129,
142

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
133], namely D-BLAST (Diagonal BLAST) and V-BLAST (Vertical BLAST). The diﬀerence
between them is that in V-BLAST the transmit antenna i corresponds, all the time, to the
transmitted data stream i, while in D-BLAST the assignment of the antenna to the transmitted
data stream is hopped periodically.
In general, the BLAST performance is limited due to
the error issued by the multi-stage decoding process.
However, the main disadvantage of
the BLAST architecture for mobile communications is the need for high numbers of receive
antennas (not practical in a small mobile terminal), without guaranteeing the achievement
of a full spatial diversity. Furthermore, high system complexity may prohibit the large-scale
implementation of such a scheme [57].
7.1.1.3
Diversity-Multiplexing Trade-oﬀ
The previous sections highlight two methods for using multiple antennas to improve the per-
formance of wireless communication systems.
The ﬁrst one exploits the diﬀerent channel
responses in order to obtain an optimized version of the transmitted signal through extracting
the maximal diversity gain. The second one uses the diﬀerent channels to increase the data
rate by multiplexing diﬀerent data streams simultaneously onto these channels. However, it
is not necessary to use the antennas exclusively for diversity or for multiplexing to enhance
the detection performance. Some of the space-time dimensions can be used for diversity gain,
while the remaining dimensions used for multiplexing gain. The trade-oﬀbetween diversity
and multiplexing gains has been extensively studied in the literature [135]- [138].
In [135], it is found that both types of gain (spatial diversity and multiplexing) can be
simultaneously obtained for a given MIMO channel with the fundamental trade-oﬀbetween
how much gain any coding scheme can extract of each type. Therefore, it is judicious to adapt
the diversity and multiplexing gains relative to channel conditions. In particular, more an-
tennas can be used for diversity gain in poor channel states, whereas in good channel states
the majority of antennas can be used for spatial multiplexing. In [136, 137], group detection
was shown as a key feature in designing schemes that achieve optimal diversity-multiplexing
trade-oﬀ. First, all transmit antennas are partitioned into G groups over which data is en-
coded and sent experiencing independent fading. Then, at the receiver group detection should
be used to separate and detect the G various groups. In [138], a framework for constructing
optimal coding/decoding schemes, which is referred to as LAttice Space-Time (LAST) cod-
ing/decoding, is also proposed for achieving the optimal diversity-multiplexing trade-oﬀ. More
143

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
recently, ﬁnite-SNR diversity-multiplexing trade-oﬀfor Rayleigh MIMO and spatially corre-
lated Rayleigh MIMO channels is studied respectively in [139] and [140], where dual antennas
at the transmitter and/or the receiver are considered. The ﬁnite-SNR schemes provided a new
insight to design Space Time Codes (STB) for practical MIMO systems optimized at realistic
SNRs and propagation environments.
The early research on the MIMO conﬁguration is based on the assumption of ﬂat fading
channels.
As higher bit rates involve wideband communications, wireless channels become
usually frequency selective.
To take advantage from diversity and/or spatial multiplexing
under frequency selective fading channels, MIMO conﬁguration must be used in conjunction
with other techniques that eﬀectively generate one or more ﬂat faded channel. A promising
candidate is the multi-carrier technique which divides the frequency-selective channel into
several ﬂat fading sub-channels. In particular, the OFDM technique is the most used with
MIMO conﬁguration thanks to its high spectral eﬃciency and capability to cope with multipath
eﬀects. Over each frequency, a MIMO ﬂat fading channel model will then be considered.
7.1.2
MIMO-OFDM
Recent and future broadband communication systems should provide high data rate and high
performance over wireless channels that are generally frequency selective. The combination of
MIMO and OFDM has the potential of meeting this stringent requirement since MIMO can
boost the capacity and the diversity while OFDM can mitigate the detrimental eﬀects due to
multipath fading [141].
Similarly to the case of SISO OFDM systems, the transmitter here duplicates the same
processing to generate the OFDM signal for each transmit antenna as described in section
2.2.3. The blocks si
l of Nu complex data samples, which are drawn uniformly from QAM or
PSK constellations, are used to modulate the Nu orthogonal sub-carriers during the lth OFDM
symbol in the ith transmit antenna as
si
l = [si
l,0, si
l,1, . . . , si
l,Nu−1],
i = 1, 2, . . . Nt.

(7.5)
Then, a time domain CP of Ng samples is inserted at the start of each OFDM symbol of
total length Ns = Nu + Ng samples. The serial concatenated symbols are then converted to
the analogue domain, up-converted to a radio frequency centered at the carrier frequency fc,
and ﬁnally transmitted through the ith antenna. A simpliﬁed block diagram of MIMO-OFDM
systems is presented in ﬁgure 7.1, where space time encoder and decoder are inserted at the
start of the OFDM modulator and at the end of the OFDM demodulator, respectively.

At each receive antenna, a superposition of signals from all Nt transmit antennas is received

Similarly to the SISO OFDM case, studied in the previous chapters, the MIMO-OFDM
145

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
systems can also tolerate a certain amount of time errors depending on the maximum channel
delay spread.
However, to prevent ISI and ICI due to the channel impairments, the FFT
window should be bounded by the ISI-free region to insure the sub-carriers orthogonality and
thus to correctly demodulate the received signal. Spatial diversity, which is known to provide
more reliable reception, is expected to enhance the synchronization performance. To beneﬁt
from spatial diversity, we opt for coded multi-antenna conﬁguration. In particular, the space
time block coding described in the next section.
7.2
Review of Space Time Block Coding
Space-Time Coding (STC) is a transmission technique that uses multiple transmit antennas in
an optimized manner. The main goal behind using STC is to extract the total available spatial
diversity in a MIMO channel through appropriate construction of the space-time codewords
without any channel knowledge at the transmitter. The STC is originally designed for known
slow ﬂat fading channels [128,131,132]. However, its combination with the OFDM modulation
technique, which is known by its capacity to transform a frequency-selective fading channel
into parallel ﬂat-fading sub-channels, allows its application in broadband wireless systems over
frequency-selective channels [134]. Among the existing STC schemes, we here present only
STBC schemes which we will later exploit to enhance the synchronization performance. In
particular, we recall the famous Alamouti STBC [131] for coherent detection and the Diﬀer-
ential Alamouti STBC [142] for non-coherent detection.
7.2.1
Alamouti STBC
Alamouti devised a remarkable STBC scheme for transmission with two transmit antennas and
Nr receive antennas in [131]. This scheme supports ML detection based on linear processing
at the receiver. Let s1 and s2 be the two symbols to be transmitted during two successive time
intervals. According to Alamouti's scheme, the following data matrix is transmitted through
the two transmit antennas during two consecutive time intervals (columns):
St =

s1
−s∗



(7.7)
146

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
where s1 and s2 are sent respectively from transmit antennas one and two at time t, and −s∗
2
and s∗
1 are sent respectively from antennas one and two at time t + 1. It is assumed that
the MIMO channel remains constant over the transmission period of St. We here consider
the example of two-branch transmit diversity with one receiver. At time t, the channel can
be modeled by complex multiplicative distortion components h1 and h2 for the ﬁrst and the
second transmit antennas, respectively. The received signals can then be expressed as
r1 = rt = h1s1 + h2s2 + η1,
r2 = rt+1 = −h1s∗
2 + h2s∗
1 + η2,
(7.8)
where r1 and r2 refer to the signals received at time t and t + 1 and η1 and η2 are the complex
random variables representing receiver noise and interference. A combining scheme is then
applied to generate the following two signals as
ˆs1 = h∗
1r1 + h2r∗
2 = (|h1|2 + |h2|2)s1 + h∗
1η1 + h2η∗
2,
ˆs2 = h∗
2r1 −h1r∗
2 = (|h1|2 + |h2|2)s2 −h1η∗
2 + h∗
2η1.
(7.9)
These combined signals are then sent to a ML detector which, for each of the signals ˆs1 and
ˆs2, choose si respecting the following decision rule
(|h1|2 + |h2|2 −1)|si|2 + d2(ˆsl, si) ≤(|h1|2 + |h2|2 −1)|sk|2 + d2(ˆsl, sk)
∀i ̸= k,
l = {1, 2},
(7.10)
where d2(x, y) is the squared Euclidean distance between signals x and y calculated as d2(x, y) =
(x −y)(x∗−y∗). In the case of PSK modulation, the decision rule in (7.10) reduces to
d2(ˆsl, si) ≤d2(ˆsl, sk).
(7.11)
The Alamouti code was the ﬁrst Orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) proposed.
Later, many
schemes have generalized it to higher number of transmit antennas as the work in [128]. This
scheme retains the simple ML decoding algorithm of Alamouti, based on only linear processing
at the receiver.
STBC schemes are used to provide diversity along both time and space dimensions, which
provide more reliable reception. However, the coherent detection of STBC requires perfect
channel state information knowledge at the receiver, which requires channel estimation. Fur-
thermore, coherent detection is suitable only for slow fading channels that remain constant for
147

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
many symbol durations. Moreover, for low and medium SNR values, the channel estimates are
very poor when it is going to be used by the receiver. To overcome this diﬃculty Diﬀerential
STBC (D-STBC) may be used.
7.2.2
Diﬀerential Alamouti STBC
Diﬀerential coding introduces memory in the transmitted data that can be utilized at the
receiver to recover the transmitted data without any knowledge of the channel impulse response.
This property is important for high speed wireless systems as the channel estimate becomes
poor in fast fading conditions. Hence, the diﬀerential coding is used in order to avoid the
need of channel estimation at the receiver. The diﬀerential coding for MIMO systems was ﬁrst
proposed by Tarokh et al. in [142] who suggests a diﬀerential encoding for MIMO systems
employing M-PSK constellation. This scheme is applicable to two transmit antennas and Nr
receive antennas. As shown in ﬁgure 7.2, the diﬀerentially coded elements are then transmitted
through Alamouti STB coder.
Figure 7.2: Diﬀerential Alamouti STBC block diagram.
Tarokh et al. deﬁne in [142] the following diﬀerential coding rule which is applied to the
codeword to be sent at time index 2t and involves the previous coded block as
s2t = (s2t s2t+1) = (c2t c2t+1)

s2t−2
s2t−1
−s∗
2t−1
s∗
2t−2

,
(7.12)
where ci are data symbols before encoding and si are diﬀerentially encoded data. As shown
in the block diagram of ﬁgure 7.2, once the codeword s2t is generated, the transmitter then
applies the Alamouti's STBC to the diﬀerentially coded samples as in (7.7). Hence, at time
index 2t, s2t and s2t+1 are sent from antennas one and two respectively, while −s∗
2t+1 and s∗
2t
are sent at time index 2t + 1. This process is inductively repeated until the end of the data
148

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
to be transmitted. Note that at the start of the encoding process, two samples which do not
contain useful data are used to encode the ﬁrst and the second samples and they will be lost
at the receiver during the decoding processing.
Considering a single receive antenna (MISO), the received signal corresponds to the super-
position of the transmitted signals aﬀected by the channel coeﬃcients and noise. Assuming
a constant channel over two consecutive data symbols (fading conditions can be considered
constant), the received signal over two successive symbol intervals can be written as
r = sH + η, H =

h1
h∗

(7.13)
where r = (r2t r∗
2t+1), s = (s2t s∗
2t+1), η = (η2t η∗
2t+1), η2t and η2t+1 are independent AWGN.
At the receiver, the non-coherent diﬀerential detection with low complexity is carried to
decode the source symbols (c2t c2t+1), sent from each transmit antenna, as
bc2t =

(r2t, r∗

where ⟨a.b⟩stands for the inner product of a and b. The terms N1 and N2 incorporate the

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
It was shown in [142] that the diﬀerential MIMO system works 3 dB poorer than the
coherent decoder [131] with perfect channel knowledge.
Naturally, it is expected that the
performance of this scheme degrades in frequency-selective channels. To adapt this scheme to
frequency-selective channels, two procedures were proposed in [134]. The ﬁrst one operates in
the frequency domain where it combines diﬀerential Alamouti STBC (as previously described)
with the OFDM multi-carrier technique. The second single-carrier scheme operates in the time
domain and employs transmit information by encoding over two transmission blocks over which
the channel is assumed to be quasi-static. Diﬀerential STBC was massively studied for unitary
and non-unitary constellation and for MIMO systems with higher order [143]- [146]. Combined
with the algorithm of Viterbi at the receiver, the D-STBC schemes proposed in [143] and [144]
allow to almost compensate the 3 dB penalty and to reduce it to 0.5 dB loss, respectively.
As mentioned in section 7.1.1, in MIMO systems, the spatial diversity allows to enhance
the detection reliability. As a result, it was exploited to ameliorate the receiver performance
namely, PAPR reduction [147], channel estimation [148] and synchronization [150]. The use
of STBC provides diversity along both the time and space dimensions which is an important
challenge, in our work, to improve the synchronization performance.
7.3
Synchronization in MISO-OFDM Systems
Identically to the SISO-OFDM systems, the MIMO-OFDM systems are sensitive to time and
frequency synchronization errors [57]. The same synchronization errors' eﬀect study provided in
section 2.3 remains valid in the case of MIMO conﬁguration. If not properly compensated, the
synchronization errors destroy the orthogonality between diﬀerent sub-carriers and cause ICI
and ISI which consequently cause severe degradation in the reception performance. Therefore,
accurate synchronization is crucial for reliable transmission using MIMO-OFDM scheme as in
the case of SISO-OFDM.
The time and frequency synchronization problem for MIMO-OFDM systems has been widely
investigated in the literature [149]- [154]. The ﬁrst paper which is interested in MIMO-OFDM
time synchronization, to the best of our knowledge, was proposed by Mody in [149]. It uses
a simple MIMO extension of Schmidl's synchronization algorithm [15].
Later, most of the
proposed synchronization approaches for MIMO-OFDM systems use diﬀerent preamble train-
ing sub-sequences and/or structure for each antenna [151,152]. At the receiver, a bank of Nt
150

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
bandpass ﬁlters is used to separate signals coming from diﬀerent antennas or a combining pro-
cedure is carried (Maximum Ratio Combiner (MRC), Equal Gain Combining (EGC)). Other
approaches like [153, 154] send unequal period preambles through diﬀerent antennas. At the
receiver, Nt correlators are required for the sake of the synchronization parameters of each
individual transmitter or EGC is used. In these techniques, diversity concepts have not been
suﬃciently explored for performance enhancement. The main novelties are the modiﬁcation
of the preamble structure and/or the training sub-sequence type sent through each antenna
without the application of coding schemes that are known to provide full spatial diversity.
Exploiting the space time diversity provided through the STBC, we here propose a new time
and frequency synchronization technique for MISO-OFDM systems. To avoid the channel es-
timation requirement in coherent STBC schemes, we opt for diﬀerential Alamouti STBC for
non-coherent detection [142].
7.3.1
Proposed Non-Coherent Synchronization Technique
The idea of the present work is to beneﬁt from a full spatial diversity transmission to en-
hance the synchronization performance through diﬀerential STBC which is known by its low
complexity. As explained in section 7.2, diﬀerential STBC is useful since it avoids the need
of channel estimation at the receiver end. This presents an important issue in the proposed
technique as we focus on non-coherent synchronization. In the following, we assume that the
same time and frequency errors emerge through all the propagation channels.
The proposed approach uses a preamble of two identical training sub-sequences as in [15] and
carries a treatment similar to that of the RC approach described in chapter 4. The training
sub-sequences are made identical in the time domain and the preamble is obtained by the
concatenation of these sequences. Respecting the encoding algorithms in [134,142] for MISO-
OFDM systems with dual transmit antennas, two diﬀerent diﬀerentially encoded replicas of the
initial training sub-sequence are generated, each duplicated to form the repetitive preamble
and sent through a transmit antenna. At the receiver, the repetitive structure ﬁrst allows
a coarse synchronization stage carried by autocorrelating the received signal respecting the
algorithm in [15].
Second, the decoding task must be achieved to recover the transmitted
signal respecting the scheme in [142]. Then, cross-correlation of the resulting decoded signal
with the known non-coded training sub-sequence is performed to ﬁne tune the coarse time
estimate. As a byproduct, the fractional part of the frequency oﬀset is also derived using the
151

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
same timing metric.
7.3.1.1
Coarse Stage
Coarse time acquisition consists in ﬁnding the preamble start over an approximate range of
samples. In the considered MISO-OFDM system, the repetitive structure is obtained in the
time domain and after D-STBC application.
Hence, it will be maintained in the received
signal and similarly to the SISO-OFDM case, the coarse synchronization stage is carried by
autocorrelating the received signal respecting the algorithm in [15] as
Mc(d) =
Nu/2−1
X
m=0
r∗
d+mrd+m+Nu/2.
(7.18)
The coarse time estimate is chosen as the argument that maximizes |Mc| and is denoted by ˆτc.
Figure 7.3 presents the coarse metric in equation (7.18) for the system parameters used in the
SISO case (Nu = 1024 and Ng = 102). As shown in the ﬁgure, the coarse metric exhibits a
plateau whose length is equal to that of the CP minus the channel memory. This leads to an
uncertainty in the preamble start detection, especially in noisy environments, which requires
a second ﬁne stage.
Once the coarse preamble start position is detected, ﬁne time synchronization should be
performed to determine the exact starting position of the preamble. The ﬁne metric, which is
based on cross-correlation, is carried over a short interval centered on the coarse time estimate.
7.3.1.2
Fine Stage
Fine time synchronization aims to detect the exact preamble start position around the coarse
time estimate. We note that at the receiver end, signals from diﬀerent transmit antennas are
superimposed together, and the time estimation algorithm may not work as expected for this
stage. Hence the diﬀerential decoding must be ﬁrst achieved to recover the transmitted signal.
Once again we refer to the scheme proposed in [142], which is recalled in section 7.2.2, for
the reverse decoding treatment. Then, we perform a cross-correlation between the decoded
received signal which we denote by ˆr, whose elements are decoded respecting equations (7.14)
and (7.15), with the known initial preamble before D-STBC application. The ﬁne metric is
152

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
given by
Mf(d) =
Nu−1
X
m=2
p∗
mˆrd+m+Nu,
(7.19)
where pm stands for the mth sample of the preamble. Here, the metric Mf is calculated over a
short interval centered on ˆτc, which allows to reduce the computational complexity of the cross-
correlation operations carried during the second stage. The ﬁne preamble start estimate ˆτf is
chosen as the argument that maximizes the metric amplitude |Mf|. It is worth to note that
the correlation outputs in the ﬁne metric (7.19) are summed over a window of length Nu −2
because the two ﬁrst samples of the received signal can not be recovered in the case of D-STBC
as they are used to estimate the following samples [142]. As the preamble is suﬃciently long
(Nu = 1024), this will not have an impact on the detection accuracy.
Figure 7.3: Coarse and ﬁne timing metric in MISO-OFDM system under noiseless conditions.
It is shown in ﬁgure 7.3 that the ﬁne metric provides extremely high sharp peak compared to
the coarse metric, which exhibits a plateau. This peak coincides with the start of the preamble
useful part, thus leading to accurate detection.
153

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
7.3.1.3
Fractional Frequency Oﬀset Estimation
The FFO estimation is here based on the initial algorithm of Schmidl and Cox [15], which is
deduced from the timing metric phase at the preamble start estimate. We recall that the FO
causes a shift of the information signal leading to a phase rotation. It then follows that all
the terms in the sum of equation (7.18), or in equation (7.19), have a constant phase if the
two identical symbol parts are correlated. Hence, we can estimate the FFO by determining
the actual phase of either the coarse timing metric Mc, at time instant ˆτc, or the ﬁne timing
metric Mf, at time instant ˆτf, as
ˆν = 1
π∠M(ˆτ).
(7.20)
As the estimation range of the phase is limited to [−π, π], the FO estimation range is limited
as well to its fractional part only.
7.3.2
Performance Evaluation of the Proposed Synchronization Technique
We use Matlab simulations to evaluate the proposed estimator's performance, showing the
Correct Detection Rate (CDR) of the preamble start, the time estimation variance and the
MSE of the fractional FO estimate. Simulations are carried out for diﬀerent SNR values and
based on the Rayleigh-fading 2×1 MISO channel model. The system uses Nu = 1024 sub-
carriers and a CP of length Ng = 102 samples. The normalized FFO is set to 0.7 sub-carrier
spacing. We use QPSK modulation and 104 Monte Carlo trials are run for each SNR value for
which 104 independent Rayleigh channel realizations are performed.
To assess the impact of the spacial diversity provided by the D-STBC, the proposed syn-
chronization technique is evaluated under three conﬁgurations: the SISO-OFDM conﬁguration,
the MISO Alamouti STB coded [131] conﬁguration, assuming perfect channel knowledge, and
the main proposed diﬀerential Alamouti STB coded conﬁguration. It is important to men-
tion that the second conﬁguration (coherent Alamouti), in which we assume perfect channel
knowledge, is assessed to evaluate the degradation occasioned by the diﬀerential coding on the
synchronization performance. This framework has the best synchronization performance that
can be provided through STBC. However, it can not be applied in practical system as the
channel estimation is required at the receiver end, which results in a degradation due to chan-
nel estimation errors. We also consider the synchronization algorithm proposed by Schellmann
154

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
et al. in [150] as a benchmark for a MISO conﬁguration.
Figure 7.4 shows the preamble start CDR of the proposed synchronization technique under
the considered conﬁgurations. As expected, it is obvious that the synchronization becomes
signiﬁcantly more robust if spatial diversity is exploited. The CDR provided in MISO con-
ﬁgurations exhibits a minimum gain of about 3 dB compared to the SISO conﬁguration, for
SNR values lower than 10 dB. In particular, for a target CDR equal to 90%, we record gains
of about 8 dB and 6 dB achieved through MISO conﬁgurations with coherent and diﬀerential
detections respectively. We also note that, for SNR values lower than 5 dB, using the D-STBC
scheme the proposed synchronization technique works 2 dB lower than the use of coherent
STBC scheme.
Yet, in a practical case, the latter scheme requires the channel estimation
which is expected to induce errors degrading the synchronization performance. The proposed
synchronization framework, that uses D-STBC, provides satisfactory detection accuracy which
becomes perfect (CDR=100%) from SNR value equal to 5 dB. We also note that Schellmann's
method provides close performance to the proposed one for SNR values lower than -2 dB with
a 1 dB loss that rises for higher SNR values. The stagnation of the CDR exhibited in this
method is expected as it is based on the SC algorithm whose metric presents a plateau.
Figure 7.4: Preamble start CDR in the Rayleigh fading channel for MISO-OFDM system.
The preamble start estimation variance is depicted in ﬁgure 7.5, where similar observations
to the case of CDR evaluation can be concluded. Obviously, the coherent Alamouti coded
155

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
estimator (under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge) oﬀers the best synchronization
performance in terms of low estimation variance that vanishes at SNR value equal to 14 dB.
Throughout the considered SNR range, the diﬀerential coded proposed estimator achieves a
minimum gain of 5 dB, compared to the single antenna case, and its estimation variance van-
ishes at SNR value equal to 16 dB. It is worth to note that Schellmann's estimator guaranteed
that the preamble start estimate falls within the metric plateau, yet the detection accuracy in
terms of CDR remains more or less poor.
Figure 7.5: Preamble start estimation variance in the Rayleigh fading channel for MISO-OFDM
system.
Figure 7.6 presents the mean squared error of the FFO estimate. We note that, unlike the
time estimation performance, both coherent and diﬀerential estimators provide almost equal
performance for the FFO estimation, here deduced from the coarse timing metric. This is
unexceptional as the estimation is carried directly on the received signal before the decoding.
Schellmann's estimator provides the same accuracy with a slight gain of about 1 dB recorded for
SNR values around -10 dB and 10 dB. Evidently, the MISO considered scenarios outperform
the single antenna case.
Indeed, for the whole considered SNR range, both coherent and
diﬀerential coding schemes provide a minimum gain of about 5 dB, which becomes higher as
the SNR rises. For example, at an error equal to 10−4 squared sub-carrier spacing, the use
of two transmit antennas provides a gain higher than 10 dB with respect to the case of single
transmit antenna.

Figure 7.6: MSE of the FFO estimate in the Rayleigh fading channel for MISO-OFDM system.
It shall be noted that, overall, the proposed synchronization technique for D-STBC MISO
conﬁguration provides satisfactory detection accuracy. Furthermore, the main advantage is
that no channel estimation is required to decode the received signal. Moreover, the provided
detection performance are more or less close to those provided by the coherent STBC, in which
the channel is assumed to be perfectly known that is not the case in practical implementation.
Conclusions
In this chapter, a new technique for non-coherent time and frequency synchronization for
MISO-OFDM systems exploiting diﬀerential STBC was presented. The proposed scheme is
based on detecting the preamble composed of two identical parts as in the chapter 4, for the
case of SISO-OFDM systems.
Two diﬀerent replicas of the same preamble as well as the
data symbols are sent through each transmit antenna. To beneﬁt from a full spatial diversity
transmission and as neither the transmitter nor the receiver has knowledge of the channel state,
D-STBC scheme [142] was applied to generate the dual transmitted signal. The synchronization
processing proceeds in two stages. First, exploiting the preamble repetitive structure, a coarse
preamble start estimate is achieved respecting Schmidl and Cox algorithm [15].
Secondly,
a non-coherent recovery of the transmitted signal, respecting the same D-STBC decoding,
157

Chapter 7. Synchronization in STBC MISO-OFDM Systems
should be achieved before proceeding the second stage. Then, a cross-correlation of the received
diﬀerentially decoded signal is carried with the known preamble to ﬁne tune the coarse preamble
start estimate. The fractional frequency oﬀset was also estimated through the coarse timing
metric.
Using Monte Carlo simulations, it was conﬁrmed that the proposed synchronization tech-
nique is eﬃcient and robust in Rayleigh fading channels even at low SNR values. The same
timing metric was evaluated in the case of SISO and MISO conﬁgurations to assess the ef-
fect of spatial diversity on synchronization performance. The comparison shed light on the
performance improvement provided by the full available spatial diversity, in the considered
2×1 MISO conﬁguration, under unknown channel. For the case of MISO-OFDM systems, the
coherent STBC scheme was also considered, under the assumption of perfect channel knowl-
edge, to assess the degradation occasioned in the proposed diﬀerential coded synchronization
framework.

8.1
Conclusions
Sensitivity to time and frequency synchronization errors is a major drawback in OFDM sys-
tems. In this thesis, we proposed reduced-complexity synchronization techniques that provide
accurate estimation of the synchronization oﬀsets with reasonable computational load. We
started by describing the wireless channel model shedding light on the suitableness of the
OFDM technique for such propagation environment, discussing the eﬀects of synchronization
errors on OFDM signal, classiﬁcation of synchronization techniques into data-aided and non-
data-aided categories, and reviewing some conventional synchronization algorithms for OFDM
systems. Most of the non-data-aided techniques in the literature are not totally blind in the
sense that some information might be required to assist the synchronization, such as chan-
nel statistical information or SNR. In addition, the performance of most blind techniques is
severely deteriorated in frequency-selective fading channels resulting in poor synchronization
performance. On the contrary, data-aided techniques are well known by their robustness in
such propagation environments. The focus was then on investigating data-aided time syn-
chronization techniques with low overhead and high detection accuracy, which can be used in
practical OFDM systems. The recovery of the fractional part of the frequency oﬀset was also
considered.
To achieve accurate synchronization with low computational load, we developed a reduced-
complexity technique for time and frequency synchronization, using a single-symbol preamble
159

Chapter 8. Conclusions and Future Work
made of two identical parts. The estimation was performed in two stages. The ﬁrst stage uses
a sliding correlation with a delay equal to half the preamble length, respecting the famous algo-
rithm of Schmidl and Cox, to provide a rough coarse time estimation. The second stage is based
on a diﬀerential correlation with a delay diﬀerent from half the preamble length, yielding a
metric with high sharp peak. The second stage is carried over a limited range around the coarse
time estimate. The combined use of sliding correlation characterized by its low computational
load and diﬀerential correlation characterized by its high computational load, yet carried over
a short interval around the coarse estimate, results in an overall reduced-complexity approach.
Furthermore, the training symbol structure was exploited in a single-stage brute-force method
where diﬀerential correlation is exclusively used, which oﬀered a slightly more accurate de-
tection than the two-stage approach at the expense of an important additional computational
burden. Simulation results carried over both AWGN and multipath channels showed the ro-
bustness of the proposed techniques which outperform the considered benchmarks for time and
frequency synchronization. To ensure the eﬃciency of the proposed techniques, we provided
a theoretical performance analysis of the brute-force approach, which is also valid for the ﬁne
stage of the reduced-complexity approach assuming perfect coarse synchronization. Exploit-
ing the central limit theorem, the metric was approximated by a Gaussian distribution and
the preamble start probability of correct detection was derived in its closed form expression.
Numerical results showed an almost perfect match between the analytical probability and the
experimental rate of correct detection, thus validating the analytical performance study for
both AWGN and multipath channels. This study was also performed for the discrete multi-
tone modulation, wherein the Gaussian distribution approximation is rougher, yet the provided
theoretical probability was very close to the experimental rate.
The proposed synchronization techniques are well suited for practical communication sys-
tems. Among them, the standard IEEE 802.11 which provides multiple repetitive training
symbols dedicated for synchronization purpose. Indeed, the repetitive preamble structure of
the IEEE 802.11 systems allowed a ﬂexible synchronization processing respecting the reduced-
complexity and the brute-force proposed approaches, which require a two identical part pream-
ble. Simulation results proved the robustness of the proposed techniques in both AWGN and
multipath channels and showed an enhancement in the time synchronization performance com-
pared to some of the existing approaches.
For performance optimization, we studied two issues related to the preamble training sub-
sequence choice. The ﬁrst issue concerned the choice of the preamble training sub-sequence,
160

Chapter 8. Conclusions and Future Work
deﬁned in the time domain, and the length of the uncertainty interval. In particular, diﬀerent
sequence types and lengths were assessed in the training sub-sequences. The study showed
that it is possible to enhance the detection accuracy using the same computational load and
the same overhead by a judicious choice of the preamble training sub-sequence type. Conse-
quently, a reduction in the computational complexity was possible keeping the same accuracy.
The second issue concerned the choice of the correlation sequence, for the training sub-sequence
deﬁned in the frequency domain. To further reduce the computational load of the synchro-
nization task, the idea was to replace the diﬀerential correlation operations, carried during
the ﬁne synchronization process, by simple sign changes. To this aim, we had to derive the
best sub-optimal correlation sequence, in terms of providing near optimal correlation sequence
performance, from a ﬁnite QPSK alphabet (±1 ± j). Three search schemes were proposed to
ﬁnd the sub-optimal sequence, namely the deterministic design algorithm, the iterative design
algorithm and the genetic algorithm. The sequences generated from both deterministic and
iterative search methods provided almost the same performance, which is globally of about
2 dB lower than the optimal performance obtained using the original (non QPSK) sequence.
However, much lower performance degradation (0.2 dB) was recorded using the sub-optimal
sequence generated through the genetic algorithm based method.
In addition to the wireless local area networks, we focused on synchronization in cellular net-
works and precisely on primary synchronization in the LTE downlink. Primary synchronization
consists in detecting the primary synchronization signal, which is composed of a Zadoﬀ-Chu
sequence, and the sector identiﬁer heavily related to that sequence. Two diﬀerential correlation
based techniques were proposed. Namely, the simply-diﬀerential technique, which proceeds in
a single stage and has the particularity of jointly achieving the time synchronization and the
sector search, and the doubly-diﬀerential technique, having a synchronization policy slightly
similar to the conventional ones by proceeding into two stages. During the ﬁrst stage, a coarse
time synchronization was achieved to localize the Zadoﬀ-Chu sequence within the received sig-
nal. The second stage is dedicated to the ﬁne time synchronization and sector search through
cross-correlating of the received signal with the known local Zadoﬀ-Chu sequence candidates.
Simulation results, investigated in the Extended Pedestrian A and Extended Typical Urban
channel models, showed the robustness of the proposed techniques. The doubly-diﬀerential ap-
proach realized a slight enhancement in the detection accuracy compared to the best considered
benchmark with comparable computational load. The simply-diﬀerential approach provided
the best trade-oﬀbetween detection accuracy and computational load, when compared to the
161

Chapter 8. Conclusions and Future Work
benchmarks and to the doubly-diﬀerential approach.
Time and fractional frequency oﬀset estimation was also investigated in the MISO-OFDM
systems, employing space-time block coding (STBC) in the last part of the thesis. Like the
previous synchronization approaches, we considered non-coherent detection and time domain
based synchronization processing. The diﬀerential STBC was applied to avoid the recourse for
any channel estimation, typically required in conventional coherent STBC. The synchroniza-
tion processing is carried in two stages wherein the ﬁrst one the received signal is continuously
is autocorrelated to detect the preamble of two identical parts. The second stage starts by
decoding the received signal respecting the diﬀerential STBC scheme. Then, cross-correlation
with the known preamble is calculated over a short interval to ﬁne tune the coarse time es-
timate. The same metric was also exploited to estimate the fractional part of the frequency
oﬀset. The evaluation of the proposed synchronization technique relevance was carried in three
diﬀerent conﬁgurations: coherent Alamouti, diﬀerential Alamouti and SISO-OFDM cases. The
comparison of these conﬁgurations showed the improvement realized through spatial diversity,
especially at low SNR value when compared to SISO conﬁguration. Furthermore, we showed
that the use of diﬀerential STBC leads to a loss of 2 dB when compared to the Alamouti
coherent scheme. It is worth to note that this latter was considered to compare the proposed
diﬀerential STBC based synchronization framework to the best performance reached by the
coherent STBC scheme, under the assumption of perfect channel knowledge.

Future Work
This thesis covered several aspects in synchronization for OFDM systems. Yet there are still
many remaining and emerging synchronization problems in practical OFDM systems that have
not been addressed.
In the ﬁrst hand, we can envisage the extension to MIMO-OFDM systems by applying the
diﬀerential STBC based synchronization scheme studied for a 2×1 MISO-OFDM conﬁguration
to an n×1 MISO conﬁguration exploiting other coding schemes. The more generalized MIMO
conﬁguration can also be treated [45], [46]. Furthermore, an optimal training sequence design,
in which a pair of Golay sequences of speciﬁc properties is sent through each antenna, can be
envisaged to enhance the synchronization performance for both conﬁgurations. Moreover, the
simply-diﬀerential reduced-complexity approach that was developed for a repetitive preamble

Chapter 8. Conclusions and Future Work
structure should be evaluated in the MIMO WLAN systems. In particular, the IEEE 802.11n
standard is challenging in synchronization, since it exploits cyclic delay diversity that causes
pseudo multipath. By choosing a correlation shift equal to the cyclic delay shift, we expect to
avoid the pseudo multipath problem.
In the other hand, to provide a complete insight in synchronization for OFDM systems,
we can append the recovery of the integer part of the frequency oﬀset, exploiting the same
preamble or a modiﬁed version of it.
The synchronization problem considered here is for point-to-point systems. A trivial ex-
tension is to study similar problems in OFDMA multiple access communication schemes with
more than one user.
Finally, it is worth to study how to adapt the synchronization scheme to deal with the case
of uplink LTE where single carrier OFDM is adopted [47].
