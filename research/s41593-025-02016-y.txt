Hippocampal spiking sequences encode and link behaviorally relevant 
information across time. How inhibition sculpts these sequences remains 
unclear. We performed longitudinal voltage imaging of CA1 parvalbumin- 
and somatostatin-expressing interneurons in mice performing an 
odor-cued working memory task. Unlike pyramidal odor-specific sequences 
that encode odor and time throughout a delay period, interneurons 
encoded odor delivery, but not odor identity or delay time. Odor-triggered 
inhibition was exerted by stable numbers of interneurons across days, 
with constant cell turnover, independent of task training. At odor onset, 
brief spiking of parvalbumin interneurons was followed by widespread 
hyperpolarization and synchronized theta-paced rebound spiking across 
interneurons. Electrophysiology, optogenetics and calcium imaging 
corroborated that parvalbumin interneurons silenced most pyramidal cells 
during odor delivery, whereas somatostatin interneurons suppressed other 
interneurons. The few odor-selective pyramidal cells spiked together with 
interneuronal p­os­t-­hy­pe­rp­ol­ar­ization r­eb­ou­nd. Collectively, inhibition 
increases the signal-to-noise ratio of pyramidal cue representations, 
enabling efficient encoding of memory-relevant information.
The hippocampus is critical for transforming a sequence of experi-
ences into memories, while also keeping track of their temporal rela-
tionships1. Sequentially activated ensembles of pyramidal cells are 
thought to underlie this function1,2. Some hippocampal pyramidal 
cells respond to memory-relevant sensory cues ('cue cells'), generat-
ing sensory representations3-6. Other pyramidal cells ('time cells'), fire 
in succession after the cue, encoding its memory as well as the time 
elapsed since its presentation5,7-10. Spiking sequences of cue cells fol-
lowed by cue-specific time cells, provide a neural mechanism for linking 
contiguous experiences across gaps in time into a memory trace2,11,12.
Population activity patterns, including such spiking sequences, 
require the close coordination between excitation and inhibition in 
neuronal networks13. Yet, the role of inhibitory neurons in sculpting 
memory-encoding hippocampal dynamics is unclear. Inhibition in the 
hippocampus is regulated by a diverse array of GABAergic interneu-
rons, divided into subtypes with distinct anatomical organization, con-
nectivity, firing patterns and genetic profiles14,15. Two major subtypes 
are parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SST) 
interneurons, which mostly target perisomatic areas and dendrites of 
pyramidal cells, respectively. Perisomatic PV inhibition controls the 
timing of pyramidal output16 and coordinates rhythmic population 
activity17-19. Dendritic SST inhibition gates the integration of proximal 
and distal dendritic inputs on pyramidal cells20 and ultimately their gain 
(their output relative to their input)21. The interplay between pyramidal 
cells, PV and SST interneurons shapes hippocampal spiking in vivo and 
controls behavior (reviewed elsewhere22-25); however, this interplay has

and 100.1 ± 27.4 mW mm−2) for PV and SST recordings, respectively 
(n = 104 PV, 140 SST recordings. P = 1.6 × 10−5; two-sided t-test). The 
field of view (FOV) was set to 88 × 44 µm (64 × 32 pixels), which allowed 
for image acquisition at 1,000 frames per second, and in most cases 
encompassed a single cell. Recordings captured action potentials 
and subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations (Fig. 1c-f). We 
were able to record activity across multiple trials (up to 48 from a 
single cell), before clear spike waveforms and subthreshold dynamics  
were attenuated due to GEVI photobleaching (Fig. 1g,h). Overall, we 
recorded 107 PV cells and 93 SST cells (21.4 ± 9.1 and 18.6 ± 12.6 per 
mouse) in 104 and 90 recordings, respectively, over 16.2 ± 6.5 trials per 
PV cell and 14.7 ± 8.5 trials per SST cell. In naive sessions, 15.4 ± 6.8 trials 
and 14.4 ± 7.4 trials were recorded per PV and SST cell, respectively, in 
31 and 35 videos. In trained sessions, 16.5 ± 6.5 and 14.9 ± 9.2 trials were 
recorded in 73 and 55 videos, respectively. Recordings were processed 
using the Volpy automated pipeline in Python30.
At higher signal-to-noise ratios, optically reported action poten-
tials of PV interneurons were higher in amplitude and wider in duration 
than those of SST interneurons, and an after-hyperpolarization was 
often recorded in both cell groups (Extended Data Fig. 1). PV interneu-
rons exhibited lower interspike intervals than SST interneurons (Fig. 1i), 
yielding higher average firing rates and burst index (Fig. 1j,k)16. The 
higher firing rates in PV interneurons were observed in immobility 
segments, including immobility during reward delivery, but not during 
locomotion on the treadmill (Extended Data Fig. 1).
Locomotion was higher during odors in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 1). Average firing rates were higher during locomo-
tion in both PV and SST interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 1), even when 
excluding odor segments; however, correlations between firing rates 
and locomotion ('speed scores'; Methods) remained low, with 79.4% PV 
and 85% SST cells having below-chance speed scores (Fig. 1l).
In both PV and SST interneurons, ΔF/F traces and spiking often 
exhibited pronounced theta rhythmicity (Fig. 1m). This was reflected 
in 4-10 Hz peaks in the average power spectra of ΔF/F, after action 
potential removal (de-spiking; Methods), during motion and immobil-
ity segments (Fig. 1n). Intracellular theta amplitudes were higher for 
PV than SST interneurons on average (Fig. 1o). Spiking was strongly 
phase-locked to intracellular theta peaks, similarly for PV and SST 
interneurons (Fig. 1p-q). During odor presentation, intracellular theta 
increased in both PV and SST interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 1). 
During locomotion, intracellular theta increased in PV but not SST 
interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 1), suggesting that SST theta may be 
more strongly driven by odors than locomotion.
Collectively, in vivo fast-rate voltage imaging, with the ASAP3 GEVI, 
reliably captured spiking and membrane potential dynamics of PV and 
SST interneurons during the DNMS task and revealed an association 
between the intracellular theta oscillations in these interneurons with 
odor presentation.
PV-SST cells encode odor delivery not odor identity  
or delay time
During the DNMS task, CA1 pyramidal cells form spiking sequences 
comprising 'odor cells' that spike during a specific odor, followed by 
'time cells', each spiking at a particular time point in the delay after a spe-
cific odor5. We asked whether interneurons form similar odor-specific 
spiking sequences.
As pyramidal sequences can also be observed in untrained mice, 
we pooled data from all sessions, including naive exposure to DNMS 
trials. Analysis hereafter focuses on the period covering the first odor 
presentation and the ensuing delay in each trial ('odor-delay interval'). 
Interneurons fired mostly continuously, but many cells increased their 
firing during odor presentation (Fig. 2a,d). Many interneurons exhib-
ited significant temporal tuning ('firing fields'; Methods) during the 
odor presentation but independently of the odor identity (Fig. 2b,e). 
Unlike pyramidal cells5, few interneurons had odor-specific fields 
rarely been studied outside of spatial navigation. As a result, the role of 
PV and SST neurons in sculpting memory-encoding spiking sequences, 
combining cue cells and time cells, remains unknown.
Exploring the role of inhibition in memory processes requires 
monitoring activity from identified interneuron subtypes with high 
temporal resolution, to reliably record changes in their high firing 
rates. It also requires tracking the same cells across memory-relevant 
timescales of multiple days. Electrophysiology does not allow com-
bined cell-type specificity and multiday cell tracking, whereas calcium 
imaging cannot capture the fast-spiking dynamics of interneurons. 
Moreover, neither calcium imaging nor extracellular electrophysi-
ology captures subthreshold membrane potentials which contain 
valuable information on synaptic inputs. Fast frame-rate voltage imag-
ing of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs)26,27 overcomes 
these barriers and captures action potentials as well as subthreshold 
membrane potentials. It also allows imaging of the same cells for 
multiple days28.
We employed kHz-rate voltage imaging to investigate the spik-
ing and membrane potential dynamics of PV and SST hippocampal 
interneurons during an odor-cued working memory task. We have 
previously described pyramidal sequences in this task, composed of 
'odor cells', encoding specific odor cues, followed by odor-specific 
time cells throughout an ensuing delay period, encoding the pre-
ceding cue as well as delay time5. Here we found that CA1 PV and SST 
interneurons are synchronously activated by the odor delivery, but 
not in an odor-selective manner and irrespective of task engagement 
by the mouse. By supplementing our voltage imaging with optoge-
netic manipulations during electrophysiological recordings, as well as 
two-photon calcium imaging, we demonstrate that odor-timed inhibi-
tion increases the signal-to-noise ratio of pyramidal odor cells, allowing 
for efficient encoding of cue information during memory activation.
Results
In vivo voltage imaging of PV and SST cells during DNMS
To capture fast-scale spiking and membrane potential dynamics of 
interneurons, we expressed the GEVI ASAP3 in hippocampal PV or 
SST interneurons. Adult PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice (n = 5 mice in each 
group) were virally transfected in right dorsal CA1 with Cre-dependent 
'ASAP3' (AAV8-ef1α -DiO-ASAP3-Kv)28 and implanted with an imag-
ing window above CA1 and a metal headbar for head fixation (Fig. 1a). 
Mice were later water-deprived and trained on an olfactory delayed 
non-match-to-sample (DNMS) working memory task, while head-fixed 
on a treadmill (Fig. 1a)5,29. Each trial consisted of two odor cues of 1 s 
each, with a 5-s delay between them. Mice were trained to lick a lickport 
to release water rewards only if the two odors did not match, and refrain 
from licking if they matched (Fig. 1b). Odor cues were either isoamyl 
acetate ('odor A') or pinene ('odor B') and were delivered in random 
combinations. Licking in odor-match trials was not punished, but no 
reward was delivered. Performance was quantified as the percentage 
of correct hits and rejections. We have previously shown that, after a 
shaping period, mice learn to perform DNMS within ~5-6 days, using 
working memory5.
We first conducted voltage imaging of PV or SST interneurons 
for two imaging sessions (separate days) while mice were naive to the 
task and passively smelled the odor cues. We then trained mice on the 
DNMS task (~10-14 days total) and resumed voltage imaging after they 
were well trained (Methods). In trained imaging sessions, PV-Cre mice 
reached a higher performance than SST-Cre mice (71.9 ± 1.9% versus 
62.1 ± 1.8% per recording (mean ± s.d.), respectively. P = 3.51 × 10−4, 
two-sided t-test, n = 104 PV, 84 SST recordings), though the same train-
ing protocol was used throughout. Note that, unless otherwise stated, 
ensuing findings are independent of performance levels. Imaging 
took place with a custom-made epifluorescence microscope. The 
power of the excitation LED was set lower for SST cells, which lie mostly  
in stratum oriens and were thus closer to the coverslip (119.9 ± 42.7

(Fig. 2c,f), yielding sparse odor-specific sequences when pooled 
across mice and sessions (11 PV and 8 SST cells were odor A-specific; 
10.3% and 8.6% of all cells in each group. Eleven PV and 7 SST cells were 
odor B-specific (10.3% and 7.5%, respectively; Fig. 2g). In contrast, 
non-odor-specific fields were found in 36 PV and 30 SST cells (33.6% 
and 33.2% of all cells in each group; Fig. 2h). PV and SST cells had similar 
percentage of detected fields per session and ratios of odor A-specific, 
odor B-specific and non-odor-specific fields (Fig. 2i). Average odor 
selectivity was also similar between PV and SST cells and was slightly 
but significantly above chance for both groups (Fig. 2j). In total, 54.2% 
of all PV cells and 48.4% of SST cells had a significant field within the 
odor-delay interval ('field cells'), whereas 45.8% and 51.6% cells showed 
no significant fields ('no-field cells'). Firing rates of PV and SST field 
cells were higher during odors than delay period or response window 
and increased similarly for the first and second odor in a trial (Fig. 2k). 
During delay, PV rates returned to baseline, whereas SST ones remained 
higher (Fig. 2k).
Most fields were observed during odor delivery ('odor fields'; 
Fig. 2h). Firing rates were rarely tuned to delay time points, resulting 
in very sparse 'delay fields' (Fig. 2l; 9.3% PV and 12.9% SST cells had 
delay fields. 50% and 58.3% of those were within 1 s from odor offset). 
Odor fields, but not delay fields, coincided with a depolarized ΔF/F, 
whereas during odors both field types yielded similar subthreshold 
traces (Extended Data Fig. 2).
PV field cells had similar average firing rates but a larger soma and 
stronger correlation with locomotion than no-field PV cells, suggesting 
that they may represent distinct PV subtypes. PV field cells also spiked 
at an earlier intracellular theta phase but had similar theta power and 
theta spiking modulation with no-field ones. In contrast, SST field cells 
showed no differences with no-field cells in these metrics, except for 
stronger intracellular theta (Extended Data Fig. 2).
We tested whether odor fields were triggered by locomotion, 
which was higher during odors. Odor-field cells had similar firing rates 
in trials when the mouse was immobile versus locomoting during odor 
delivery (Extended Data Fig. 2). Furthermore, odor-field spiking was 
more correlated with odor delivery than locomotion (Fig. 2m), with 
55.1% and 58.1% of PV and SST cells having significant odor scores (simi-
larly to speed scores; Methods), compared to 20.6% and 15% for speed 
scores, respectively. Therefore, spiking was more strongly correlated 
with odor delivery than locomotion.
Furthermore, odor fields were not triggered by clicking of the 
odor air valve. In some recordings, the odor airflow was turned off on 
alternate trials while all valves remained operational. PV and SST spik-
ing was reduced during odor OFF trials, often throughout the delay 
interval. Average PV and SST firing rates were significantly lower dur-
ing OFF trials, whereas average locomotion was unaffected (Extended 
Data Fig. 2), supporting that odor fields are generated by odor delivery 
rather than clicking or locomotion.
To confirm most interneurons were not odor selective, we trained 
binary support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on each cell's activity 
over the first odor. As expected, SVM classifiers trained on odor-specific 
PV cells, decoded odor identity better than chance, and better than 
those trained on non-odor-specific cells or no-field cells, both of which 
performed at chance levels, as did all SST-trained classifiers, including 
those trained on odor-specific SST cells (Fig. 2n). Classifiers trained on 
the entire odor-delay interval, instead of the first odor, performed at 
chance levels (P > 0.05 one-sided WT; compared to shuffle baseline).
We also trained Bayesian decoders on each cell's firing rate to 
decode time throughout the odor-delay interval. The prevalence 
of odor fields resulted in efficient time-decoding during odors but 
chance levels during the delay period for most cell groups (Fig. 2o). 
Bayesian-based odor-decoding was at chance levels in all cases (P > 0.05 
compared to shuffle baseline for all bins).
Collectively, these findings demonstrate that, unlike odor- 
selective spiking sequences of pyramidal cells throughout the 
odor-delay interval, PV and SST interneurons encode mostly odor 
delivery, not delay time, and are not odor-selective.
Steady-state inhibition across days independent of training
Pyramidal sequences combine stable odor fields with highly dynamic 
delay fields across days which increase in number as mice learn the 
DNMS task5. We next examined whether interneuronal fields show 
similar stability and learning-related dynamics.
We tracked a subset of interneurons across multiple imaging ses-
sions (different days) to assess changes across days or between naive 
and trained states. Fifteen PV cells and 11 SST cells (from four out of five 
PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively) were recorded over at least two 
separate days. To ensure that a cell was matched to a previous record-
ing, we briefly captured an extended FOV (352 × 352 µm at < 100 Hz 
frame rate) containing features around the cell body that were used 
as reference. We recorded a cell for up to five consecutive sessions 
(Extended Data Fig. 3) while mice performed the DNMS task, as well 
as some cells before and after DNMS training (Fig. 3a,c).
Interneuron firing fields tended to remap across days. The firing 
peak of a cell could become a significant field or lose significance, shift 
along the time axis or switch between being odor-specific or nonspe-
cific, resulting in odor selectivity that fluctuated across days (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). Of note, some cells exhibited the same odor field in a naive 
and a trained session, weeks apart (Fig. 3b,d). Moreover, PV odor fields 
were often retained between a trained session X and the next session 
X + 1, whereas most PV delay fields had turned to odor fields (Fig. 3e). 
Similarly, three out of five PV odor fields, recorded in a naive session, 
were retained in the first trained session (Fig. 3f). SST fields exhibited 
higher instability overall. We quantified the turnover of odor fields 
across days by the percentages of cells in a session that retained a 
field from the previous session ('stable') or gained one ('inflow') or 
lost their field in the next session ('outflow'). There were significantly 
more stable PV odor fields than inflowing or outflowing ones. Stable 
SST fields were more rare than PV ones and did not differ from inflow 
or outflow rates (Fig. 3g).
Beyond fields, we assessed a cell's spiking similarity across any 
two sessions by computing the average correlation of its firing rates 
across all pairs of trials between the two sessions. Correlations were 
low and they did not differ across trained sessions compared to pre- 
versus post-training for either PV or SST interneurons (Fig. 3h). Moreo-
ver, there was no relationship between correlations and the distance 
between imaging sessions (Fig. 3h). These findings corroborate an 
overall random change in interneuron firing activity between days, 
which was not affected by learning the DNMS task.
We also searched for any learning-related changes in the collective 
activity of recorded cells. Unlike pyramidal delay fields that increase 
in number with learning, we found stable percentages of PV and SST 
fields across days, as well as pre- versus post-training, even though 
performance improved across trained sessions (Fig. 3i,j). Average odor 
selectivity also remained stable (Fig. 3i,j), corroborating our observa-
tion in the multiday-tracked cells. As a result, SVM odor-decoding 
accuracy from field cells across only naive sessions or only trained 
sessions, yielded similar results to the decoding accuracy across all 
sessions pooled (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Finally, locomotion on the treadmill increased post-training, but 
seemed to minimally affect interneuron firing, with SST firing rates, 
but not PV ones, showing a small increase post-training (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). In PV cells, intracellular theta power and phase locking 
of spikes increased post-training. A post-training increase in theta 
power was also observed in multiday-tracked cells when pooling PV 
and SST cells, but it remained stable across trained sessions (Extended 
Data Fig. 3).
Collectively, our findings suggest steady-state inhibition, exerted 
by a stable number of interneurons over days, with fluctuating spiking 
modulation and irrespective of participation to the DNMS task.

PV-SST hyperpolarization at odor onset resets  
intracellular theta
Little is known about subthreshold dynamics of interneurons in vivo, 
even though they contain information on behaviorally relevant synaptic 
inputs. We thus focused on the subthreshold membrane potential from 
PV and SST interneurons.
During odor onset, a prominent negative deflection in the interneu-
rons' de-spiked ΔF/F across both odor A and odor B trials, signified a 
hyperpolarization of PV and SST interneurons (Fig. 4a,c), observed 
across multiple cells and trials and followed by a depolarization 
during odor spiking (Fig. 4b,d). Similar negative deflections could be 
seen during the delay but these did not occur in a systematic manner 
(Fig. 4a,c). A significant hyperpolarization (Methods) occurred in a 
similar percentage of trials in PV and SST interneurons (22.5 ± 21.5% 
versus 21.7 ± 18.9%) and was completely absent in 22.4% PV and 19.3% 
SST cells (Fig. 4e). During hyperpolarization, average de-spiked ΔF/F 
deflections were similar between PV and SST cells (−4.8 ± 1.7 versus

SST cells (81 ± 70 ms versus 83 ± 97 ms after odor onset (due to more 
outliers in SST cells) but with medians at 68 ms versus 57 ms; Fig. 4h) 
and lasted longer (194 ± 166 ms versus 187 ± 203 ms after odor onset; 
Fig. 4i). The hyperpolarization amplitude correlated with the ensuing 
depolarization during the odor in PV cells only (Fig. 4j).
The fact that hyperpolarization was not present in every cell and 
every trial suggests that it was not artifactual. To exclude a vibration 
artifact, we detached the odor/air alternating valve (the only moving 
component) from the recording rig, but the deflection was unaffected 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). To exclude any artifactual increase in fluores-
cence (as ΔF/F is inverted for negatively tuned ASAP3), we expressed 
the positively tuned ASAP4 GEVI31 in a set of mice (n = 5 SST-Cre mice). 
Noninverted ASAP4 ΔF/F traces exhibited a decrease in fluorescence, 
equivalent to that with ASAP3. Furthermore, the hyperpolarization 
was not triggered by locomotion, as it was present irrespective of the 
mouse moving during odor onset (Extended Data Fig. 4). It was not 
triggered by odor detection either, as it was present even when odors 
were turned off, and its amplitude was similar during preferred and 
nonpreferred odors in odor-specific field cells. Its amplitude and rate 
of occurrence across trials were also similar between odor-specific, 
non-odor-specific and no-field cells (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Of note, theta-bandpassed ΔF/F traces, averaged across trials, were 
larger around the hyperpolarization (Fig. 4b,d,k). This was not due to a 
transient increase in theta power by the hyperpolarization itself. In fact, 
the deflection resulted in a transient increase in delta power, whereas 
intracellular theta increased throughout the odor delivery, not just at 
its onset (Fig. 4m-n). Instead, the increase in average theta-bandpassed 
ΔF/F at odor onset indicated a transient theta phase resetting, resulting 
in reduced theta phase variance across trials at odor onset (Fig. 4l).
Across days, the hyperpolarization amplitude in PV, but not 
SST cells, was lower in trained sessions than in naive ones (Fig. 4o), 
whereas the subsequent depolarizations were similar (P > 0.05, WT). 
Notably, in both cell groups the rate of hyperpolarization occurrence 
decreased across days and thus was lower in trained than in naive ses-
sions (Fig. 4p). These changes were not associated with DNMS perfor-
mance as occurrence rates and amplitudes were similar in correct and

error trials and uncorrelated with performance (Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Amplitudes were also uncorrelated with coincident locomotion or with 
post-hyperpolarization firing rates; however, occurrence rates were 
anticorrelated with locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 4), in accordance 
with the opposite progression of the two variables across days.
Collectively, these findings reveal a novel inhibitory input on PV 
and SST interneurons, triggered by the onset of odor delivery but dis-
sociated from odors or locomotion, that transiently resets intracellular 
theta oscillations.
Hyperpolarization is preceded by PV spiking and synchronizes 
rebound theta spiking
We next examined the spiking correlates of PV and SST interneurons 
to odor onset hyperpolarization.
PV cells often produced a single spike or short burst, immediately 
preceding a hyperpolarization (Fig. 5a), observed when pooling spikes 
across all cells and trials (Fig. 5b). In average PV firing rates with 5-ms 
binning (instead of 100 ms as before), this spiking yielded a peak at 
~25 ms after odor onset, lasting ~30 ms and coinciding with the onset 
of average hyperpolarization. Notably, this brief odor onset spiking 
was largely absent in SST cells (Fig. 5c).
Moreover, the increase in odor spiking after the hyperpolarization 
was not uniform throughout the remaining odor interval. Instead, 
post-hyperpolarization rebound spiking was briefly modulated in theta 
cycles, corresponding to the reset intracellular theta peaks (Fig. 5b). 
The rebound spiking of SST cells was relatively attenuated, though 
theta modulation was still present in field cells (Fig. 5c). As average 
theta was synchronously reset in PV and SST cells (Fig. 4k), rebound 
spiking peaks were also synchronized between PV and SST cells 
(Fig. 5b,c). Similar features were observed between odor A and odor 
B trials and across preferred and nonpreferred odors of odor-specific 
cells (though, as expected, spiking was overall higher in preferred 
odors; Extended Data Fig. 5).
Odor-onset firing rates (30-50 ms into the cue) were similar 
between field and no-field cells (Fig. 5d) but rebound rates (200-
500 ms) were higher in field cells compared to no-field cells (Fig. 5e). 
Even though PV cells fired more than SST during odor onset, the sub-
sequent rebound firing increase was comparable between the two cell 
types (Fig. 5f).
Finally, PV odor-onset spiking did not change across days or pre- 
versus post-training; however, rebound spiking of SST cells, but not PV, 
slightly increased post-training (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Our findings reveal that the onset of hyperpolarization coincides 
with a brief synchronous PV spiking, whereas its offset is followed 
by rebound spiking of PV and SST cells, transiently synchronized in 
theta cycles.
PV interneurons suppress most pyramidal cells during odors
After characterizing PV and SST interneuronal dynamics, we next 
sought to assess their effects on pyramidal activity during odor cues. 
We hypothesized that the prevalence of interneuronal odor fields 
should yield mostly inhibited pyramidal cells during the odor, rather 
than activated ones.
To test this hypothesis, PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice were virally trans-
fected, bilaterally in dorsal CA1, with the soma-targeted, Cre-dependent 
inhibitory opsin GtACR2 (ref. 32), which can efficiently silence neu-
ronal firing without rebound spiking after light offset33. They were 
also implanted daily with Neuropixel probes and optic fibers above 
CA1 (either bilaterally or unilaterally; Fig. 6a). An additional wild-type 
mouse was only implanted with a Neuropixel probe unilaterally. We 
recorded extracellular spikes and local fields potential (LFP) signals 
during DNMS trials both in naive and trained sessions. Putative pyrami-
dal and interneuronal units were clustered, based on spike waveforms 
and firing rates (Extended Data Fig. 6). Either PV or SST interneurons 
were optogenetically inhibited in randomly distributed subsets of 
trials (see below).

We first focused on pooled trials without optogenetic stimula-
tion. Putative pyramidal units exhibited odor-specific fields during 
the odor ('odor cells') or delay period ('time cells'), in accordance 
with the pyramidal sequences we have previously described5 (Fig. 6b). 
Moreover, putative interneuronal units increased spiking during the 
odor, in a non-odor-selective manner (Fig. 6c), as in our voltage imaging 
data. Of note, many pyramidal units reduced their activity or stopped 
spiking during the odor (Fig. 6b). Across pooled pyramidal units, only 
26.4% increased spiking during odors ('odor-excited'), whereas the 
remaining 73.6% had negative odor responses ('odor-inhibited', Fig. 6d), 
supporting our hypothesis that most pyramidal cells are inhibited 
during odor cues.
To test causally the role of inhibitory dynamics, observed with 
voltage imaging, on pyramidal odor responses, we optogenetically 
suppressed PV or SST interneurons, in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respec-
tively, during (1) the short window of PV spiking at odor-onset; (2) the 
hyperpolarization window; or (3) the rebound window. These stimula-
tion protocols were delivered in separate trial blocks where they were 
randomly intermixed with nonstimulation trials (Methods). Many 
putative interneurons reduced spiking during stimulation (Extended 
Data Fig. 6), whereas others increased spiking, suggesting a release 
from recurrent inhibition.
Suppressing PV cells during odor-onset or the rebound window 
produced no effect in the firing rates of odor-excited pyramidal units 
(Fig. 6e; apart from a brief suppression at light onset due to tran-
siently activated interneurons by the opsin32); however, it activated 
odor-inhibited pyramidal cells, significantly increasing their average 
odor responses (Fig. 6e). PV suppression had no significant effect on 
other interneurons.
Suppressing SST cells produced no effect in either pyrami-
dal group, except for a small, significant increase in the spiking of 
odor-inhibited cells when stimulating at odor onset (Fig. 6f); however, 
it increased activity of other interneurons, resulting in significantly 
higher interneuronal odor responses (Fig. 6f), in agreement with find-
ings that cortical SST cells inhibit other interneurons more strongly 
than PV cells do34-36.
Finally, no significant effects were observed when suppressing PV 
or SST cells during the hyperpolarization window, where their activity 
would already be minimal (Extended Data Fig. 6).
Collectively, our findings corroborate that PV-mediated inhibi-
tion effectively suppresses 'background' activity of most pyramidal 
cells during odors, allowing only a few pyramidal cells to respond to 
cues by spiking.
Inhibition coordinates odor-cell and time-cell spiking
How is the spiking of the few odor-excited pyramidal cells tempo-
rally organized, relative to the interneuronal hyperpolarization and 
rebound? One possibility is that pyramidal cells also exhibit a hyper-
polarization and they spike afterwards together with interneuronal 
rebound. Alternatively, the hyperpolarization may create a window 
for pyramidal spiking.
To address these alternatives, we first confirmed that putative 
interneuronal units exhibited a window of theta-modulated spiking, 
concurrent with the rebound window in our voltage imaging data 
(Fig. 6h). Out of the odor-excited pyramidal units, some fired during 
the hyperpolarization window without odor selectivity, whereas others 
fired mostly after the hyperpolarization with visible odor selectivity 
(Fig. 6c). As such, odor-excited pyramidal units could be split into 
two groups: those with peak activation before the rebound window 
(<200 ms from odor onset, 'early-spiking') and those with peak acti-
vation during or after it (>200 ms, 'late-spiking'). In the early-spiking 
group, activity peaked explicitly during the interneuronal hyperpolari-
zation window and quickly subsided, suggesting a brief disinhibition 
of these cells (Fig. 6h). Pyramidal excitation during the hyperpolariza-
tion window was also reflected in concurrent negative deflections in 
LFP traces (Extended Data Fig. 6). In the late-spiking group, activity 
was sparse during the hyperpolarization and increased together with 
interneuronal rebound (Fig. 6h). Therefore, inhibitory dynamics can 
split pyramidal odor responses into two subtypes.
Finally, we asked how odor and time cells relate to these pyramidal 
odor responses. Out of the pooled pyramidal units, sorted by their 
odor response (Fig. 6d), we isolated odor cells and time cells (Fig. 6g 
and Methods), collectively referred to as 'sequence cells'. As expected, 
most odor cells belonged to the odor-excited group (60.5% of odor 
cells had positive average odor responses). The rest were mainly 
early-spiking cells with significantly lower odor selectivity (Fig. 6g) 
and reduced firing after the hyperpolarization window. Notably, most 
time cells belonged to the odor-inhibited group (93.6% of time cells) as 
opposed to increasing their firing during odors (but with a lower peak 
than during their delay time field). In accordance with these findings, 
optogenetic suppression of PV or SST interneurons had no effects on 
odor cells, as these belonged to the odor-excited group and were thus 
unaffected by stimulation (P > 0.05, paired-sample t-test of average 
odor responses in all stimulation protocols). Accordingly, PV or SST 
suppression during odor onset and PV suppression during rebound 
significantly increased odor spiking of time cells (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, 
respectively) as these belonged to the odor-inhibited pyramidal group.
To ensure our observations generalize to a larger sample of 
sequence cells from the defined CA1 pyramidal layer, we analyzed 
a large dataset from two-photon calcium imaging in dorsal CA1 of 
transgenic mice (n = 11), virally transfected with GCaMP6f, during the 
DNMS task5 (Extended Data Fig. 7). A total of 12,476 identified pyramidal 
cells were pooled across 58 imaging sessions. Odor-specific pyramidal 
spiking sequences were previously observed in these recordings5. Using 
the deconvolved calcium signal as a proxy of spiking probability, we 
confirmed that (1) the majority of pyramidal cells were inhibited by the 
odor (67.3% of pyramidal cells); (2) odor cells with a field during the 
interneuronal hyperpolarization window had lower odor selectivity 
than those spiking post-hyperpolarization; and (3) most time cells had 
a negative odor response (70.8% of time cells; Extended Data Fig. 7).
These results suggest that time cells are largely inhibited during 
odor cues, whereas odor cell responses can be segmented based on 
inhibitory spiking dynamics, with odor-selective cells spiking together 
with interneuronal rebound.
Discussion
Using voltage imaging in vivo, we investigated how interneurons 
interact with hippocampal pyramidal sequences that encode and 
retain sensory or contextual information across gaps in time1,2. Unlike 
odor-specific sequences throughout cues and the ensuing delay in a 
working memory task, CA1 PV and SST interneurons encoded odor 
delivery but not odor identity or delay time. Odor-triggered inhibition 
was exerted by a stable number but different set of cells daily, irrespec-
tive of whether the animal was trained to the task or not. Transient PV 
spiking at odor onset was followed by a widespread hyperpolarization, 
which reset intracellular theta and synchronized rebound PV and SST 
spiking. Electrophysiological recordings, two-photon calcium imaging 
and optogenetic manipulations corroborated that PV interneurons 
silenced most pyramidal cells during odor cues, including time cells, 
whereas SST interneurons suppressed mostly other interneurons. 
The few odor-activated pyramidal cells spiked in coordination with 
interneurons. Our collected findings suggest that inhibition medi-
ates memory-encoding (cue presentation) rather than maintenance 
(delay period), by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of pyramidal cue 
representations. This may be crucial for efficiently encoding sensory 
information and conveying it downstream.
So far, most insights on the role of inhibition in hippocampal 
dynamics in vivo have come from navigation tasks revealing diverse 
inhibitory modalities, including spatially tuned37, untuned38 and nega-
tively tuned inhibition39,40. Whether and how interneurons mediate

nonspatial, sensory and temporal representations by pyramidal cells 
remained underexplored. Our findings combine temporally tuned 
inhibition during cues, untuned inhibition during the delay period, 
and no systematic negatively tuned fields, suggesting that inhibitory 
tuning depends on the behavioral context.
Our results indicate that interneurons regulate working memory- 
related pyramidal dynamics in a few ways. First, interneurons increase 
the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory representations by suppressing 
background through their widespread, nonselective activation, so 
that only a minority of pyramidal cells can spike in response to a cue. 
Our finding that this function is mainly performed by PV interneu-
rons agrees with the efficient suppression of action potentials by PV 
interneurons41. A similar role has been reported during navigation, 
where spatially homogeneous inhibition suppressed out-of-field exci-
tation and enhanced the selectivity of place cells within their fields38. 
In the cortex, a similar role in sharpening pyramidal stimulus selec-
tivity or spike timing has been proposed42. Of note, interneuronal 
ensembles performing this function exhibited fast cell turnover across 
days, contrasting the slow drift of odor-encoding pyramidal cells5 and 
arguing against a hard-wired class of inhibitory neurons for regulating 
hippocampal odor encoding.
Another inhibitory effect on cue representations may be the seg-
mentation of pyramidal responses into early non-odor-selective ones 
and late odor-selective ones, coinciding with theta-paced interneuronal 
rebound. This segmentation could be driven by a different degree of 
PV-mediated inhibition that CA1 pyramidal cells receive. PV interneu-
rons are known to synchronize rebound pyramidal theta spiking 
in vitro43 and in vivo17 and a similar theta resetting was observed in rat 
CA1 EEGs during odors, ~150 ms after sniffing onset4, as the timeline 
reported here. In the same study, odor-responsive pyramidal cells 
increased spiking ~300 ms after sniffing onset, like the late-spiking 
group here. Theta-organized responses can better entrain downstream 
cortical targets44, efficiently transmitting cue information across hip-
pocampal-cortical circuits.
The source of the interneuronal hyperpolarization remains 
unclear. It may be triggered by the brief PV spiking at odor onset, 
whose temporal precision suggests an external drive, rather than 
recurrent inputs. Its ~20 ms lag after cue-onset, though consistent with 
the latency between olfactory bulb (OB) stimulation and hippocampal 
response in rats45,46, would discount the diffusion time needed for the 
odorant to reach the epithelial cells and then the OB, or any sniffing 
cycle variability across trials. This synchronous spiking should also 
hyperpolarize both interneurons and pyramidal cells. Alternatively, the 
hyperpolarization may be driven by a common theta-paced GABAergic 
input from the medial septum on CA1 PV and SST interneurons47,48, 
which could explain the high interneuronal synchrony as well as the 
theta-modulated rebound. The hyperpolarization may also be trig-
gered by interneuron-specific VIP cells49 recruited by lateral entorhinal 
axons50. VIP-mediated disinhibition could explain the pyramidal spik-
ing during the hyperpolarization.
The behavioral correlates of the hyperpolarization are also 
unclear. Low odor selectivity of early-spiking pyramidal cells implies 
that responses <200 ms from odor onset may be driven by inputs 
unrelated to olfaction, such as the clicking sound of the odor-delivering 
air valve or a startle response to it. Indeed, mouse CA1 pyramidal cells 
can exhibit a tone-induced or startle-induced hyperpolarization after 
~120 ms (ref. 51). The entorhinal cortex also responds to auditory cues, 
through glutamatergic medial septal inputs, within <15 ms (ref. 52) and 
could drive early-spiking cells in CA1. On the other hand, the absence 
of a hyperpolarization in every trial and the reduction of its occurrence 
across days, argue against a purely auditory response and in favor of a 
startle or arousal response.
A striking difference with pyramidal sequences, is the sparsity of 
interneuronal fields during the delay, suggesting that PV and SST cells 
receive different inputs than time cells. As most SST cells are driven by 
feedback CA1 excitation, they may integrate inputs from multiple time 
cells during the delay, yielding no temporal tuning. Similarly, PV cells 
may integrate various temporally tuned inputs from CA3 and EC53, both 
of which form spiking sequences similar to CA1 (refs. 54-56).
One limitation in our approach is the lack of differentiation 
between diverse subtypes of PV or SST interneurons with distinct 
morphology and functional roles15,23 and different relationships to 
network patterns25. Imaging single cells in a small FOV also misses 
important population interactions. Future experiments with trans-
genic lines allowing more cell-type-specific GEVI expression, as well 
as recordings with different GEVIs expressed on different cell types 
simultaneously57, will disentangle the role of specific interneuronal 
subtypes and their rich interplay.
However, our findings highlight how voltage imaging can reveal 
cell-type-specific spiking and membrane potential dynamics during 
active behavior, with high temporal resolution58,59 and across long time 
scales of several days. Recent developments of GEVIs with improved 
fluorescence, kinetics and photostability28,31,57,60, render voltage imag-
ing ideal for long-term recording membrane potentials from geneti-
cally identified cells in vivo.

Methods
Animals
A total of ten adult male mice (12-21 weeks old) were used for in vivo 
voltage imaging experiments with the ASAP3 GEVI: five PV-Cre mice 
(B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J) and five SST-IRES-Cre mice (Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J). 
For ASAP4 recordings, five adult SST-IRES-Cre adult mice were used.
For electrophysiological recordings, three adult male and two 
female mice (8-16 weeks old) were used: two PV-Cre, two SST-Cre and 
one wild-type (Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J−/−).
For calcium imaging recordings, 11 adult mice (11-31 weeks 
old) were used: 5 Gad2-Cre:Ai9 mice (Gad2tm2(cre)Zjh/J crossed with 
B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG−tdTomato)Hze/J) and 6 Gad2-Cre:Ai14 
(Gad2tm2(cre)Zjh/J crossed with B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG−tdTomato)Hze/J).
All animals were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory and were 
group housed (2-5 per cage) on a 12-h light-dark cycle. All experimental 
protocols were approved by the Chancellor's Animal Research Com-
mittee of the University of California, Los Angeles, in accordance with 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines.
Surgical procedures
Surgical procedures were described in detail in ref. 5. In brief, 
isoflurane-anesthetized mice were stereotactically injected with 500 nl 
undiluted AAV8-ef1α-DiO-ASAP3-Kv (titer 3.83 × 1012 µg ml−1), using a 
Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific) into the right dorsal 
CA1 area (−2mm posterior and 1.8 mm lateral to bregma, 1.3 mm ven-
tral from dura) at 60 nl min−1. After 1 h, a circular craniotomy (3-mm 
diameter) was made around the injection site and the cortical tissue 
above the dorsal CA1 was aspirated until partial removal of the corpus 
callosum. A 3-mm titanium ring with a glass coverslip attached to its 
bottom was implanted into the aspirated area and secured to the skull. 
A custom-made lightweight metal head holder (headbar) was attached 
to the skull posterior to the implant. Cyanoacrylate glue and black 
dental cement (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental) were used to seal and cover 
the exposed skull. Mice were administered carprofen (5 mg kg−1 of 
body weight) for 3 days post-surgery, as well as amoxicillin antibiotic 
(0.25 mg ml−1 in drinking water) through the water supply for 5 days.
For ASAP4 recordings, the same procedure was followed 
but two animals were injected with AAV8-ef1α -DiO-ASAP4b-Kv 
(titer 2.36 × 1012 vg ml−1) and three animals were injected with 
AAV8-ef1α-DiO-ASAP4e-Kv (titer 3.45 × 1011 vg ml−1). All ASAP viruses 
were produced by the Stanford Neuroscience Gene Vector and Virus 
Core facility.
For two-photon calcium imaging, the same procedure was fol-
lowed but animals were injected with 1,500 nl of 1:10 saline-diluted 
AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 virus (diluted immediately before 
surgery; titer 4.65 × 1013 GC ml−1; Penn Vector Core).
For Neuropixel recordings, mice were subcutaneously admin-
istered preoperative drugs (carprofen 5 mg kg−1, dexamethasone 
0.2 mg kg−1, lidocaine 5 mg kg−1) 30 min before surgery, were then 
isoflurane-anesthetized and were placed into a stereotactic frame, as 
before. After stereotactically aligning the skull, burr holes were made 
and AAV1_hSyn1-SIO-stGtACR2-FusionRed (1,000 nl of 1:10 saline dilu-
tion; Addgene) was injected bilaterally (−2.0 mm posterior, 1.8 mm 
lateral, 1.3 mm ventral from dura) in all mice except the wild-type.  
A headbar was attached to posterior skull and secured with cyanoacr-
ylate glue and dental cement as before. The remaining exposed skull 
and brain were covered and sealed with a silicone elastomer sealant 
(Kwik-Sil, WPI). Following surgery, all animals were given postopera-
tive care (carprofen 5 mg kg−1 and dexamethasone 0.2 mg kg−1 for 48 h 
after surgery) and provided amoxicillin-treated water at 0.5 mg ml−1 for  
7 days. After waiting for 3 weeks to allow viral expression, an additional 
surgery was performed for all mice. Additional small burr holes were 
made 1.5 mm anterior to viral injections for acute cannula placement. 
Another small burr hole was made above the right cerebellum, and a 
silver chloride ground wire was implanted within the hole and fixed 
in place with dental cement. The exposed skull and brain were again 
covered and sealed with the silicone elastomer sealant (Kwik-Sil, WPI). 
Following surgery, all animals were given postoperative care (carpro-
fen 5 mg kg−1 and dexamethasone 0.2 mg kg−1 for 48 h after surgery) 
and provided with amoxicillin-treated water at 0.5 mg ml−1 for 7 days.
Experimental setup for imaging
The behavioral rig used for DNMS recordings was described in ref. 5. 
In brief, mice were head-fixed through a custom-made headbar holder 
on an 8-inch Styrofoam ball treadmill rotating in one dimension. Loco-
motion was recorded using a custom-printed circuit board based on a 
high sensitivity gaming mouse sensor (Avago ADNS-9500), connected 
to a microcontroller (Atmel Atmega328). A constant stream of clear 
air (~1 l min−1) was supplied to the mouse through a custom-made 
lickport. During odor stimulation a dual synchronous three-way valve 
(NResearch), switched from the clear air stream to the odorized air for 
1 s. Odorized air was created using a four-port olfactometer (Rev. 7c; 
Biology Electronics, Caltech), supplying air to either of two glass vials 
containing liquid isoamyl acetate (70% isoamyl acetate basis, FCC; 
Sigma-Aldrich) or pinene ((−)-α-pinene, ≥97%, FCC; Sigma-Aldrich) 
odorants, diluted in mineral oil at a 5% concentration. Odorized air 
reached the rig through Tygon tubing, leading to a dual three-way 
solenoid valve (Lee Company). The olfactometer supplied air to either 
odor vial 1 s before actual stimulation to allow for odorized air to 
travel through the tubing. During the 1-s stimulation, a three-way 
solenoid released it to the mouse through the lickport. At the offset 
of the stimulus, the valve switched the airstream back to clear air, 
ensuring a constant flow of air to the mouse and a quick clearing 
of the odorant from the air around the mouse. The odorized and 
clean air was set to similar airflow values (~1 l min−1), measured with 
a flowmeter (AWM3300; Honeywell). Licking was detected using a 
battery-operated, custom-made, printed circuit board operating as 
a lickometer. Water droplets (~10 µl) were released by a solenoid valve 
(Lee Company). At the end of each trial, after the response window, 
vacuum was applied for 3 s to clear any lingering water and remove any 
odorized air. An additional 7 s of intertrial interval were applied after 
the vacuum. The behavioral rig was controlled with custom-written 
software (MATLAB) and through a data-acquisition board (USB-6341; 
National Instruments).
Voltage imaging was performed with a custom-built, high-speed, 
single-photon, epifluorescent microscope. Photoexcitation was pro-
vided via a fiber-coupled LED (Thorlabs, M455F3) with a center wave-
length of 455 nm. Excitation light was collimated after a 2-m long, 
400-μm core multimode fiber optic patch cord (Thorlabs, M28L02) 
and expanded using a Keplerian telescope. The expanded beam was 
passed through a spectral excitation filter (Thorlabs, MF455-45) and 
reflected off a long-pass dichroic mirror (Thorlabs, MD480) before 
reaching a ×16/0.8 NA water-immersion objective (Nikon, CFI75 LWD 
×16 W). The expander was used to generate a localized excitatory spot 
~165 μm in diameter, at the focal plane. Emitted fluorescence was col-
lected and transmitted through the dichroic mirror and an emission 
filter (Thorlabs, MF530-43) before reaching a 100-mm tube lens (Thor-
labs, AC300-100-A) to form an image on a fast scientific CMOS camera 
(Hamamatsu Photonics, ORCA-Lightning C12120-20P) capable of kHz 
frame rates. The spatial sampling rate of the microscope was calculated 
as ~688 nm and experimentally confirmed using a calibration test 
target. Camera control and image acquisition were performed using 
HCImage Live software v.4.5.1 (Hamamatsu Photonics).
Calcium imaging was described in ref. 5. In brief, a resonant scan-
ning two-photon microscope (Scientifica) was used, recording 512 × 512 
pixel frames at 30.9 Hz, with the same objective as for voltage imaging 
(500 × 500 µm FOV). Excitation light was delivered with a Ti:sapphire 
excitation laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent), operated at 920 nm. 
GCamp6f and tdTomato fluorescence were recorded with green- and 
red-channel gallium arsenide photomultiplier tubes, respectively

(Hamamatsu). Microscope control and image acquisition were per-
formed using LabView-based software (SciScan).
For all recordings, imaging and behavioral data were synchronized 
by recording voltage pulses, generated at the onset of each imaging 
frame, as well as olfactory stimulation digital signals at 1 kHz, using the 
WinEDR software (Strathclyde Electrophysiology Software).
Experimental setup for electrophysiology
Following at least 24 h of recovery after the final surgery, recordings 
took place during DNMS trials, using the same behavioral rig as before. 
Mice underwent two recording sessions while naive to DNMS. Fol-
lowing the second recording session, mice began water deprivation 
and received DNMS training. Recordings resumed 10-11 days later. At 
each session, the elastomer sealant was removed and mineral oil was 
immediately placed on top of the craniotomy to protect the exposed 
brain. The mouse skull was stereotactically aligned. Neuropixels 1.0 
probes (Imec) were lowered, either unilaterally or bilaterally, using a 
micromanipulator into the hippocampus for 2.8 mm and were allowed 
to settle for at least 10 min. Recordings were performed at 30 kHz sam-
pling rate, using PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI) hardware 
from National Instruments and SpikeGLX data-acquisition software 
(http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/). During some recordings (once 
per mouse), Neuropixels were coated with a fluorescent dye (CM-Dil, 
Sigma-Aldrich) before lowering.
For optogenetic experiments in the PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, optic 
fiber cannulas (400 µm Core, 0.39 NA, Thorlabs) were placed 1.5 mm 
anterior to the Neuropixel insertion (unilaterally or bilaterally accord-
ingly) and lowered for 2 mm at 45°, so that fiber tips sat ~0.1 mm anterior 
of the probe and at ~1.4 mm depth. Light stimulation was delivered 
from a 470 nm fiber-coupled LED (Thorlabs) with power set at 4 mW 
out of the optic fiber. Three different stimulation protocols were used:  
(1) stimulation started 30 ms after odor onset and lasted 20 ms, covering 
the brief PV synchronized spiking at odor onset; (2) stimulation started 
50 ms after odor onset and lasted 100 ms, covering the mean hyperpo-
larization window; and (3) stimulation started 200 ms after odor onset 
and lasted 200 ms, covering the mean post-hyperpolarization rebound 
window. The same stimulation was delivered during both odors in each 
DNMS trial. In each recording session, after a set of trials without any 
stimulation, the protocol was alternated after one or more blocks of 20 
trials (maximum four blocks before changing protocol). Protocols 1 and 
3 were delivered for at least one trial block in every session. Protocol 
2 was delivered during four trained sessions (covering all three mice). 
Stimulation was given in a random set of trials (50% on average). In a 
final set of trials, stimulation was given throughout the entire odor cues 
in each trial, but this only suppressed interneuronal spiking for the first 
100-200 ms (possibly due to inhibitory compensation mechanisms) 
and had minimal effects on pyramidal cells. In three sessions, a block 
of no-stimulation trials was also recorded at the end.
Following the completion of each recording, Neuropixels and fiber 
cannulas were stereotactically removed. The exposed brain and skull 
were rinsed with cortex buffer (135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 
1.8 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2) and the elastomer sealant Kwik-Sil was 
replaced.
Histology
Following all experiments, mice were deeply anesthetized under isoflu-
rane and transcardially perfused with 30 ml 1× PBS followed by 30 ml 
4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS at a rate of approximately 4 ml min−1. 
After perfusion, the brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% par-
aformaldehyde. Coronal sections of 80 μm were collected using a 
vibratome, 24-48 h after perfusion and were mounted onto glass slides 
and cover-slipped with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) mounting 
medium. Images were acquired on an Apotome2 microscope (Zeiss; 679 
×5, ×10 and ×20 objectives) to confirm proper expression and location 
of viral SIO-stGtACR2 expression, as well as stained Neuropixel probe 
depth. Sufficient expression in PV or SST interneurons localized within 
CA1, in sections from PV-Cre or SST-Cre mice accordingly, and proper 
probe placement were confirmed.
Behavioral training and voltage imaging protocol
Approximately, 2-4 weeks after surgery, mice were imaged for two 
sessions (separate days) while completely untrained in the DNMS task 
(one SST-Cre mouse was imaged for three sessions). They were pre-
sented with sets of DNMS trials and could passively smell the odor cues. 
Locomotion on the treadmill was typically limited as mice were not 
accustomed to the rig. After the second session, water restriction was 
initiated and DNMS training began in separate training rigs. Protocols 
for water restriction and training to the DNMS task, starting ~10 days 
after surgery, were described in ref. 5. After mice reached performances 
>90% for at least one 20-trial set (75% for one animal; one animal never 
reached criterion but only two cells were recorded post-training), 
voltage imaging resumed. The recording protocol was the same for 
naive and trained performance (see below). Daily recordings typically 
stopped when either the mouse had stopped performing due to water 
satiation or no more cells with sufficient signal could be detected.
All imaging was performed under the custom-made single-photon 
microscope at 1,000 frames per second. Before each recording, we 
searched for cells with strong epifluorescence through a 352 × 352 µm 
FOV (256 × 256 pixels and 2 × 2 pixel-binning). Once a cell was 
located, the FOV was reduced to 88 × 44 µm (64 × 32 pixels with 2 × 2 
pixel-binning), which allowed for longer camera exposure (0.98 ms) 
and digitization at a 1-kHz frame rate. The FOV contained a single cell 
in most cases with only three PV cell recordings (2.8% of all sessions) 
and two SST recordings (2.2%) containing >1 cells within the FOV with 
all cells yielding action potentials. Before DNMS recordings, 3 s of 
activity were recorded. Using ImageJ, we manually segmented the 
recorded video and examined the raw fluorescence of the ROI. Only 
cells that yielded clear action potentials within the 3-s videos were 
further recorded. The power of the LED was adjusted depending on the 
signal-to-noise ratio in the 3-s recording. LED power was typically set 
as low as possible to avoid fast photobleaching but also to allow large 
spike amplitudes. The number of DNMS trials to be delivered was also 
set based on an assessment of the signal and the rate of photobleaching.
At each DNMS trial, LED and frame acquisition were on from 1 s 
before the first odor onset until the offset of the response window (11 s 
total). LED and frame acquisition were off during the 10 s total intertrial 
interval. After a set of trials was recorded, a time break of ~5-10 min was 
given to prevent phototoxicity, while the mouse remained head-fixed 
under the microscope. During this break, the acquired raw traces 
were examined, using ImageJ, for the existence of observable action 
potentials. If action potentials persisted throughout the final trial, a 
new recording of the cell was initiated over an additional set of trials. 
Otherwise, the cell was considered photobleached. In most cases, 
recording of a cell stopped after an adequate number of trials was 
recorded, before the cell was bleached. This allowed us to record cells 
for multiple consecutive days. After recording a particular cell, the 
FOV was expanded back to 352 × 352 µm and a small number of frames 
were recorded. The average frame of this video (ImageJ) was used as 
reference to locate the same cell on following days, based on cell body 
shape as well as processes and surrounding features.
For experiments with odors turned off, the olfactometer ports 
were manually deactivated in every other trial, halting any flow of odor-
ized air. Trials were otherwise normal, including all auditory cues from 
the three-way valve. For detached air valve experiments, the three-way 
valve was manually detached from the rig for a subset of trials but 
remained connected and operational.
Voltage imaging data processing
Each recorded video, together with the corresponding behavioral 
data, was processed separately using the Volpy automated pipeline

for voltage imaging in Python30. The video was first motion corrected 
using the rigid NoRMCorre61 algorithm as implemented in the CaImAn 
toolbox62. Parameters like the size of a kernel for high-pass spatial 
filtering or the maximum rigid shift were adjusted between videos to 
achieve efficient motion correction. Initial ROI bounds were manually 
drawn around the recorded cell(s) using a graphical user interface in 
Volpy. Trace extraction, background removal and denoising together 
with spike time estimation took place through a reiterative process, 
based on the constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) 
algorithm63 and a modified version of the SpikePursuit algorithm64. In 
each iteration, estimated background is removed from the extracted 
trace, spikes are selected from local maxima using an adaptive thresh-
old, a spike template is computed and is used for whitened matched 
filtering the trace to enhance the spikes and then re-detect them.  
A reconstructed trace, obtained by convolving the spike template and 
the inferred spike train, is then used to refine the spatial footprint of 
the ROI through Ridge regression, and start the next iteration (typically 
three iterations performed). Final ΔF/F was computed as (t − tsub) / tsub 
where t is the refined temporal fluorescence trace and tsub is an esti-
mated subthreshold trace. ΔF/F was inverted for all ASAP3 recordings 
but not for ASAP4 recordings. Parameters involved in trace denoising 
and spike detection, such as frequency for high-pass filtering to remove 
photobleaching or the maximum number of spikes to form the spike 
template, were adjusted between videos to ensure the accurate detec-
tion of action potentials that could be seen in the raw trace. Processing 
took place over the entire video with concatenated trials; traces and 
spike times were then split into the corresponding trials.
Analysis of voltage imaging data
All analysis was performed using custom-written software in MATLAB.
Motion analysis. The locomotion signal was recorded at 1 kHz. Its 
mode value was subtracted, then it was turned to absolute values and 
smoothed with a first-order Savitzky-Golay filter. Motion segments 
were taken to be those where the locomotion signal exceeded 0.02 
and immobility was assumed when it dropped 0.01 (a.u.). Consecutive 
motion segments closer than 20 ms were concatenated and segments 
shorter than 10 ms were discarded.
Immobility during the first odor (Extended Data Fig. 2), was con-
sidered when smoothed locomotion (50 ms moving average), averaged 
across the odor delivery, was <0.02 (a.u.). Otherwise, the trial was 
considered to have locomotion during the odor.
Spiking and subthreshold membrane potential analysis. Initially, 
all processed sets of trials from each neuron in a session, along with the 
behavioral data, were concatenated and considered one continuous 
recording of that cell. The quality of processing from each recording 
was assessed visually. Cells that yielded signals that were too noisy, 
with problematic spike detection or with no spikes, were removed 
from analysis. Trials at the end of a recording containing very few or no 
spikes, due to phototoxicity or bleaching, were also removed.
Firing rates were computed by binning the extracted spike times 
of each trial at 100 ms or 5 ms (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 5) nono-
verlapping bins. Interspike intervals were computed for each trial 
separately. The burst index of a neuron was quantified as the percent-
age of spikes closer than 10 ms, over its total number of spikes. Spike 
amplitudes were computed as the ΔF/F difference between average 
spike peak and baseline (average ΔF/F from 20 to 60 ms before the 
spike) and halfwidths as the average distance between half-peak time 
points per spike.
Speed scores were computed as the trial-averaged correlations 
between a cell's firing rates (smoothed with a five-point moving-average 
window in each trial) and the animal's locomotion in the correspond-
ing trials (downsampled to match the firing rate sampling rate). Odor 
scores were the trial-averaged correlations between a cell's firing rate 
and a vector of trial length, containing 1 s in the odor delivery time bins 
and 0 s in all other time bins.
Analyses of subthreshold membrane potentials were based on 
de-spiked versions of the ΔF/F signal. Spike removal was performed 
through a Bayesian method, developed for removing spike waveforms 
from LFPs to eliminate artifactual spike-LFP correlations65. A segment 
of 25 ms around each detected spike (5 ms before and 19 ms after the 
action potential peak) was replaced in the ΔF/F based on Bayesian 
inference. Due to the action potential widening by GEVIs, this segment 
encompassed the average recorded action potential and the ensuing 
after-hyperpolarization.
Power spectra were computed separately on concatenated motion 
or immobility de-spiked ΔF/F segments from each cell, through a modi-
fied periodogram using a Kaiser window with a frequency resolution 
of 0.5 Hz. Power spectrograms were computed through Short-Time 
Fourier Transform of the de-spiked ΔF/F of each cell in each trial, across 
512-ms windows with 256-ms overlap and 0.1 Hz frequency resolution. 
They were two-dimensionally interpolated and then smoothed with 
a two-dimensional Gaussian smoothing kernel (σ = 5). Mean spec-
trograms were fitted by a power law model that was then removed to 
flatten the spectrograms.
Theta phases and amplitudes were computed from the Hilbert 
transform of the de-spiked ΔF/F after bandpassing it in the 4-10 Hz 
frequency range, using a third-order Butterworth filter. The phase of 
each spike was computed as the angle of the Hilbert transform at the 
spike peak. Theta amplitude traces were smoothed with a first-order 
Savitzky-Golay filter. Mean amplitudes were estimated as the mean 
amplitude across all trials and all time points. Average theta phase of a 
cell's spikes and mean vector length (strength of theta modulation) and 
phase variance were computed using the Circstat toolbox66. To compute 
the relationship between firing rates and intracellular theta power with 
locomotion or odors, (Extended Data Fig. 1), the first and last 700 ms in 
each trial were removed to avoid edge artifacts arising from small ΔF/F 
distortions when high-pass filtering the original, concatenated fluo-
rescence trace to remove low frequency photobleaching components.
For hyperpolarization analysis, non-de-spiked ΔF/F traces were 
smoothed by first-order Savitzky-Golay filter and z-scored to the mean 
and s.d. of the 0.5 s preceding the onset of the first odor (baseline) in 
each trial separately. Time segments where this z-scored trace S was 
S < −1 during to the first odor delivery were detected. The first con-
tinuous time segment Th (including all segments closer than 20 ms) 
was considered a potential hyperpolarization. If Th had total duration 
of >50 ms and contained time points where S < −3 with total duration 
>10 ms, then Th was considered a significant hyperpolarization. The 
first time point, the total length and the S minimum value of Th were 
taken as the hyperpolarization onset time, duration and amplitude 
respectively. The timing of minimum S value was taken as the hyper-
polarization trough timing. For comparisons including low number of 
recorded cells (Extended Data Fig. 5), the minimum value of S within 
the first 200 ms after odor onset, in every trial, was taken as the hyper-
polarization amplitude.
For relationships between hyperpolarization amplitude and loco-
motion/theta/firing rates (Extended Data Fig. 4), average locomotion 
or theta amplitude was computed between each trial's hyperpolariza-
tion onset and offset time points, in trials with significant hyperpo-
larization. Post-hyperpolarization firing rates were computed from 
hyperpolarization offset till end of odor cue. For relationships between 
rate of hyperpolarization and the above measures, average locomo-
tion or theta amplitude was computed over the first 150 ms after odor 
onset and averaged across all trials, whereas post-hyperpolarization 
rates were computed after the first 150 ms till end of odor cue. Trials 
with the lowest and highest locomotion during hyperpolarization 
(Extended Data Fig. 4) were those where the average locomotion during 
hyperpolarization, in trials with significant hyperpolarization, were in 
the lowest or highest fifth percentile of the distribution, respectively.

For fine-timescale analysis (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 5), firing 
rates (5-ms bins) were smoothed with a three-point moving-average 
window. Odor-onset and rebound spiking corresponded to the bins 
within 30-50 ms and 200-500 ms after odor onset, respectively. Cor-
responding average rates referred to the mean firing rate value across 
the respective time bins and across all trials. Firing increase was com-
puted as the relative change of the trial-averaged rate (mean across the 
corresponding time bins) to its baseline average rate (mean over the 
0.5 s preceding the odor).
All plotted ΔF/F traces were normalized by their maximum value 
over each trial. Plotted firing rates over individual trials, as well as aver-
age rates, were z-scored based on their mean and s.d. across the odor 
delivery interval. Firing rates or theta amplitude traces were smoothed 
by a five-point moving-average window for plotting.
Field detection and analysis. The firing rate across each trial was 
smoothed with a five-point moving-average window. Firing rate 
signals over the odor-delay interval (from onset of first odor to end 
of the delay period) were z-scored in each trial and split over trials 
initiated by odor A or odor B. The average rate was computed for 
each set and the corresponding maximum values were noted for 
each. The two sets of firing rate traces were then circularly shifted by 
a random interval up to ± 1/2 odor-delay interval duration, separately 
for each trial, and the maximum average firing rate over the shifted 
trials was again computed. This process was repeated 1,000 times, 
generating a distribution of maximal rate values. The cell was con-
sidered to have a significant firing field for a particular odor, if the 
corresponding maximum mean firing rate was larger than the 95th 
percentile of the shuffled distribution. The time bin of that maximal 
rate was considered the cell's field time bin. Cells with firing fields for 
both initiating odors were considered non-odor-specific. For these 
cells, if their field time bins for each odor were closer than 1 s, then 
their final field was considered the mean of the two time bins. If their 
field time bins were further apart than 1 s, then their field was the bin 
where the maximal average rate was higher. This only occurred in 
three PV cells (2.8% of all PV cells) and four SST cells (4.3%). For cells 
with no field, the time bin of their maximal average firing rate over 
all trials was computed.
The selectivity index (SI) of each cell was then computed as:
SI =
RA
f −RB
f
RA
f + RB
f
where Ri
f is the cell's mean firing rate at its field (or at the time bin of 
maximal mean firing rate in the case of no-field cells) over all trials initi-
ated by odor i. Cells that were initially detected as being odor-specific 
but had |SI| < 0.42 were considered as non-odor-specific. This criterion 
was implemented because many cells with similar firing rates in both 
odors were erroneously classified as odor-specific due to noisy spiking 
in other time bins as well. Chance odor selectivity for each cell was 
approximated by applying the above formula between two random 
sets of trials (of equal size on average), repeated 1,000 times. This 
distribution was concatenated across cells and averaged.
A cell's firing rate change at different trial segments was computed 
as the trial-averaged relative change of its mean rate over the corre-
sponding time bins, compared to its mean rate over the 0.8 s preceding 
the first odor (baseline).
Analysis across multiple days. The inflow of new odor fields at any 
session was computed as the percentage of cells of day d with an odor 
field that were also imaged in the previous session but did not exhibit 
a significant odor field then. Stable cells are defined as the percentage 
of cells of day d with an odor field that were also imaged in the previous 
session and did exhibit a significant odor field then too. The outflow of 
odor fields at a session was computed as the percentage of cells from 
the previous session with an odor field that were also imaged on the 
current one but did not retain an odor field.
For comparing between the firing rates or theta oscillations of 
tracked cells while the mouse was naive versus trained, we used the 
first trained session where the cell was imaged to compare against the 
one naive session where the cell was imaged (for one PV cell that was 
imaged on two naive sessions, we used the second session).
For cross-days correlations, firing rates over the odor-delay 
interval were z-scored for each trial and the Pearson correlation was 
computed for all pairs of trials between the two sessions. The mean 
correlation was computed.
The Spearman rank correlation was estimated for the relationship 
between mean pairwise correlations and distance between imaging 
sessions.
When estimating the evolution of collective activity from all cells 
across days, the one extra naive session in a single SST-Cre mouse 
was removed for analysis (so that all mice had two naive sessions). 
Performance was computed over the pooled trials from all trial blocks 
recorded with each cell. Rates, locomotion and theta amplitudes were 
averaged across the entire recording. For naive sessions, all perfor-
mances were set to 50% corresponding to chance, as mice did not 
participate in the DNMS task.
Theta power refers to the mean theta amplitude over odor-delay 
interval and across trials.
Support vector machine and Bayesian decoding. For both decod-
ing methods, trials from each cell were analyzed separately. The first 
two-thirds of all trials were used for training and the final one-third for 
decoding. Only recordings with at least ten trials total and at least two 
training trials of each odor were included. Rates over each trial were 
smoothed with a five-point moving-average window.
Binary SVM classifiers were created to decode the identity of 
the first odor in a trial. They were trained on the cell's firing rates 
either across the first odor delivery or the entire odor-delay interval. 
Smoothed rates were z-scored over the corresponding bins in each 
trial. The classifier was trained using a radial basis function kernel with 
automatically selected scale factor and standardized predictors (func-
tion fitcsvm, MATLAB). Chance baseline for each cell was computed 
by shuffling the identity of both training and predicted odors with 
500 repetitions and applying the SVM classifier on each repetition. 
Odor-decoding accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly decoded 
odors over all predicted trials.
Bayesian decoders were created to decode odor-specific timing in 
a trial, using a similar approach as reported in ref. 5. They were trained 
on the cell's firing rates across the odor-delay interval. The rate of each 
trial was scaled to have a maximum value equal to the maximum over 
all trials. To decode the odor identity, we considered time space to be 
2× odor-delay interval, by concatenating along the time axis, each cell's 
mean rate over the two initiating odors (mean rate over odor A-initiated 
trials followed by mean rate over odor B-initiated trials). The decoder, 
trained by these concatenated firing rates, would thus predict a time 
point along a doubled time interval, 12-s long. If the time point was 
within the first half (0-6 s) it corresponded to that time point of an odor 
A trial, whereas if it was within the second half (6-12 s) it corresponded 
to the analogous time point of an odor B trial. Time bins with no activity 
in either group of trials were discarded.
The decoded time point ̂Tt from the cell's spiking at time bin t in a 
decoded trial is given by:
̂Tt = argmax
t
(C (s (t) , t) K(t) τRm (t)
s(t)
s (t)!
e−τRm(t)e
|t−̂Tt−1|2
2σ2
)
where s(t) is the number of spikes at time bin t, Rm(t) is the cell's mean 
firing rate across odor A trials concatenated with that across odor B tri-
als, at time bin t, τ is the bin duration (100 ms) and K is the probability of

being at time bin t of a trial initiated by a particular odor (proportional 
to the ratio of trials of that odor over all training trials) and C(t) is a 
probability normalization factor. The last term functions as a conti-
nuity constraint, limiting the decoded time bin to a relative proximity 
to the previous one, with σ = 3 s. Chance baselines were computed by 
randomly circularly shifting the time bins of each trial to be decoded, 
with 500 repetitions, and decoding the shifted trials for each repetition. 
Decoded time error refers to the mean absolute time distance between 
a given time point and the decoded one, irrespective of the initiating 
odor. It thus functions as a measure of the time-information carried by 
the cell. Odor-decoding accuracy refers to the percentage of correct 
odor decoding at any given time point (decoded time bin being in the 
correct half of extended time axis).
On, off trials. Locomotion and ΔF/Fs were smoothed with first-order 
Savitzky-Golay filter. Rates were smoothed with a five-point moving- 
average window. For each cell, all three measures were normalized 
by the maximum across trials of their mean-per-trial across the odor- 
delay interval.
Processing and spike sorting of electrophysiological data
Spikes were sorted offline using Kilosort2 (ref. 67) with default param-
eters and criteria for single-unit clustering. Manual curation of labeled 
units included merging and splitting units based on quality metrics 
using Phy2.0 (https://github.com/kwikteam/phy). A putative single unit 
had to meet the following conditions: (1) the proportion of refractory 
violations must be <5%; (2) spike amplitudes throughout the record-
ing distributed normally with 95% of spikes separated from the noise 
source; and (3) mean firing rate >0.5 Hz.
LFPs were downsampled to 2.5 kHz and 60 Hz noise was removed, 
together with 120 and 180 Hz harmonics, using second-order Butter-
worth IIR bandstop filters. The channel corresponding to CA1 pyrami-
dal layer was manually estimated based on where theta phase reversal 
(assessed visually) occurred during locomotion as well as where rip-
ple amplitudes were highest and were combined with sharp waves 
in deeper layers. Ripples were detected, as reported in ref. 68, when 
the amplitude (binned root mean square) of 120-200 Hz bandpassed 
LFPs exceeded 10 s.d. and ripple boundaries were set when the ampli-
tude dropped below 2 s.d. Ripples lasting <40 ms were discarded and 
consecutive ones <50 ms apart were concatenated. The theta- and 
ripple-based criteria pointed to similar channels. Units were assigned 
to channels yielding highest action potential amplitude. Units assigned 
to channels within 100 µm from the CA1 channel were assumed to be 
within the CA1 pyramidal layer and stratum oriens and were kept for 
further analysis. For bilateral recordings, this was conducted indepen-
dently for each probe.
Units were clustered into putative pyramidal cells (broad) and 
interneurons (narrow spiking)69. The amplitudes and time points of 
each unit's mean waveform peak and trough were computed, together 
with the unit's mean firing rate. Principal-component analysis was 
performed on (1) the peak-trough time distance; (2) the peak-trough 
amplitude ratio; and (3) the mean firing rate across no-stimulation tri-
als, of pooled units of all animals after z-scoring them. Scores from the 
three principal components were split into two clusters using k-means 
with squared Euclidean distance measure and 100 clustering repeats, 
yielding two well-separated clusters with one containing ~16% of all 
units with shorter peak-trough distances and ratios and higher firing 
rates. Narrow spiking units in that cluster are considered as putative 
interneurons, whereas those in the opposite cluster are considered as 
putative pyramidal cells. Sparse spiking cells with mean rates across 
no-stimulation trials <0.5 Hz were discarded.
Analysis of electrophysiological data
Firing rates were computed over 10-ms nonoverlapping bins. Odor 
responses were quantified as smoothed firing rates (with a 50-ms 
window Gaussian-weighted average), normalized by baseline (mean 
rate across the 1 s before the first odor in a trial) and averaged across 
the first odor cue. Example raster plots depict pooled trials with no 
stimulation.
Detection of significant fields followed the algorithm reported in 
ref. 5 but was applied to firing rates, smoothed with a Gaussian-weighted 
average (300-ms window) and z-scored per trial. For plotting, smoothed 
sequence-cell rates were averaged over corresponding trials and were 
normalized by their maximum value over the odor-delay interval. 
Odor selectivity indexes were computed across pooled trials without 
stimulation. They were quantified as before with positive value for the 
preferred odor, irrespective of odor identity. Changes in firing rates by 
optogenetic stimulation, were assessed only across trials of the trial 
block(s) with the corresponding stimulation protocol, comparing trials 
with and without stimulation. This method avoided comparisons being 
affected by unit drift, slow changes in unit activity or by any spiking 
influences by preceding stimulation protocols.
Two-photon calcium imaging and data processing and analysis
The recording protocol and calcium data processing was described 
in ref. 5. In brief, two-photon imaging sessions started ~2-3 weeks 
post-surgery while mice were either in DNMS training or were well 
trained. A single fixed FOV was imaged every day for each mouse.  
A total of 58 recording sessions from 11 mice were included. Calcium 
data were processed in MATLAB using a custom-built pipeline based 
on the CaImAn package62. GABAergic neurons were identified based 
on their static tdTomato fluorescence recorded for 500 frames at the 
beginning of each session on the red-channel photomultiplier tube, 
together with the functional (green) channel. The ROIs from each 
channel were then registered and ROIs from the green channel that 
matched those from the red were discarded, so that only pyramidal 
cell activity from the green channel was analyzed further.
Pooled cells were sorted based on the mean value of the trial- 
averaged deconvolved signal, over the first odor in each trial. The 
trial-averaged deconvolved signal was then z-scored. The mean value 
of the z-scored signal over the first odor was used as the cell's odor 
response. Detection of significant fields followed the algorithm 
reported in ref. 5 but was applied to the raw deconvolved signal here, 
instead of its binned version.
When plotting pooled field-cell spiking (Fig. 6f), average decon-
volved signals over preferred or nonpreferred trials were normalized 
by the cell's mean signal at its field. Example deconvolved signals 
(Fig. 6b) as well as trial-average ones were smoothed with a five-point 
moving-average window for plotting.
Statistics and reproducibility
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample 
sizes of mice and recorded neurons are similar to those reported in 
in vivo voltage imaging studies (for example see refs. 58,59), calcium 
imaging (for example see refs. 5,56) and time-cell studies (for example 
see refs. 7-9). They were based on reliably measuring experimental 
parameters through large numbers of neurons, while minimizing 
the number of experimental animals. Mice with poor viral expres-
sion of ASAP3 or GCaMP6f or mice with problematic craniotomies 
were excluded before experiments. ASAP3-expressing cells with 
poor signal-to-noise ratio that did not generate detectable spikes 
were not recorded. One mouse with problematic Neuropixel probe 
placement was excluded from the analysis. Mice were not split into 
groups. Experiments were not randomized and the Investigators 
were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome  
assessment.

Software and code
Policy information about availability of computer code
Data collection
Voltage imaging data were collected using the HCImage Live v4.5.1 software (Hamamatsu). Calcium data were recorded using the SciScan 
software (Scientifica). Neuropixel data were collected with Spike GLX. All other data collection was performed using custom written code in 
Matlab (2016b). Time stamps for recording data points and for behavioral data were generated with WinEDR (Strathclyde Electrophysiology) 
Data analysis
Initial processing of voltage imaging data was performed with a modified version of the Volpy numerical pipeline (Cai et al. PLOS Comp Biol 
2021) in Python. Initial processing of Neuropixel data was performed with Kilosort2 and Phy2.0. Initial processing of calcium data was 
performed with a custom-built pipeline based on CaImAn (Giovannucci et al. Elife 2019) in Matlab (as in Taxidis et al. Neuron 2020). All other 
data analyses were performed using custom written code in Matlab (2016b)   
 
All custom-written Matlab code is available at https://github.com/jtaxidis-sickkids/Taxidis-et-al.-2025
For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and 
reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.

Data
Policy information about availability of data
All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable: 
- Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets 
- A description of any restrictions on data availability 
- For clinical datasets or third party data, please ensure that the statement adheres to our policy 
 
Pooled, processed, voltage imaging datasets are available at 10.5281/zenodo.15299606. Unprocessed voltage imaging data from each individual session, as well as 
electrophysiology and calcium imaging datasets, are available by the corresponding authors upon reasonable request. This is due to the large file sizes for most 
generated datasets and the complexity and diversity of experimental conditions and file-types (e.g. pairing voltage imaging files with behavior files and timestamp 
files for each recording session). Our lab can best help with accessing and organizing data according to specific requests.

All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
Sample size
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes of mice and recorded neurons are described in detail in 
Methods and are similar to those typically reported by us and other labs, in the fields of in vivo voltage imaging (e.g. Adam et al. 2019, Fan et 
al. 2023), calcium imaging (e.g. Taxidis et al. 2020, Dorian et al. 2024) and time cell analysis (e.g. Pastalkova et al. 2008, MacDonald et al. 
2011,2013). They were based on reliably measuring experimental parameters through a large number of neurons, while minimizing the 
number of experimental animals to remain in compliance with ethical guidelines.
Data exclusions
Mice with poor viral expression of ASAP3 or GCaMP6f accordingly or mice with problematic craniotomies were excluded prior to experiments. 
ASAP3-expressing cells with poor signal-to-noise ratio that did not generate detectable spikes were not recorded. Recorded trials where the 
cell had become photo-bleached (no spikes or very poor spikes detected for all ensuing trials) were excluded from analysis as described in the 
Methods section of the manuscript. One mouse with problematic Neuropixel probe placement was excluded from the analysis.
Replication
Each mouse was recorded separately during each imaging or electrophysiology session. For voltage imaging, most cells were also recorded 
separately as described in Methods. Each recording session was processed separately. Successful replication is inferred by the fact that similar 
results were observed when comparing across neurons recorded in a mouse, as well as when comparing across separate mice and when 
pooling data from all corresponding mice across each experiment.
Randomization
Mice were not split into experimental groups. All DNMS trials were randomized so that each mouse received a random combination of odors 
in each trial, during both training and recording sessions. For data analyses, randomized shuffling of data or chance baselines were created as 
described in Methods, using standard algotirhtms in Matlab. 
Blinding
Experiments and analyses were not performed blind since mice were not split to experimental groups.
