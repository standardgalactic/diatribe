Abstract
Although it is widely accepted that abstract reasoning and schooling are crucial for occupational success and
human capital development in wage-based labor markets, the pathways by which schooling affects cognition
remain unclear. This study examines the effects of a pervasive cultural institution, formal schooling, on
the development of children's abstract reasoning skills over a four-year period in the Bolivian Amazon
(n = 290 children; 8-18 years; 42% female). Assessing school attributes, children's school-derived skills
and nutritional status, and parental factors on children's abstract reasoning, we find that children attending
higher quality schools score higher on abstract reasoning assessments relative to children attending low-
quality schools. Performance gaps persist and increase over time, suggesting that higher school quality is
a positive and more important causal determinant of abstract reasoning than many child- and family-level
characteristics during population transitions to obligate formal schooling.

1. Introduction
Education has been recognized as an engine of social and economic growth for millennia, and advo-
cates for global access to education consider formal schooling (FS) a critical component in the reduction of
economic inequality (Besley & Burgess, 2003). Children have long been the focus of educational policies
that aim to promote future economic productivity and civic engagement (Smithers et al., 2018) and reduce
poverty (Lim et al., 2018). Experimental research on effects of FS indicates improvements in a variety of
cognitive skills, such as reasoning and problem-solving (Ritchie & Tucker-Drob, 2018; Van de Werfhorst &
Mijs, 2010), and "non-cognitive" skills, such as patience and goal setting (Heckman & Kautz, 2012). In turn,
these skills predict diverse measures of life quality, including health (Amin et al., 2013), social competence
(Bowles & Gintis, 2002) and income (Ishikawa & Ryan, 2002). Though there has been considerable ad-
vances in the understanding of cognition and learning over the last 50 years, there are still many unanswered
questions regarding the role that cultural variation, as well as the pervasiveness of cultural institutions, play
in the development of cognitive skills during childhood.
1.1. Formal schooling is a cultural institution
Compulsory public schooling is a relatively recent institution in human history that, over the last 150
years, has replaced self-directed play, exploration, and some methods of social learning as typical forms of
education and socialization (Davis et al., 2021a; Kline, 2015). Beginning in the 1960s, considerable psy-
chological research investigated the role of FS on cognition (see Cole 1997; Cole & Scribner 1974; Rogoff
1981 for reviews of the literature) by focusing attention on cognition and learning in schooled versus un-
schooled populations. This work built on groundbreaking work conducted by Luria (1976) in the early 20th
century. Results from these renewed efforts concluded that fundamental differences did not exist in reason-
ing capacities across populations, though there were marked differences in patterns of thought, particularly
between schooled and unschooled groups. Notable, and relevant to this study, their findings demonstrated
that while unschooled populations are capable of using abstract categories (after training), this type of rea-
soning appeared to be highly counter-intuitive approach for groups without the peculiar experience of formal
(Western) schooling. In other words, FS is not only transmitting knowledge, but it also likely shapes core
aspects of human cognition and behavior. However, building on this work has proven difficult because once
2

a population has been exposed to FS, and over generations, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of FS
from other relevant demographic and behavioral factors that may also influence the development of abstract
reasoning skills (Ardila & Rosselli, 2007; Cahan & Cohen, 1989; Cahan & Davis, 1987).
More recently, models of cultural evolution that emphasize the adaptive nature of human cognition—
specifically the ways that many aspects of psychology mold or calibrate to incentives created by social norms
and institutions, including the complex dynamics associated with the social transmission of knowledge, the
accumulation of culture, and social change across temporal scales (Boyd et al., 2011; Cavalli-Sforza et al.,
1982; Mesoudi et al., 2015; Muthukrishna et al., 2018; Richerson & Boyd, 1995)—has engaged a new cross-
disciplinary effort to investigate various aspects of human psychology and behavior outside the Global North
(Henrich et al., 2010; Schultz, 1961). However, given the tremendous variability in culture and FS across the
globe, many cross-cultural experimental studies that focus specifically on cognitive development, education,
or learning struggle with some limitations (Muthukrishna et al., 2020), including biasing testing towards
skills deemed valuable in Western societies (Clegg et al., 2017; Legare et al., 2018). Additional difficulties
associated with relevancy and translatability can often complicate the use of standardized assessments in
diverse settings (Greenfield, 1997; Hruschka et al., 2018; Medin et al., 2010), making interpreting results
difficult.
Limited ethnographic, behavioral, and sociocultural data collection in many studies can create addi-
tional issues, especially when attempting to identify causal mechanisms associated with the development
of cognitive skills. One prevalent example of this is the reliance on years of schooling or highest grade
level achieved in cross-cultural, comparative research (Lim et al., 2018), rather than focusing on educational
quality or community-level cognitive skill development. This impedes the ability to directly assess how vari-
ation in quality of FS—which disproportionately affects children in lower income communities, developing
nations, and transitioning populations (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2020)—can influence human capital de-
velopment (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2008; Heckman & Kautz, 2012) and augment inequality (Heckman,
2011; Kaplan, 1996).
1.2. Schooling and abstract reasoning
Formal education may be related to abstract reasoning skills via several potential pathways. Early FS
focuses in part on teaching children how to read, understand what is read, and perform basic mathematical
operations. Proficiency in literacy and numeracy—a focus of this study—is frequently linked to measures
of cognitive performance (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving; Geary 2011; Stanovich et al. 1984) and adult
3

socioeconomic status (SES). While learning literacy and numeracy, children develop new problem-solving
techniques (Reis & Castro-Caldas, 1997; Schoenfeld, 1992), such as abstract and analytical reasoning, which
may be employed across domains and are themselves associated with improved cognitive performance (Dias
et al., 2005; Ritchie et al., 2015). Another aspect of FS experience that may be particularly salient in studying
performance effects on children's abstract reasoning include children's familiarity with features of the testing
conditions, which are similar to school tasks.
1.3. Study goals and predictions
Here, we present a longitudinal study of the effects of FS quality on children's abstract reasoning among
the Tsimane of the Bolivian Amazon. We consider specific school attributes, children's school-derived skills
and nutritional status, and parental education and wealth, which have all been linked in studies across disci-
plines to academic performance and abstract reasoning skills. Including these conditions provides a unique
opportunity to examine the effects of FS on abstract reasoning among children between the ages of 8 and 18.
For example, school-derived skills reflect content of what's learned in classroom, while parental educational
and wealth reflect children's larger learning environments, prior exposures, and potential intergenerational
cognitive correlations.
The implementation of Bolivia's educational reforms in the mid-2000s made sizable, but unequally dis-
tributed, shifts in the availability of educational materials, internal (i.e., school-level) practices, and teacher
training, leading to greater variation in school quality (Jiménez & Vera, 2010; UDAPE-UNICEF, 2008).
Relatively uniform economic, cultural, and ecological conditions experienced by Tsimane, combined with
variation in quality of FS, provide a rare opportunity for studying effects of school quality on cognition
(see Methods and Supplemental). One aspect of cognition that is often linked to positive life outcomes in
post-industrial populations is fluid ability (i.e., novel problem-solving), which is often measured through the
capacity to reason abstractly (Deary et al., 2007). However, higher fluid ability is likely influenced by one's
learning environment (Bratsberg & Rogeberg, 2018) and can improve with training on other cognitive skills,
such as working memory (Jaeggi et al., 2008). Given that the current global estimate for the number of chil-
dren that underperform on cognitive and academic assessments exceeds 200 million (Grantham-McGregor
et al., 2007), and evidence linking structural variation in brain development associated with fluid ability to
poverty (Hair et al., 2015), abstract reasoning has become an important focus of contemporary cognitive
research.
Here we evaluate multi-level predictors of abstract reasoning among Tsimane (mean±SD age[years]=12.5±3.0;
4

age range: 8-18; 42% female, n=290 children) using Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM),
a commonly used 36-item instrument that does not require literacy (Pasquali et al., 2002). We ranked
schools by quality based on a composite index incorporating teacher-child ratio, teacher training, and the
amount/diversity of school resources (see Methods) and test whether FS quality is positively associated with
RCPM score (P1a). We further test whether, in a cross-section, age-related differences in RCPM score are
greater for children attending higher quality schools (P1b).
We next examine direct and indirect pathways through which school quality may affect variation in
children's abstract reasoning. We include in generalized linear models various child- and family-level factors
that reflect different reasons why FS may associate with cognitive test scores. These factors have been
reliably associated with cognitive test scores in the literature and are relevant in the Tsimane context. We
assess conditional indirect effects with moderated mediation analysis. Higher school attendance indicates
greater FS exposure, and potential scholastic interest on the part of the child and/or parents. School-derived
skills (i.e., reading ability, arithmetic ability) reflect a combination of child ability and quality of learning
environment. These factors should positively associate with greater RCPM scores (P2). Likewise, parents'
educational attainment and household wealth should also positively associate with higher RCPM scores
to the extent that these factors provide additional advantages to children (Von Stumm & Plomin, 2015).
If these advantages are important enough, they should reduce the independent effect of school quality on
RCPM score. If attendance, reading ability and arithmetic ability do not, or only partially, mediate the effect
of school quality on RCPM score, then this could suggest that non-scholastic aspects of school quality (e.g.,
motivation) are also important. If children with identical school-derived skills score higher on RCPM when
attending higher quality schools, this suggests a moderating effect of the broader learning environment on
RCPM score.
Finally, using longitudinal RCPM data spanning four years, we test whether relevant factors at study
baseline, and the effect of school quality, persist over time, specifically among those children who self-
selected to continue schooling (P3).
2. Methods
2.1. Study population and features of the experiment
Though historically the Tsimane were only minimally integrated into broader Bolivian society, the rel-
atively recent (past∼40-50 years) introduction of roads, outboard motors for canoes, and subsequent en-
croachment by neighboring Bolivian ranchers and loggers have increased market access and wage labor
5

opportunities for many Tsimane villages (Gurven et al., 2015), particularly those located near the town of
San Borja. San Borja (pop'n ∼43,000) is the largest town and market center near the Tsimane territory.
As such, San Borja travel distance is a reasonable proxy of village-level acculturation, but this proxy is
unrelated to school quality (See Table S1). Thus, we avoid potential confounding effects of market "accul-
turation" (e.g., more frequent market transactions, exposure to diverse media including television and books)
on abstract reasoning (Greenfield & Beagles-Roos, 1988) when assessing effects of school quality.
However, as forager-horticulturalists and at the time of this study, the Tsimane in the study villages still
do not rely primarily on a cash-based market economy. As a result, they lack significant material wealth
and wealth inequality across the population (Godoy et al., 2004; Jaeggi et al., 2020). All Tsimane are
also from the same ethnolinguistic group, making them culturally and linguistically homogenous relative to
industrialized populations, which helps avoid some endogeneity biases identified in cross-cultural research
(Nisbett, 2009). Thus, the current study avoids several salient sources of endogeneity, enabling us to better
isolate effects of schooling (quantity and quality) and school-derived skills on children's performance at
time-1 and prospective abstract reasoning. However, while child nutritional status and other ecological
conditions vary less than that of populations commonly studied in the child development literature, variation
within villages may still be associated with cognitive outcomes. Thus, we treat children's nutritional status
and family-level factors (i.e., parental education, travel distance to school, and household wealth) as both
controls and predictors that may affect reasoning independently and/or interactively with schooling.
2.2. Formal schooling among Tsimane
In the 1990s, Bolivia's government began enacting laws to increase indigenous representation and ex-
pand educational reforms (Howard, 2009). The election of Evo Morales as president in 2005 instituted
sweeping changes to domestic educational policy, including efforts to install more qualified teachers, build
more schools, and adopt a standardized academic curriculum. By the early 2000s, only about 40% of
Tsimane villages had primary schools (1st-5th grade), and none had secondary schools (Godoy et al.,
2007). Shortly after Morales' election, new schools were established in the Tsimane territory (∼1.2 mil-
lion hectares) within just a couple of years. Prior to Morales's election, village teachers had mostly been
Tsimane who were trained by local missionaries, but after the election many teachers were replaced by
government-certified non-Tsimane with more schooling from the Bolivian highlands (Reyes-García et al.,
2010).
Compared to schools in the Global North, public schools in rural Bolivia have historically been at
6

the lower end of the educational quality continuum (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2012; Jiménez & Vera,
2010; Punch, 2004). Fluctuations in the supply of educational services (e.g., infrastructure and personnel;
(UDAPE-UNICEF, 2008)) have made providing consistent and high quality education more difficult. One
consequence of this is that Bolivian children between 1st-5th grade are reported to attend ∼50% fewer hours
of school than their American age-matched peers (Rowland, 2014). Among Tsimane specifically, primary
school classes are held five days per week (Mon-Fri) but last only about four hours per day (8am-noon).
Cancellations are common due to rain. Classroom equipment and learning materials are not consistently
available, and while attendance is systematically recorded by teachers, truancy is not penalized (Reyes-
García et al., 2010).
Tsimane children begin attending school sometime between ages 5-7 years (mean±SD in the present
sample = 6.4±2.2 years). FS is usually children's first exposure to the written alphabet and counting be-
yond small numbers describing surroundings (e.g., one capuchin monkey, two stars in the sky). Children's
first language is Tsimane, a linguistic isolate that contains its own words for numbers 1 (yiris) through 7
(yävätidye'); words for numbers 8 through 10 were created in Tsimane by American missionaries in the
1970s, and words for numbers 11 and above are derived from the base 10 system (W. and R. Gill, New
Tribes missionary-linguists, personal communication, 2001). Tsimane children become familiar with the
Arabic numeral system and the alphabet approximately three years later than children in the US, Canada,
and Europe (Piantadosi et al., 2014). Delays of a similar magnitude have also been observed among low-SES
groups within high-income countries (Jordan et al., 2009).
2.3. Participants
Study participants and their families were already participating in the Tsimane Health and Life History
Project (THLHP; Gurven et al. 2017). Villages were chosen based on whether or not Bolivia's educational
reforms had been implemented in the village school between 2006 and 2007. We also intentionally included
villages with high, medium, and low quality schools with variable access to the market town; prior studies
have indicated that aspects of urban market environments may affect cognitive performance independently
of individual differences (Tine 2014; see Supplemental for further details). We avoided potential selection
biases made by parents by excluding families who moved to communities with operating schools within 15
years of the study.
The study baseline sample (time-1; Table S1) includes 290 children (aged 8-18 years; 42% female) tested
in RCPM, and for whom we collected data on school-derived skills, weight-for-height, school attendance,
7

parental education, family wealth, and travel distances to the village school and market town of San Borja.
Sampling involved matching participants by age and sex across school quality subsets in six villages using
the THLHP census and school records. All study procedures were approved by the Tsimane Government
(Gran Consejo Tsimane) and the protocol and design were approved by the IRB at the University of New
Mexico.
We first classified villages as having high (n=2), medium (n=2), or low (n=2) quality schools (see below
for methods on classification of school quality) to test whether exposure to higher quality FS is associated
with higher RCPM score (P1). Children were tested on RCPM individually and in private. We found no
evidence of a "contamination effect" on RCPM score: children who were tested later scored slightly lower
than children tested earlier (e.g.,βTestOrder = 0.06, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.01, controlling for age and sex,
village as a random effect).
After initial (study baseline) testing (time-1) we conducted follow-up assessments both one year (time-
2) and three years after time-1 (time-3). During each follow-up, school-derived skills were tested, and
school quality was reassessed because school quality frequently varies over time (Jiménez & Lizárraga,
2003; Winters, 2019). Attendance was only collected at time-1 and time-2. Weight-for-height data were
collected by the THLHP one to two times each year during the study, and thus these data exist at each time
point. The longitudinal analysis included 184 children and excluded children who matriculated during the
four-year period. Thus, all 184 students were 12 or younger at time-1. To account for potential self-selection
resulting from children leaving school (e.g., from pregnancy, incompatible domestic work requirements),
in villages with consistent FS, only children who were in school over the entire four year testing period
were included in longitudinal analyses. Children dropped out of high, medium, and low quality schools at
approximately the same rate. School quality assessment
To determine school quality, data were collected on 11 items in each school before initial testing (time-1),
and abbreviated assessments (see i-iv below) were conducted at times 2 and 3. The characteristics measured
were largely informed by recommendations from the National Center of Education Statistics (Mayer et al.,
2000), but they were adapted to local needs (e.g., presence of desks, walls on classroom or school building).
These 11 items were reexamined against updated recommendations for international school assessments
(Singer & Braun, 2018). Items indicating school quality combined continuous, ordinal and binary coded
items. Continuous items included: (i) number of months a school was in session during the last calendar
year (assessed through student attendance records maintained by the teacher when available); (ii) percentage
of teachers who reported having government certification; (iii) teacher:student ratio per class (based on
8

teachers' class rosters), averaged across all classes in a school; (iv) number of classrooms in the school;
and, (v) travel distance (in km) from the community to the market town of San Borja. Ordinal items were
coded on a four-point scale (range: 0=never/none - 3=often/many) and included: (vi) books available in
classrooms; (vii) number of students with access to classroom equipment (i.e., chairs/benches, desks/tables);
and (viii) whether students were following teacher's instructions during unannounced visits. Binary (1=yes,
0=no) items included: (ix) Are basic writing materials (i.e., paper and pencils) provided to students by
the school? (x) Does/do the school/classrooms have walls (i.e., to limit distractions)? (xi) Are schools
permanent, concrete structures?
A composite school quality measure during initial RCPM testing was derived from the first factor from
a principal components analysis (PCA) of the 11 school quality items (93% variance explained). We did not
rely on data transformation methods and ordinal variables were entered directly into the PCA (Kolenikov &
Angeles, 2009). Following Menon et al. (2000), variables with factor loadings of <0.06 were excluded (i.e.
village distance to San Borja). The composite measure was then divided into terciles indicting low, medium,
and high school quality (Table S4). The PCA-derived school quality categories corresponded to subjective
rankings by HED, JS and MDG.
2.4. Psychometric testing
Measuring abstract reasoning in cross-cultural settings using instruments derived from populations that
are accustomed to testing poses methodological challenges (Greenfield, 1997; Hruschka et al., 2018). To
minimize potential obstacles arising from linguistic differences and illiteracy, we employed a nonverbal
cognitive test designed without culturally loaded references, Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM)
(Raven, 2011). In constructing Raven's Matrices (Colored, Progressive, and Advanced) , Raven's intention
was to assess participants' abstract reasoning ability (Raven, 1998). Performance assessments are themselves
culturally specific, but RCPM, in particular, has been widely used cross-culturally (Wongupparaj et al., 2015)
due, in large part, to its limited reliance on language or literacy. RCPM is considered well-suited for children
aged 5-11 years, with children generally developing the skills required to score perfectly (i.e., 36/36; though
here we report normalized scores) by adolescence (Raven, 2000). But variation in FS (Vygotsky, 1980) and
other local factors (e.g., salience of stimuli, experience with testing, nutritional status, learning environment)
may affect performance and the timing of cognitive skill development (Cole, 1997; Sternberg, 2000)
A trained bilingual (Spanish-Tsimane) research assistant introduced the test to participants in the native
Tsimane language. To reduce potential stress or anxiety associated with a novel testing situation, RCPM
9

was described to children as a puzzle rather than a test. Participants were then asked to examine 36 different
patterns, and for each one, point to one of six pieces that fit into the missing pattern space. There is no
time limit on the test, and children were told they could take as long as they wished to complete the task
and to try their best. Seven children did not finish the test. Mean±SD RCPM completion time was 26±10
minutes (min-max: 7.2 to 44.0 minutes). After completing the task each participant was compensated with
the same items, regardless of their RCPM score, i.e., school supplies and fishing line and fishing hooks, or
cooking items. These items were requested as compensation by communities, and children were able to
choose which items they preferred.
2.5. Educational assessments and school attendance
Grade levels were recorded but may not be strictly comparable across communities (e.g., children in low
quality schools could advance to higher grades but have lower levels of academic achievement). Therefore,
all study participants were given brief arithmetic and reading assessments to independently evaluate school-
derived skills. Questions for the reading assessment were derived from the Iowa Test of Basic Skills—Grade
3 (Hoover et al., 2003). The reading assessment was scored on a Likert scale from 0-5 to assess literacy and
reading comprehension. Children were asked by the research assistant to read a short story consisting of
three sentences to assess literacy and then were asked a follow-up comprehension question. The arithmetic
assessment was scored based on the number of correct responses to three arithmetic problems varying in
difficulty (e.g., 5+3, 21-11, and 6x5). Data on school attendance (range: 30-60 days in school, immediately
prior to the study) were obtained from teachers who systematically recorded attendance. These records
were compared for consistency against a risk set of attendance collected during the school-based abilities
assessment and through visual confirmation while classes were in session during the study period (∼10
school days).
2.6. Parent education, family wealth, and distance
Family interviews included questions on parents' educational background.
These data were cross-
checked and supplemented with demographic and educational data collected previously by THLHP. Dis-
tances from residential household to school, and to town, were calculated using GPS points collected by the
THLHP.
10

2.7. Statistical analysis
Abstract reasoning (RCPM) score was non-normally distributed and characterized by sub-groups of
unequal size. We, therefore, relied on a gamma error distribution with log link in generalized linear models
(GLMs). For ease of comparison across variables we used feature scaling (min-max normalization), which
rescales values between 0 and 1. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to select the best-fit model
(P1-P2). Results were considered statistically significant at the 5% significance level.
Because we have a small number of clusters in our sample (i.e., villages and school quality) there is a
possibility that the error terms in our regression models are not robust to heteroskedasticity or correlations
within clusters during initial (time-1) analyses. Following Roodman et al. (2019) and MacKinnon and
Webb (2017), we performed wild cluster bootstrapping tests as a post-estimation procedure. The confidence
intervals and p-values derived from this procedure are included at the bottom of Table 1 and confirm our
model results (see Supplemental for further details on robustness checks with wild cluster bootstrapping).
To allow for potential causal interpretations in the longitudinal study, we first determined that there were
no significant sociodemographic differences between the villages prior to the implementation of Morales'
new schooling policies (see introduction for additional details). Further, after testing for multicollinearity,
we found that shorter travel times to the market town (expressed in hours) did not associate with an increase
in the odds of attending a higher quality school (OR = 0.99, p = 0.82, 95% CI: -0.86, 1.10, null hypothesis:
coefficient = 1.0). Likewise, the odds of having a higher quality school in one's village did not significantly
increase with greater family wealth (OR = 1.00, p = 0.15, 95% CI: -1.00, 1.00), more years of maternal (OR
= 1.16, p = 0.06, 95% CI: -1.00, 1.36) or paternal schooling (OR = 1.17, p = 0.13, 95% CI: -0.98, 1.42), or
higher child nutritional status (OR = 0.79, p = 0.17, 95% CI: -0.55, 1.11, McFadden's R2 = 0.09).
Robustness checks (wild cluster bootstrap) were performed during analyses of initial RCPM testing. We
defined treatment at the village level. We used a binary treatment variable, which is equal to 1 if a high
quality school was installed in the village. All households in a given village with a high quality school
were categorized as treated during initial testing (time-1); however, our other regression models at time-1
did include child- and family- level predictors to account for intra-cluster differences. Our school quality
treatment at the village level had a small number of clusters with an unbalanced sample, which ruled out
inference based on conventional or robust clustered standard errors (Cameron et al., 2008; Webb, 2013).
Therefore, following Webb (2014), we used a multi-point wild cluster bootstrap, which randomly draws
probability weights from a normal distribution (M = 0, SD = 1) in order to check whether our results held.
Because schooling effects should accumulate over time, and because resource and teacher availability fluc-
11

tuated over the study period, we did consider school quality a time-varying covariate in our longitudinal
analyses (see Latent Growth Model details below and in supplemental).
Finally, to model individual change in RCPM score over time (P3), we employ a latent growth curve
model (LGCM) (Little, 2013), which allows flexibility for factor loadings associated with the slope factor
to fit both linear and nonlinear growth trajectories for each individual over time. Because our data were not
normally distributed, we rely on the Satorra-Bentler test statistic in place of a traditional ML chi-squared test
(see Supplemental for further details). Model comparison of fit indices identified an unconstrained model
as best fit. This model allowed the intercept and the factor loadings associated with the slope to vary for
individuals over time. Additional model details for the LGCM can be found in Supplemental Methods.
Analyses were performed in R 3.6.2. A moderated mediation model and latent growth curve analysis
were conducted in the lavaan package for R (Rosseel, 2012). All models adjusted for age and sex.
2.8. Missing Data
Sample sizes for RCPM scores vary across the three time points (time-1=290, time-2=130, and time-
3=154). We therefore examined potential differences in communities with complete and incomplete data
across time. Across all levels of schooling, descriptive statistics were stable, indicating that group variable
balance was robust to attrition at time-1. For example, rates of attrition after four years were 47%, 46% and
44% for children in high, medium, and low quality schools, respectively.
Our data did not warrant dropping missing cases, nor was overall missingness of the dataset considered
too large to test our hypotheses at >40% (Jakobsen et al., 2017). Some participants were unavailable during
longitudinal follow-up at one or more data-collection periods. Overall, we had a combined 19.5% missing-
ness in RCPM and 24% missing reading scores across all time points. These data were classified as Missing
at Random (MAR), and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) from the MICE package in R (Buuren
& Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2010) was used to impute these missing values.
3. Results
RCPM scores are similar for boys and girls (Mann-Whitney U, z = -0.82, p = 0.15). Reading and
arithmetic ability varied by school quality: 88% of children in villages with low quality schools are illiterate
vs. 65% and 57% of children in villages with medium and high quality schools, respectively (Table S2).
Arithmetic ability shows a similar pattern. Only 8% of children in low quality schools correctly answer
all three arithmetic questions vs. 25% of children in medium quality schools, and 30% of children in high

quality schools. Children in higher quality schools demonstrate arithmetic proficiency (answering all three
questions correctly) approximately two years earlier (mean age±SD=11.8 ± 2.9) than children in low quality
schools (mean age±SD=13.6 ± 4.6).
3.1. Initial RCPM scores are associated with higher school quality (P1a), and children attending higher
quality schools show greater age-related RCPM performance (P1b)
RCPM scores are higher for children attending higher vs. low quality schools (βHigher(vs.Low) = 0.26, p <
0.001, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.41; Table 1: Model 1) but scores do not differ among children attending medium vs.
low quality schools (βMedium(vs.Low) = 0.10, p = 0.69, 95% CI: -0.06, 0.27). Compared to children attending
low quality schools, greater age-related RCPM score are observed among children attending both higher
(βAge∗HighQuality = 1.18, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.71) and medium (βAge∗MediumQuality = 1.17, p < 0.001,
95% CI: 0.56, 1.77) quality schools (Figure 1; Table 1: Model 2).

3.2. Reading ability partially mediates the effect of school attendance on RCPM score, while school quality
moderates the effect of school attendance and reading ability on RCPM score during initial testing (P2)
We first model time-1 RCPM score as a function of child-level factors and then family-level factors,
while adjusting for school quality, age and sex. We then explore pathways by which different factors exert
direct and indirect effects on RCPM score by employing moderated mediation analysis.
In the child-level model (Table S3: Model 1; Figure 2), reading ability is positively associated with
RCPM score for children in high and medium (vs. low) quality schools (βHighQuality∗Reading = 1.06, p =
0.002, 95% CI: 0.39, 1.70; βMediumQuality∗Reading = 0.80, p = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.04, 1.55; Figure S1). There
is also a positive, marginal association between school attendance and RCPM score (βAttendance = 0.19, p
= 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.40). Neither arithmetic ability nor weight-for-height predict RCPM score in this
model. Because 83% of participants had at least one co-resident sibling who also participated, we considered
an additional adjustment for shared family environment. A generalized linear mixed model (specifying main
effects only) that included a random term for family ID reveals similar parameter estimates as our first model
(see Figure 2 and Table S3), and poor reliability (conditional ICC = 0.28). Thus, only results from the GLM
are reported.
In the family-level model, RCPM score is lower among those living farther from school (βDistance = -0.59,
p < 0.001, 95% CI: -0.85, -0.32) and is positively, albeit marginally, associated with maternal schooling
(βMother = 0.36, p = 0.06, 95% CI: -0.01, 0.74; Figure 2; Table S3: Model 2).
15

Figure 2: Effect sizes for school quality and child-level factors (left), school quality and family-level factors (center), and the best-fit model (right) on variation in initial RCPM
score were calculated with generalized linear models using AIC criterion. Variance inflation factors for main effects range from 1.21-1.52 for covariates in the child-level
model and from 1.01-1.30 in the family-level model. Data are normalized to facilitate comparability but are not mean centered (see Methods for further details). Significant
variables (p ≤0.05)areindicatedbyblackcircles.RefertoTableS3 forparameterestimates
16

School quality remains a positive predictor in this model in both high and medium (vs. low) quality
schools ((βHigh(vs.Low) = 0.64, p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.90; βMedium(vs.Low) = 0.48, p = 0.002, 95% CI:
0.17, 0.79, respectively). There are no significant interactions between school quality and either ¬parental
schooling, travel distance to school, or family wealth on RCPM score.
The best-fit model of RCPM score based on AIC and adjusted D-squared explains 44% of the variance in
the initial (time-1) RCPM score. It includes interactions between school quality (high vs. low) and both read-
ing ability (βHighQuality∗Reading = 0.93, p = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.58) and attendance (βHighQuality∗Attendance
= 0.40, p = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.78). There is also a significant effect of reading ability on RCPM score
in medium (vs. low) quality schools (βMediumQuality∗Reading = 0.81, p = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.05, 1.56). The as-
sociation between attendance and RCPM score is also greater for children in higher vs. low quality schools
(Figures 2; Table S3: Model 3).
Because our predictions focus on understanding why and under what conditions child- and family-, and
community-level predictors relate to RCPM performance, we next employ a moderated mediation analysis.
This combined model allows for the simultaneous investigation of the direct and conditional indirect effects
of school quality, as well as the other predictors of initial RCPM score identified in the best-fit model, on
children's RCPM performance (Figure S2). We find that school attendance has both direct and indirect
effects on RCPM score, while reading ability partially mediates the effect of attendance on RCPM score
(Table 2). We then estimate the effects of school quality, reading ability, and attendance (Figure S2). School
quality moderates both the indirect effect of attendance (Attendance ⇒Reading ability ⇒RCPM score), the
direct effect of attendance, and the direct effect of reading ability on RCPM score, suggesting that children
who attend school frequently in high quality schools gain more from their scholastic experience than children
with the same attendance and reading levels in lower quality schools. We do not find a moderating effect of
school quality on the relation between school attendance and reading ability, indicating that increased school
attendance improves reading ability across all levels of school quality (Figure S3; Table 2). However, both
attendance and reading have the strongest effect on RCPM score for children in high quality schools (Figure
S3; Table2). Overall, the moderated mediation model of conditional direct and indirect effects shows that
school quality significantly moderates effects of school attendance and reading ability (IMM = 0.03, 95%
CI: -0.01, 0.05; Figure 3) and explains 49.3% of the variance in initial RCPM score.

Figure 3: Interactions and simple slopes for moderated mediation analysis of (left) school quality on school attendance and RCPM
score, and (right) school quality on reading ability and RCPM score. The strongest association between attendance and RCPM score
occurred for children in high quality schools. There was a very weak positive association between attendance for children who attended
low quality schools. Children in high quality schools exhibited a strong association between reading ability and RCPM score. Children
in medium quality schools showed a strong association, but not as strong as those in high quality schools. There was a weak association
between reading ability and RCPM score for children in low quality schools.
3.3. School quality moderates effects of individual-level factors on RCPM score longitudinally (P3)
To assess change in RCPM score prospectively, we reassessed school quality and retested children who
participated at initial (time-1), one year later (time-2) and four years later (time-3). Though there was not a
substantial change in school quality over time, teacher retention and available school resources did fluctuate.
Therefore, in addition to reading ability and weight-for-height, school quality is entered as a time varying
predictor in the LGCM. Children in high quality schools show the greatest mean increase (47%) in RCPM
score over time, compared to a mean increase of 31% for children in medium quality schools and a mean
decrease of 2% for children in low quality schools (Figure 4). RCPM scores remain significantly lower
among children in medium vs. high quality schools (βMedium(vs.High) = -0.64, p = 0.01, 95% CI: -1.16,
-0.12). In contrast to what we reported for initial RCPM scores, longitudinal change in RCPM score is
19

marginally greater for children in medium vs. low quality schools (βMedium(vs.Low) = 0.56, p = 0.09, 95% CI:
-0.68, 1.18; controlling for age).
Figure 4: Intra-individual change over time in RCPM score in low, medium, and high quality schools (n = 184 children). RCPM score
is normalized (range: 0-1). Time 1 represents initial score, Time 2 is the score taken a year later, and Time 3 is the score taken three
years after the first test. Children who were initially included in the longitudinal study design (see Methods for details) but did not
remain in school during the entire study period (n = 21) are omitted in the final analysis.
To model longitudinal change in RCPM scores while allowing for non-linear trajectories and time-
varying covariates, we employ a Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM) at three time points. All variables
from the child-level model (P4) are included in the initial LGCM (Table S3; Figure 2). Only school quality,
reading ability, and children's weight-for-height positively predict prospective change in RCPM score (Table
3). It is possible that students who dropped out of school before follow-up may have underperformed, so to
account for this potential endogeneity, which could inflate positive correlations between school quality and
increase in RCPM score over time, we excluded any children that left school (i.e., dropped out, aged out
during the study period (n = 21; >90% left school to help at home, earn wages, or because of pregnancy),
and we confirmed that dropout rates were approximately equal across quality of schools (∼45%). Children
20

whose families moved to other villages during the study period were included in this analysis, provided they
were still in school (n=2). Age is not predictive of change in RCPM score over time (Table 3). School
quality interacts with reading ability and weight-for-height to affect RCPM scores over time; the interaction
effect of school quality and reading ability is three times greater at Time 3 than Time 2.

4. Discussion
We find that consistent quality schooling shows a strong association with performance in a task designed
to capture abstract reasoning (RCPM). Children in high quality schools show higher RCPM score at study
baseline than children in low quality schools, as early as age 9, which is just two years after children typically
begin attending school (Figure. 1). Corroborating the cross-sectional analyses at study baseline, we found
prospectively that RCPM scores improved most in higher quality schools, and that well-nourished and more
literate students differentially prosper in higher quality school settings.
As reported in previous studies in post-industrialized populations (Ceci, 1991; Ritchie et al., 2015; Stern-
berg et al., 2001), we also find that among Tsimane children, proficiency in arithmetic and reading abilities
(Figure 2, Table S3) are associated with greater RCPM score. A greater proportion of children in higher qual-
ity schools demonstrate greater proficiency in arithmetic and reading abilities, and at earlier ages, compared
to peers in low quality schools.
4.1. What are children learning in higher quality schools that might affect observed differences?
It is well recognized that schooling reinforces rule adherence and task completion, emphasizes goal set-
ting, and rewards academic achievement (Dasen et al., 2004; Heyneman & Loxley, 1983). School quality
should thus amplify effects of attendance or literacy on abstract reasoning. Our findings support these expec-
tations: children who demonstrated greater reading ability and who attended higher quality schools scored
higher on both initial and prospective increase in RCPM (see Figure 2, Table S3), suggesting that abstract
reasoning may not only be a byproduct of minimal FS exposure (Sternberg et al., 2001), but improves more
in high quality schools. This study among Tsimane children demonstrates that small improvements in school
quality at the lower end of the educational continuum have considerable impact of abstract reasoning skills.
4.2. Cultural institutions, school quality, and human capital inequality
Altogether, evidence from the Tsimane suggests that early childhood learning environments that children
are exposed to when growing up, play a crucial role in the development of abstract reasoning skills. Any
goal to reduce educational and economic inequality requires ensuring higher rates of return on children's
time in school, especially if school quality promotes skills needed in labor market economies (Hanushek &
Woessmann, 2008; Heckman & Kautz, 2012). The moderating effect of school quality on attendance and
reading ability in our study (Figure 3) and the dosage-response effect of school quality over time (Figure 4)
suggests greater returns on time invested in high quality schools in populations with recent exposure to FS.
22

Students may have perfect attendance and attain basic competencies yet still perform poorly on cognitive
tasks if living in areas where the schools are lower in quality. If abstract reasoning reflects a type of skill
increasingly rewarded in transitioning economies like the Tsimane are experiencing in Bolivia, where cash
cropping, small business creation, extraction industries, NGOs and other new opportunities are becoming
more available, then differential exposure to quality schooling will affect who can successfully navigate
these new prospects. Our longitudinal model further indicate that the effect that number of years in school
has on abstract reasoning ability is heavily dependent on school quality. Thus, to adequately assess causal
mechanisms underlying reasoning ability, researchers must do more than rely on measuring years in school
and certain child-level abilities.
More broadly, however, we must also consider that FS likely improves some cognitive abilities while
eroding others. Just as family and labor commitments impose costs on children's time and success in school
(Heady, 2003), earlier work among the Tsimane has demonstrated that learning school-based skills comes at
the cost of other competencies often necessary for productive livelihoods in subsistence economies (Reyes-
García et al., 2010).
4.3. Limitations
One major limitation is that instrument of focus in this paper, RCPM, is an etic (WEIRD) assessment of
abstract reasoning or fluid ability. However, as this study demonstrates, RCPM does tap into the kinds of
skills rewarded in transitional economies, suggesting that FS, and in particular higher quality FS, is helping
to improve those "abilities" for populations in transition. Because we only collected data among school aged
children, our study does not address effects of earlier childhood experiences on the development of abstract
reasoning (Nonoyama-Tarumi & Ota, 2011), nor do we address the persistence of abstract reasoning skills
once children leave school. More studies of school-derived skills other than reading and arithmetic are
needed to understand effects of school quality on development of academic skills and abstract reasoning.
Given this limitation, any effects of FS that are independent of reading and arithmetic may be interpreted
as supporting non-cognitive skills, such as perseverance, conscientiousness, and motivation. But we did not
assess or measure these non-cognitive skills, nor did we assess any village differences in school rules or
expectations.
23

5. Conclusion
Though educational inequality creates barriers to human capital accumulation and potential income
growth in a competitive labor market economy (Feinstein, 2003), there has been little consensus on the
magnitude of the effect that cultural institutions, such as FS, have on shaping cognition during childhood.
Our findings show that among populations recently introduced to FS, abstract reasoning is cultivated through
higher quality schooling, and that access to quality schools has a cumulative effect on children's abstract rea-
soning abilities. Among the numerous studies evaluating cognitive performance (see Ritchie & Tucker-Drob
2018), many maintain certain cognitive skills, such as abstract reasoning, are a reliable measure of innate
cognitive abilities, demonstrate a universal maturational trend, and are predictive of life outcomes. Our find-
ings suggest instead that some of the cognitive skills (and the tests that attempt to measure them) used to
establish milestones of children's healthy cognitive development (Nisbett, 2009) may simply be a product
of a cumulative culture, where Western FS has changed what and how children learn (Davis et al., 2021b;
Muthukrishna et al., 2018).

Amazon demonstrates that higher school quality augments differences in children's abstract 
reasoning. 
 
 
Methods 
 
Sociodemographic details: Information on the child's age, parents' education and wealth, and 
residence history were previously collected. These data were cross-checked and updated through 
family-level interviews around the time of testing. Families that had recently moved to a study village 
with an established school or closer to the market town within the previous 10 years were excluded 
from our sample to rule out any selection effects among families migrating specifically for the 
educational opportunities available in study villages. 
Latent Growth Model: Latent growth models (LGMs) were used to capture longitudinal 
change in RCPM score by estimating a growth trajectory for each subject in the sample, characterized 
by a starting point (intercept factor) and the rate of change over time (slope or growth factor). Initial 
evaluations of unconditional LGMs (without covariates) yield the fixed effects of growth (mean value 
of the intercept and slope factors) and the random effects (variance of the intercept and slope factors) 
to reflect individual variability at the starting point and rate of change over time (for an overview, see 
Bollen and Curran, 2006). Growth models in the current study were estimated using the lavaan 
package for R. We first estimated intercorrelations of RCPM scores over time by school quality 
(Table S4). We then assessed separate unconditional LGMs of RCPM score over time with time- 
invariant and time-varying covariates (taken from child-level factors in P4). To control for possible 
confounds associated with universal maturation processes, significant associations identified in other 
studies using RCPM (Cotton et al., 2005), and to increase degrees of freedom, age was entered as a 
time invariant covariate for each analysis (M=10.62 years SD=1.68 years). All models were evaluated 
through the following indices: the Satorra-Bentler test statistic (SBχ2), which was used in place of a 
traditional Maximum Likelihood chi-squared test (Wu et al., 2009), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), 

and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The best-fit model (Table 3) met the 
minimum criteria for all goodness-of-fit indices: N = 184; CFI = 0.91; SBχ2 (14) = 38.67, p = 0.95; 
RMSEA = 0.02. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
 
Confounds and causality 
 
Despite relative SES homogeneity in our study population, the causal connection between 
school quality and cognition can be obscured by endogenous factors (Deary & Johnson, 2010). 
Researchers must contend with families relocating to communities or neighborhoods that provide 
greater access to high quality schools. However, at the time of this study, the primary reason 
individuals reported relocating to another community was due to marriage. Tsimane typically have 
matrilocal residence patterns upon marriage, until at least the first child is born, after which patrilocal 
residence is the norm. In our sample, only two families moved to study communities with operating 
schools within 10 years prior to baseline data collection (and we excluded from analyses children 
from these families). Moreover, although family- and community-level characteristics often predict 
attendance, school-based abilities, and cognitive performance (Aikens & Barbarin, 2008; Mani et al., 
2013; Tong et al., 2007), we did not find significant effects of parental education or residential 
proximity to school on children's RCPM scores in best-fit models. However, given the relatively 
limited variability in wealth, adult education, and nutritional status, it is noteworthy that in the family- 
level model (P2), both mother's education and residential proximity to school (range: ~0.07 km- 
3.5km) are associated with RCPM score (Figure 2). This underscores how, even with limited 
variation in parental and population level characteristics, maternal education and easier access to 
school can still influence children's cognitive task performance. Individual characteristics and self- 
selection for particular learning environments play a significant role in children's academic 
achievement and test performance (Figlio et al., 2017; Smith-Woolley et al., 2018). Increased 
attendance could, in turn, reinforce the hard and non-cognitive skills necessary for academic 

achievement and cognitive testing (Coutinho, 2007; Heckman & Kautz, 2012). We find that, 
regardless of school quality, children who attend school more frequently demonstrate higher reading 
ability. However, children were more likely to consistently attend school if their school was higher 
quality (Figure 3), and the highest proportion of children with high reading ability and RCPM scores 
were in villages with higher quality schools (Figure 3 and S2-3) Higher quality schools may thus be 
better able to support learning for children with a wider range of abilities (Heyneman & Loxley, 
1983).

on the right depicts baseline RCPM scores by school quality. RCPM score and reading ability 
are normalized for ease of comparison. 

Fig. S2. 
 
Hypothesized model showing the direct and conditional indirect effects on RCPM score. 
Reading ability is proposed to mediate the effect of school attendance on RCPM score. School 
quality moderation is predicted to effect reading ability via school attendance, and effect 
RCPM score via reading comprehension and attendance. Dotted lines indicates effects that 
were not included in the final model. 

Fig. S3. 
 
 
 
 
Moderated mediation model showing the mediating effect of reading ability and the 
moderating effect of school quality on RCPM score via school attendance and reading ability. 
Higher attendance has a direct effect on reading ability. The direct effect of reading ability on 
RCPM score is moderated by school quality as illustrated by the interaction effect between 
school quality and reading ability; children attending higher quality schools score higher on 
RCPM at all reading levels. The effect of school attendance on RCPM score is also moderated 
by school quality; children who had at least average attendance in higher quality schools have 
higher RCPM scores vs. children in lower quality schools. Interactions are indicated in 
individual boxes. Path coefficients are standardized. Age is a covariate in the model. Path 
coefficients greater than p = 0.05 are not included. Interaction and conditional indirect effects 
are further described in Table 2. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001
