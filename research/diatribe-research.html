<p>The paper introduces the Backwards Quantum Propagation of Phase
errors (Baqprop) principle, which unifies quantum phase kickback and
classical backpropagation. It proposes two optimization strategies
leveraging Baqprop: Quantum Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum
Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad). QDD simulates quantum coherent
dynamics for parameter optimization, allowing quantum tunneling through
the hypothesis space landscape, while MoMGrad estimates gradients via
quantum measurement to perform gradient descent. The paper also
discusses parallelization methods, regularization techniques,
meta-learning, and applications of Baqprop in training quantum neural
networks for classical and quantum data. Numerical simulations of QDD
and MoMGrad are presented for representative applications.</p>
<p>The text focuses on the theoretical framework of quantum machine
learning, aiming to bridge classical deep learning theory with quantum
computing principles. It introduces continuous and discrete quantum
registers, phase estimation, gradient estimation, and the Quantum
Feedforward and Baqprop (QFB) algorithm for evaluating gradients in
supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios.</p>
<p>Key concepts include: - Baqprop as a unified principle of quantum and
classical backpropagation - QDD as a quantum coherent optimization
method inspired by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
and Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA) - MoMGrad for semi-classical
gradient estimation based on Baqprop - Discussion of hyperparameter
optimization, regularization, parallelization, and meta-learning
techniques inspired by classical deep learning methods - Applications in
quantum neural networks, quantum parametric circuits, state learning,
unitary/channel learning, classification/regression, compression codes,
error correction, generative adversarial networks, and hybrid
quantum-classical networks</p>
<p>Quantum Meta-Learning (QML) is the process of optimizing
hyperparameters in quantum machine learning models using quantum
algorithms. This can help reduce the time required to find a good local
minimum in the parameter space, compared to traditional methods that may
scale exponentially with the number of hyperparameters. In QML, Quantum
Dynamical Descent (QDD) or Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent
(MoMGrad) are employed for this optimization.</p>
<p>The key idea is to view the hyperparameter optimization as another
layer in a quantum neural network, where each set of hyperparameters
corresponds to a different architecture or configuration of the model.
By treating these configurations as quantum states and using quantum
gates to manipulate them, one can use quantum algorithms to efficiently
explore the space of possible hyperparameter settings.</p>
<p>There are several advantages to applying QML: 1. Faster convergence:
QDD or MoMGrad can potentially find a suitable set of hyperparameters
more quickly than classical methods, given their ability to exploit
quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. 2. Scalability:
As the number of hyperparameters increases, classical optimization
techniques often face computational challenges due to exponential growth
in search space. QML can provide a more efficient means of navigating
this space using quantum computing principles. 3. Adaptability: Through
QML, models can learn to adjust their own hyperparameters during
training (online learning), allowing for more robust and adaptive
solutions tailored to specific input data distributions or task
requirements.</p>
<p>In practice, implementing QML involves several steps: 1. Defining the
quantum neural network architecture with variable hyperparameters. 2.
Initializing these hyperparameters as a parameterized quantum state
(e.g., using a Gaussian distribution). 3. Applying Quantum Dynamical
Descent or Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent to update the
hyperparameter state iteratively. 4. Monitoring performance (using a
validation set) and stopping when convergence criteria are met or
computational constraints are reached. 5. Fine-tuning the remaining
layers of the quantum neural network with the optimized
hyperparameters.</p>
<p>While QML shows promise for improving quantum machine learning, it
also presents challenges: 1. Quantum hardware limitations: Current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices have limited qubit counts and
are prone to errors, which impacts the feasibility of QML on real
quantum computers in the short term. 2. Theoretical foundations: There
is a need for further theoretical work to better understand how quantum
algorithms can most effectively navigate hyperparameter spaces,
particularly with regards to convergence guarantees and error bounds. 3.
Interpretability: Hyperparameters are often chosen based on domain
knowledge or heuristics in classical machine learning. In QML, the
learned hyperparameters might be less interpretable compared to their
classical counterparts.</p>
<p>In summary, Quantum Meta-Learning is an emerging field with the
potential to revolutionize how we optimize quantum machine learning
models by leveraging quantum mechanics’ unique properties. Although
challenges remain, ongoing research and development aim to address these
hurdles and unlock the full potential of QML for practical applications
in near-term quantum computing.</p>
<p>The provided text discusses a quantum meta-learning approach for
optimizing both classical neural networks and quantum parametric
circuits using gradient descent methods on quantum hyper-parameters.
This is achieved through the use of quantum backpropagation,
specifically Quantum Feedforward and Phase Kick Backpropagation (QFB),
which does not require analytic derivatives of each computation part.
The approach involves entangling quantum hyper-parameters with network
parameters or compute registers to leverage quantum phase for
optimization.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Hyper-Parameter Optimization</strong>: Classical neural
networks’ hyper-parameters, such as initialization, descent rates, and
architecture, are treated as continuous or discrete quantum parameters.
Quantum Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient
Descent (MoMGrad) are used to optimize these parameters efficiently
without the need for analytic derivatives, using backpropagation of
phases rather than gradients. The use of entanglement between
hyper-parameters and network/compute registers is crucial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum Parametric Circuit Learning</strong>: Quantum
parametric circuits are used to represent a space of candidate unitaries
optimized to minimize a loss function. Traditional hybrid
quantum-classical methods for optimization involve many expectation
value estimations, which can be resource-intensive. The paper suggests
using Baqprop (Backwards Quantum Phase Error Propagation) instead,
allowing for gradient estimation with fewer queries. Parametric quantum
circuits are decomposed into layers of unitaries acting on different
registers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum State Exponentiation</strong>: To implement loss
function exponentials for quantum data, various techniques exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-state exponentiation</strong> uses the
Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost protocol to exponentiate a given state using
multiple copies, scaling as O(η^2/ϵ).</li>
<li><strong>Sequential mini-batching</strong> involves Trotterizing
mixed states into a series of pure state exponentials. This method
requires n ∼O(η^2/ϵ) steps and copies.</li>
<li><strong>QRAM batching</strong> uses Quantum Random Access Memory to
create mixed states from pure states, which are then exponentiated
similarly to single-state exponentiation methods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum State Learning</strong>: This is analogous to
unsupervised learning in classical ML, aiming to approximate the
underlying distribution of quantum data (pure or mixed states) using
parametrized circuits. Pure state learning uses QFB with MoMGrad or QDD,
leveraging multiple copies of the target state for exponential
computation. Mixed state learning can follow from pure state learning
results, or by exploiting access to pure state samples from the
distribution through a similar QFB optimization process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, this text outlines an approach combining quantum computing
with machine learning principles to optimize both classical and quantum
models efficiently using backpropagation techniques adapted for quantum
systems.</p>
<p>The paper discusses potential near-term implementations for various
quantum machine learning algorithms on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum
(NISQ) devices, emphasizing that low-depth quantum circuits relying
solely on expectation values of simple observables tend to be more
robust against noise. The authors speculate that the following
optimization protocols have a better chance of near-term
implementation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad):</strong>
This algorithm uses measurement outcomes for gradient calculation,
potentially reducing circuit depth overhead at the cost of higher space
overhead. It may be more robust to noise due to its reliance on
expectation values.</li>
<li><strong>Quantum Dynamical Descent (QDD):</strong> Similar to
MoMGrad, QDD depends on expectation values and has a lower-depth quantum
circuit. Its kinetic pulse could potentially help mitigate the effects
of noise by adjusting the parametric transformations.</li>
<li><strong>Coherent Accumulation of Momenta Parallelization (CAMP) for
Hamiltonian optimization:</strong> This method parallelizes the
accumulation of momenta, reducing depth overhead while increasing space
overhead. It could be more resilient to noise given its expectation
value-based approach.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Quantum Neural-Circuit Networks:</strong> Training
classical neural networks in conjunction with quantum parametric
circuits might benefit from NISQ devices due to their ability to handle
classical and quantum computations simultaneously. While more complex,
this approach can leverage the advantages of both realms for enhanced
learning capabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>For practical implementations, it is essential to consider error
mitigation strategies and adaptive algorithms that can adjust to
changing noise conditions on NISQ devices. The robustness of these
proposed methods relies largely on their reliance on expectation values,
which are generally more stable under noise than other quantum
measurements or complex operations.</p>

<p>The provided text discusses the potential of Quantum Machine Learning
(QML) and its optimization techniques for near-term implementation on
quantum computers. The focus is on a protocol called MoMGrad due to its
lower circuit depth requirements, making it suitable for execution on
current near-term devices.</p>
<p>Key points include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Quantum Parameter Registers</strong>: The text discusses
different approaches for implementing quantum parameters. These range
from using single qubits (qudits) to continuous variable (CV) quantum
modes or ‘qumodes’. Qudits, formed by higher-dimensional quantum states
of a qubit, offer some advantages but can be susceptible to underflow
and overflow errors. CV modes, on the other hand, provide robustness
against phase or position perturbations due to their inherent
characteristics as quantum harmonic oscillators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gradient Estimation</strong>: The exponential of the loss
function in MoMGrad adds minimal depth for simple loss functions but can
be more challenging for non-commutative terms in Hamiltonians.
Techniques such as Gradient Expectation Estimation (GEEP) can mitigate
this issue by splitting gradient computation across multiple runs,
enabling parallelization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum Feedforward and Baqprop</strong>: These
techniques are discussed in the context of quantum circuit optimization.
MoMGrad’s circuit depth roughly equals twice that of the original ansatz
plus additional depth from the loss function exponential. For low-depth
circuits, like those used for quantum classifiers, this overhead remains
minimal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Near-Term Implementable Applications</strong>: The text
identifies several promising applications for near-term devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum Classification and Regression: These applications have
simple cost functions that can be exponentiated with straightforward
exponentials of standard basis observables, making them implementable
despite the current limitations in hardware.</li>
<li>Quantum-Classical Hybrid Neural-Circuit Hybrids: By integrating
classical neural processing after quantum parametric circuits, one might
reduce the depth required for achieving transformations or learning
tasks, with feedforward relying on simple expectation values of basic
observables, thus being robust to noise.</li>
<li>Hamiltonian Optimization (Variational Quantum Eigensolver and
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm): These methods can leverage
Baqprop for efficient gradient accumulation even when dealing with
non-commutative terms in the Hamiltonian through techniques like
GEEP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Future Work</strong>: The paper outlines several avenues
for future exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed Analysis of Resource Overheads: Develop tools and methods
from quantum simulation theory to address the overhead challenges
associated with synthesizing gate sequences for QML protocols.</li>
<li>Eﬀective Open System Dynamics Analysis: Extend analysis beyond
first-order kicking rates to better understand the evolution of quantum
parameter states under repeated interactions (kicks) with an
environment, akin to backpropagation in classical networks.</li>
<li>Design of New Parametric Ansatz: Given the prevalence of vanishing
gradients in current quantum parametric ansatze due to their exponential
scaling with degrees of freedom, there’s a need for new designs that can
overcome this limitation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text emphasizes the practical aspects and potential
of QML using MoMGrad on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the
importance of robust parameter representations (qubits, qudits, or
qumodes) and efficient gradient estimation techniques. It also suggests
several directions for future research to enhance the feasibility and

<p>Title: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) - A New Class of Quantum
Neural Network Ansatz</p>
<p>The paper introduces Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN), a novel
class of quantum neural network architectures tailored to represent
quantum processes that have a graph structure. QGNNs are particularly
suitable for distributed quantum systems over a quantum network, and the
authors present specialized architectures like Quantum Graph Recurrent
Neural Networks (QGRNN) and Quantum Graph Convolutional Neural Networks
(QGCNN).</p>
<p>The paper describes four potential applications of QGNNs: 1. Learning
Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum systems: Demonstrated using a Quantum
Graph Recurrent Neural Network (QGRNN), which successfully learns
effective dynamics of an Ising spin system given access to the output of
quantum dynamics at various times. 2. Creating multipartite entanglement
in a quantum network: QGNNs can optimize the preparation of GHZ states
in quantum sensor networks, improving sensitivity through phase kickback
testing. 3. Unsupervised learning for spectral clustering: The Quantum
Spectral Graph Convolutional Neural Network (QSGCNN) is introduced as an
analogue to classical spectral-based graph convolutions using a hybrid
approach combining Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantum transformations. 4.
Supervised learning for graph isomorphism classification: QGNNs can
distinguish between isomorphic graphs by comparing their energetic
measurements, achieving high accuracy even with low sample sizes.</p>
<p>Key contributions: 1. Introducing Quantum Graph Neural Networks
(QGNN) as a new class of quantum neural network architectures tailored
for graph-structured quantum processes and suitable for distributed
quantum systems over a quantum network. 2. Presenting specialized QGNN
variants like QGRNN and QGCNN, along with their applications in various
domains. 3. Demonstrating that QGNNs can efficiently learn Hamiltonian
dynamics, prepare entangled states, perform unsupervised spectral
clustering, and classify graph isomorphism through numerical experiments
using a custom interface between Google’s Cirq and TensorFlow.</p>
<p>The paper lays the groundwork for future research in hybrid methods
combining QGNNs with quantum chemistry processes, generalizing QGNNs to
include edge degrees of freedom, and extending QSGCNN to multiple

<p>The text by Geoffrey Miller discusses the evolution of consciousness
from an evolutionary psychology perspective, focusing on its development
through sexual selection. Here’s a detailed summary with
explanations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Love Poetry vs Zombies</strong>: Philosophers often
describe conscious experiences in romantic terms to either argue against
the plausibility of natural selection explaining human consciousness or
to attract mates, highlighting the intertwining of subjective
experiences and sexual selection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Psychology and Consciousness</strong>:
Miller suggests that evolutionary psychology could potentially explain
human consciousness by examining how it might have evolved to improve
survival or reproductive prospects, particularly during
courtship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objective vs Subjective Consciousness</strong>: Objective
consciousness refers to observable aspects like being awake or able to
articulate thoughts and feelings, which are seen as technical problems
solvable through cognitive neuroscience and AI. In contrast, subjective
consciousness includes private experiences and qualia, posing a puzzle
for scientific explanation due to their seemingly arbitrary
nature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Zombie Argument</strong>: The possibility of
“zombies” – individuals identical to humans in every respect except
lacking subjective experience – challenges the notion that evolutionary
pressures could have favored human-like consciousness without
subjectivity, as behavioral effects would be indistinguishable from
those with subjective experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Courtship and Consciousness</strong>: Miller argues that
the gap between objective (third-person) and subjective (first-person)
consciousness can be bridged by examining second-person consciousness,
which emerges during courtship as partners exchange detailed information
about their inner experiences. This intimacy refutes the plausibility of
zombies, as genuine emotional and behavioral engagement contradicts
their absence of subjective experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reductionism vs Evolutionary Explanations</strong>: While
reductionism seeks to explain consciousness through neurobiological
processes, evolutionary explanations focus on how it contributed to
survival or reproduction. Miller contends that both approaches are valid
but that evolutionary theories are currently more sophisticated than
reductive ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reportability and Introspection</strong>: Consciousness
evolved partly due to sexual selection for reportable experiences during
courtship. This shaped our ability to articulate thoughts, feelings, and
memories effectively, making it a crucial aspect of human social
dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualia and Evolution</strong>: Miller argues that the
subjective nature of qualia (experiences like the redness of an apple)
arises from evolutionary pressures favoring reportability rather than
being arbitrary or irrelevant to survival advantages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consciousness Peak in Young Adulthood</strong>: Human
consciousness, including introspection, reaches its peak during late
adolescence and early adulthood, coinciding with heightened courtship
efforts. This period sees explorations of mysticism, altered states, and
philosophical inquiries as expressions of this consciousness
peak.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intimacy Evolution</strong>: Couples develop shared
interests, beliefs, and memories through efficient coordination, which
benefits both reproductive success and daily family life. This intimate
relationship evolved due to sexual selection pressures that favored such
cooperative units.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sexual Personae and Role-Playing</strong>: Sexual
courtship encouraged the evolution of the capacity for dramatic
role-playing or adopting different personalities (sexual personae) to
attract mates. This ability extended beyond conscious behavior to
influence beliefs, ideologies, and even physical traits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conscious Knowledge and Ideology</strong>: Sexual
selection may favor entertaining, exaggerated, or dramatic ideologies
over accurate ones, undermining the traditional evolutionary
epistemology view that natural selection inevitably produces reliable
knowledge. Human history supports this notion, showing a prevalence of
captivating but potentially inaccurate belief systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conscious Science</strong>: Miller posits that science
arose as an institution to harness human courtship efforts productively
by channeling ideological displays into rigorous methods for discovering
truth, thus creating a system that emphasizes evidence and argumentation
over entertainment and superficial appeal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, Miller proposes that human consciousness evolved under
the influence of sexual selection, shaping it to facilitate effective
communication, emotional connection, and strategic display during
courtship. While subjective experiences remain elusive to complete
explanation via reductionism, their evolutionary utility in social
dynamics suggests they cannot be dismissed as mere evolutionary
accidents or illusions.</p>

<p>The text discusses a study on the computational universality of
fungal sandpile automata, proposed by Eric Goles et al. This research
draws inspiration from compartmentalization within mycelia of
ascomycetous fungi, where septa with pores control the flow of cytoplasm
and organelles. The scientists designed two-dimensional fungal automata
based on cellular automaton principles but with a unique feature -
communication between neighboring cells can be blocked at will,
mimicking how Woronin bodies in fungi control pore openings.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that these fungal automata are
computationally universal by implementing sandpile cellular automata
circuits within them. They reduce the Monotone Circuit Value Problem to
the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem and construct families of wires,
crossovers, and gates to prove that the fungal automata are P-complete.
This means they can solve a broad range of problems in polynomial time,
establishing their computational power akin to traditional computers
(P-completeness).</p>
<p>The paper is divided into sections detailing the construction of
fungal automata (Section 2), representing these automata as chip-firing
models (Section 3), placing them within the context of computational
complexity (Section 4), and ultimately proving their P-completeness
through Boolean circuit implementations in Section 5. Alternative
versions for Woronin body state updates are also presented in Section 6,
with a discussion on future developments and feasibility in Section
7.</p>
<p>The broader significance of this research lies in its potential to
inspire the development of living fungal computers or computational
devices that leverage the unique properties of fungi for novel computing
paradigms. It also contributes to theoretical computer science by
providing a new model demonstrating computational universality, albeit
with distinct characteristics compared to traditional Turing
machines.</p>
<h3 id="fungal-electrical">2021-06-fungal-electrical</h3>
<p>In a recent study published in Biosystems, researchers from the
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and the University of the West of
England (UWE) Bristol have explored the potential of using fungal
electrical activity for computational purposes. The primary focus is on
the pink oyster mushroom, Pleurotus djamor, which exhibits complex
electrical signals that could be harnessed for information
processing.</p>
<p>The researchers demonstrate that the mycelium of the fungus generates
a series of spikes in electrical potential that propagate as the network
grows. This property is indicative of the intricate internal
communication within the organism, presenting a novel avenue for
computational measures. By analyzing and translating these electrical
signals into messages, researchers aim to develop a method to ‘program’
fungi for specific computing tasks.</p>
<p>To address the challenge of analyzing faint and complex electrical
signals from fungal tissues, the scientists propose an efficient
algorithm for detecting spike arrival times. This algorithm
characterizes the electrical activity, providing a foundation for
understanding and potentially exploiting the computational capabilities
inherent in fungi.</p>
<p>Fungi possess several attractive qualities as materials, including
resilience, rapid growth, self-maintenance, and no-cost availability.
Now, with the addition of their complex electrical signaling, fungi show
significant potential for use as environmental sensors on a large scale.
By connecting to and interpreting the information processed by fungal
networks, researchers could gain valuable insights into ecosystem
dynamics and respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Although fungal computers may not replace silicon chips due to slower
processing speeds, they offer an alternative approach for specific
applications where slow but distributed sensing and data analysis are
beneficial. The primary challenges remain in implementing meaningful
computing functions with fungi and uncovering their full computational
potential through thorough property characterization.</p>
<p>In summary, the study highlights a groundbreaking perspective on
utilizing fungal electrical activity for computation, opening doors to
novel applications in environmental monitoring and sensing, while also
advancing our understanding of complex biological communication
systems.</p>

<p>The paper explores the concept of “representational drift,” where
neural population codes continuously change even when animals have fully
learned and stably perform tasks. The authors propose that this drift
arises from an optimization process with a degenerate solution space,
where noisy synaptic updates drive the network to explore near-optimal
representations, causing representational drift while maintaining
stability in population coding.</p>
<p>The study focuses on Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network models for
representation learning that optimize similarity matching objectives and
learn localized receptive fields (RFs) tiling the stimulus manifold. The
authors demonstrate that drifting RFs can be described as a coordinated
random walk with effective diffusion constants depending on parameters
like learning rate, noise amplitude, and input statistics. Despite
individual neuron RF drift, population-level representational similarity
remains stable over time.</p>
<p>The model successfully recapitulates experimental observations in the
hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex and provides testable

<p>The provided text outlines a derivation of the rotational diffusion
constant, D_ϕ, for linear Hebbian/anti-Hebbian networks, which are used
to perform principal subspace projection tasks. The derivation relies on
two simplifying assumptions: neglecting correlation between angular
displacements at different times and considering that the network
weights start in an optimal solution space that remains stable under
drift.</p>
<p>The main steps of the derivation are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Defining single-step angular displacement (∆ϕ_i) to express the
average squared angular distance between initial and final states at
time t.</li>
<li>Approximating the double sum in equation (3) by focusing on the
variance of individual single-step angular displacements, assuming
negligible correlation between different times (equation 4).</li>
<li>Utilizing a linear stability analysis from references [3] and [4],
which suggests that perturbations away from the optimal solution space
decay exponentially over time. This implies that drift can be attributed
to rotational changes within the principal subspace, leading to equation
(6) where mean squared angular displacement (MSAD), ⟨|∆ϕ_i|^2⟩, remains
constant across time steps.</li>
<li>The learning rule with synaptic noise for the linear
Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network is given by equations (7). With this rule,
the perturbation δF around a fixed point ˆF = ˆM^(-1)ˆW can be
decomposed into rotation (δA), orthogonality deviation (δS), and weight
projection outside the principal subspace (δB).</li>
<li>Calculating the antisymmetric part δA from equation (9) using
properties of matrix multiplication and the learning rule.</li>
<li>Relating MSAD to δA through an infinitesimal rotation generator (⃗L),
where ⃗L represents small-angle rotations in d-dimensional space.
Specifically, the mean squared angular displacement is given by equation
(13): 2(∆ϕ)^2 = Tr(δAδA^T).</li>

<p>This study explores the application of the 2D Ising model, a
universal computational model reflecting phase transitions and critical
phenomena, to understand systems that exhibit criticality in relation to
complexity. The motivation arises from neuroscience applications linked
to algorithmic information theory (AIT).</p>
<p>The researchers examine various parameters influenced by the phase
transition, including correlation length of the spin lattice,
susceptibility to a uniform external field, magnetization time series

<p>Title: Sustainable Memristors from Shiitake Mycelium for
High-Frequency Bioelectronics</p>
<p>Authors: John LaRocco, Qudsia Tahmina, Ruben Petreaca, John Simonis,

<p>Summary: This study presents the development of sustainable
memristors using shiitake mycelium (Lentinula edodes) as an alternative
to conventional rare-earth material-based memristors and complex neural
organoid bioreactors. The researchers demonstrate that fungal memristors
can be grown, trained, preserved through dehydration, and retain
functionality at high frequencies up to 6 kHz, showing potential for
neuromorphic tasks in bioelectronics and unconventional computing.
Shiitake mushrooms exhibit radiation resistance, suggesting their
viability for aerospace applications.</p>
<p>Key Findings: 1. The researchers created fungal memristors using
shiitake mycelium cultivated on organic materials like farro seed, wheat
germ, and hay. 2. These memristors demonstrated memristive behavior
through electrical characterization involving voltage sweeps with both
square and sinusoidal waveforms. 3. The study identified an optimal
input voltage of 1 V peak-to-peak (Vpp) and a frequency range that
allowed for the detection of pinched hysteresis loops, characteristic of
memristive systems. 4. Volatile memory testing confirmed that these
fungal memristors could maintain their state over rapid write-read
cycles. 5. The mycelial structures inherently contain capacitive,
memfractive, and memristive proteins, which contribute to the observed
properties. 6. Fungal memristors offer several advantages over
conventional devices, including lower power requirements, lighter
weights, faster switching speeds, and reduced industrial overhead due to
their low-cost, organic nature.</p>
<p>Methodology: 1. Cultivation of shiitake mycelium samples in standard
polycarbonate petri dishes under controlled temperature (20-22°C) and
humidity (70%) conditions. 2. Dehydration process to transform the
fungal matrix into a rigid, disk-like structure while retaining
connectivity. 3. Electrical characterization using an alternating
current (AC) applied to samples and measuring the corresponding
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics via a digital oscilloscope. 4.
Volatile memory testing using an Arduino UNO microcontroller development
board and a voltage divider comprising two fungal memristors, evaluating
their memory capabilities through cyclic write-read operations.</p>
<p>Significance: The study bridges the gap between bioelectronics and
unconventional computing by proposing fungal computers as scalable,
eco-friendly platforms for neuromorphic tasks. The sustainable nature of
shiitake mycelium memristors could significantly reduce energy
consumption and electronic waste compared to conventional
semiconductor-based devices. Additionally, the radiation resistance
exhibited by shiitake mushrooms further expands their potential
applications in aerospace and related fields.</p>
<p>Limitations: 1. Short duration of the experiment (less than two
months). 2. Single, relatively bulky samples were used for testing, with
no miniaturization efforts. 3. Complications associated with growth
media and long-term preservation techniques were not thoroughly
explored.</p>
<p>Future Directions: 1. Optimization of cultivation techniques using
3D-printed templates to shape mycelial structures into desired
geometries. 2. Integration of electrical contacts into 3D-printed
cultivation structures for simplified programming. 3. Development and
combination of preservation techniques, such as dehydration,
desiccation, freeze-drying, hydrogels, or special coatings, to enable
long-term use while maintaining performance.</p>

<p>The paper proposes a massively parallel architecture, the Sparse
Ising Machine (sIM), designed to address the fundamental serial nature
of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms like Gibbs sampling. The
sIM achieves near-ideal parallelism by exploiting the sparsity in the
interconnection matrix, J, allowing its key figure of merit - flips per
second (fps) - to scale linearly with the number of probabilistic bits
(p-bits) in the system. This parallel architecture uses multiple
phase-shifted clocks controlling p-bit activation and a
multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit interconnecting them, effectively
implementing chromatic Gibbs sampling for large blocks of conditionally
independent nodes.</p>
<p>The sIM demonstrates significant speedups over CPU, GPU, and TPU
implementations in MCMC tasks, up to 6 orders of magnitude faster than a
CPU using standard Gibbs sampling and 5-18x faster compared to optimized
GPU/TPU solutions. In benchmark problems like integer factorization, the
sIM can reliably factor semiprimes up to 32 bits, surpassing previous
attempts from D-Wave and other probabilistic solvers. Moreover, it
outperforms competition-winning SAT solvers by 4-700x in runtime to
reach 95% accuracy for solving 3SAT problems.</p>
<p>Even when sampling is made inexact using faster clocks (a strategy
reminiscent of the Hogwild!-Gibbs algorithm), sIM can still find the
correct ground state with further speedup. The problem encoding and
sparsiﬁcation techniques introduced in this work are applicable to other
Ising Machines (classical and quantum) and the proposed architecture can
scale the current 5,000-10,000 p-bits to 1,000,000 or more through
analog CMOS or nanodevices.</p>
<p>The sIM’s performance is based on several key innovations: 1.
Systematic sparsiﬁcation techniques are introduced to convert any
combinatorial optimization problem into a sparse graph, using principles
of invertible logic and additional nodes without approximation. 2. A
massively parallel architecture is designed to implement the coupled
equations (Eq. 2-3) using multiple phase-shifted clocks controlling
p-bit activation and MAC units interconnecting them, allowing for
parallel updating of unconnected (conditionally independent) p-bits. 3.
The sIM can handle inexact Gibbs sampling by updating color blocks
before the MAC operation completes, which is shown to often lead to
finding exact ground states in optimization problems, reminiscent of
Hogwild!-Gibbs algorithms. Analytical estimates are provided for
limiting behaviors of inexact sampling. 4. The architecture and
techniques presented can be applied to a range of Ising Machines (both
classical and quantum) and scaled up using emerging nanodevice
technologies such as Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for even greater
speedup.</p>
<p>In summary, the Sparse Ising Machine (sIM) demonstrates significant
performance improvements in solving computationally challenging problems
by employing a novel parallel architecture that leverages sparsity and
systematic sparsiﬁcation techniques. This approach not only outperforms
existing CPU, GPU, and TPU implementations but also opens up new avenues
for scaling hardware solutions to handle larger problem instances in the
beyond Moore era of electronics.</p>
<p>The provided text discusses two graph modification techniques, fusion
and sparsiﬁcation, for probabilistic circuits used in quantum annealing
and adiabatic quantum computation. These methods aim to optimize the
vertex degree (number of neighbors) of nodes within a graph, with
implications for hardware-friendly designs and efficient clock speeds in
simulated annealing machines (sIM).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fusion</strong>: This technique combines multiple nodes
(p-bits) into one node. For an n-bit factorizer circuit, fusion reduces
the number of p-bits by merging input bits to AND gates with
corresponding FA inputs. The fused circuit has a generalized formula
N(fused)_fact = 3m² + m, where m = n/2. While software-friendly due to
reduced state space, it introduces fan-out issues and slows down the
clock speed in sIMs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sparsiﬁcation</strong>: This method splits a single node
into multiple nodes to limit the number of neighbors per node, defined
by k (maximum neighbors). For an n-bit factorizer circuit, the
generalized formula for a sparsiﬁed circuit is N(sparse)_fact = 8m² - 5m
+ 2mf(m, k), where f(m, k) calculates additional p-bits needed based on
m and k. This hardware-friendly approach reduces fan-out issues but
requires careful selection of the maximum neighbors (k) to balance
resource usage and performance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Graph Density</strong>: The text analyzes graph density
as a function of problem size for integer factorization and 3SAT
problems at varying k values, demonstrating that even without
sparsiﬁcation, these instances progressively decrease in graph density,
allowing efﬁcient representation on sparse hardware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance Projections</strong>: The projections
consider up to a million p-bits for the 3SAT problem using MRAM
technology, estimating 20 µW per p-bit. Sparsiﬁed circuits allow faster
flips per second (fps) within given power and area budgets, though
denser graphs can accommodate larger problems with diminishing returns
beyond a certain point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invertible Boolean Logic vs. Minor Graph
Embedding</strong>: A comparison between these two approaches for the
integer factorization problem reveals that an invertible Boolean logic
embedding can factor any number up to 32 bits using only a sparsiﬁed
graph with k = 4, having 2128 spins, while minor graph embedding (MGE)
fails beyond specific sizes on Chimera, King’s, and grid
graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Models for Inexact Gibbs Sampling</strong>: Two
error models for inexact Gibbs sampling are introduced to study the
impact of moderate overclocking on a 5-p-bit full adder circuit. Both
models show similar behavior, with divergence at a certain error
threshold and convergence to a parallel update distribution described by
Eq. (S.22).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text presents techniques for optimizing probabilistic
circuits in quantum annealing and adiabatic quantum computation,
focusing on graph fusion and sparsiﬁcation methods tailored for
hardware-friendly designs in simulated annealing machines. It also
discusses performance projections, compares different embedding
techniques, and analyzes error models for inexact Gibbs sampling under

<p>This study presents an exact solution for the synchronous dynamics of
the Ising model on random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions in
the high-connectivity limit. The spins evolve according to a stochastic
rule governed by threshold noise, which can lead to nonequilibrium
stationary states not described by the Boltzmann distribution.</p>
<p>The authors derive a dynamical equation for the distribution of local
magnetizations, enabling them to determine the critical line separating
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. For random graphs with a negative
binomial degree distribution, they demonstrate that stationary critical
behavior and long-time critical dynamics depend on the threshold noise
distribution. In particular, for an algebraic threshold noise, these
properties are determined by the power-law tails of the threshold noise
distribution.</p>
<p>The relaxation time of the average magnetization inside each phase
always exhibits mean-field critical scaling, regardless of the threshold
noise distribution. The work highlights that details of microscopic
dynamics and the absence of detailed balance significantly influence the
critical behavior of nonequilibrium spin systems. Numerical simulations
confirm the theoretical results.</p>
<p>Key points: 1. The Ising model’s synchronous dynamics on random

on threshold noise distribution. 3. Critical line separating
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases is determined from the derived
dynamical equation. 4. Stationary critical behavior for negative

<p>The research paper titled “Nonreciprocal Ising model” by Yael Avni,
Michel Fruchart, David Martin, Daniel Seara, and Vincenzo Vitelli
investigates the behavior of a nonreciprocal generalization of the
well-known Ising model in both two and three dimensions. The study aims
to understand the stability of uniform nonreciprocal phases in noisy
spatially extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and
the nature of corresponding phase transitions.</p>
<p>The paper begins by explaining how nonreciprocal interactions lead to
time-dependent states observed in various finite systems ranging from
neuroscience to active matter. These systems display globally ordered
oscillations but the stability, persistence in larger scales, and
critical behavior of such phases remain poorly understood. To address
these questions, the authors introduce a nonreciprocal generalization of
the Ising model and examine its phase transitions using numerical and
analytical approaches.</p>
<p>The mean-field equations suggest three stable homogeneous phases:
disordered, ordered, and a time-dependent “swap” phase characterized by
repeated flipping of magnetizations between two species (A and B).
However, extensive numerical simulations uncover a more complex picture
than predicted by the mean-field theory.</p>
<p>In 2D systems, any nonreciprocity leads to destruction of static
order due to the growth of rare droplets unless there’s a symmetry
breaking between spin types, which can trigger a stabilizing
droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations
in two dimensions through proliferation of spiral defects but it’s
stabilized in three dimensions where nonreciprocity alters critical
exponents from Ising to XY, resulting in a robust spatially-distributed
“clock.”</p>
<p>The study highlights that static order is unstable in any finite
dimension due to droplet growth, and the swap phase is destroyed by
fluctuations in two dimensions but stabilized in three dimensions. In
3D, the nonreciprocal interactions lead to critical exponents matching
those of the 3D XY model, indicating a temporal crystal behavior
characterized by well-defined long-range temporal order and spatially
distributed clock.</p>
<p>The research extends our understanding of nonreciprocal systems and
provides insights into how nonreciprocity impacts phase transitions in
spatially extended systems. It also reveals the possibility for stable,
persistent oscillations in finite systems, which could have implications
in various fields such as neuroscience, social dynamics, and quantum
physics.</p>
<p>Key points from the paper include: - Introduction of a nonreciprocal
Ising model to study time-dependent states in spatially extended
systems. - Observation of three stable phases (disordered, ordered,
swap) via mean-field equations. - Numerical simulations revealing
complex behavior in 2D and 3D systems, with the swap phase’s stability
contingent on dimensionality and symmetry breaking. - Emergence of
temporal crystal behavior in 3D, characterized by robust spatial
distribution of a clock, resulting from nonreciprocity-induced changes
in critical exponents to match those of the XY model. - Implications for
various fields including neuroscience, social dynamics, and quantum
physics where nonreciprocal interactions are significant.</p>

<p>The provided text outlines a study that proposes a unified framework
for episodic memory and spatial representation in the hippocampus, using
a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) model to simulate the CA3 region. The RAE
is trained on an artificial agent navigating various environments,
receiving partial and noisy sensory inputs while attempting to
reconstruct complete experiences based on prior encounters.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates that this network naturally develops
place-like responses through a combination of pattern completion and
firing rate regularization, enabling robust recall of spatial experience
at any location. Emergent place cells exhibit remapping characteristics
reminiscent of rodent hippocampal studies, including cells that only
fire in specific environments or change firing locations when entering
novel spaces while reverting to previous patterns in familiar
environments. Additionally, the network generates orthogonal spatial
representations for different rooms and displays gradual drifts in place
fields over time, paralleling experimental findings of continuous
learning processes in place cells.</p>
<p>The research suggests that weakly spatially modulated (WSM) sensory
experience signals serve as primary drivers of place cell generation by
encoding location-dependent experiences. Neurons contributing more to
pattern completion have a greater impact on the network’s attractor
dynamics, with recurrent connections facilitating remapping and
reversion in familiar environments. The model further predicts that
rapidly changing sensory contexts disrupt place fields, blocking CA3
recurrent connections prevents new spatial representation formation but
not place cell emergence, and dimensionality of temporally smooth
experience dictates the dimensionality of place fields during navigation
in both physical and abstract spaces.</p>
<p>Key findings include: 1. Place-like firing patterns emerge naturally
from RAE dynamics without explicit sparsity constraints. 2. Emergent
place cells display remapping, orthogonality, robustness across
environment shapes, and slow drift consistent with hippocampal
phenomenology. 3. Network’s performance is robust to variations in
several parameters, such as input duration, total trial length, recall
length, firing rate loss coefficient, maximum firing rate of WSM
signals, sigma value for smoothing WSM signals, and fraction of unmasked
experiences during training. 4. The RAE model aligns with classical
attractor network theory for place cells by converging to stable states
when presented with constant inputs.</p>
<p>Overall, this study proposes a simple yet powerful framework that
reproduces significant aspects of place cell phenomenology and offers
testable predictions about the role of recurrent connectivity in
episodic memory and spatial representation within the hippocampus.</p>

<p>The research paper discussed here investigates dynamical phase
transitions in a nonreciprocal Ising model, which features two spin
species with opposing goals. The model is studied using both analytical
arguments and extensive Monte Carlo simulations to understand the
system’s behavior, stability, and critical phenomena, particularly
focusing on time-dependent states and their potential as proper
non-equilibrium phases of matter.</p>
<p>Key findings include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Existence of a Time-Dependent (Swap) Phase in
3D</strong>: Large scale numerical simulations support that a stable
swap phase with long-range spatial and temporal order exists in three
dimensions, where the magnetization oscillates indefinitely. This
behavior is similar to a time crystal, characterized by a diverging
coherence time in the thermodynamic limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Critical Exponents</strong>: The transition from disorder
to swap in 3D was found to be second-order with critical exponents ν =
0.675 ± 0.005, γ = 1.328 ± 0.009, and β = 0.347 ± 0.002. These values
align well with the universality class of the 3D XY model (νXY = 0.672,
γXY = 1.318, βXY = 0.349) rather than the 3D Ising model (νI = 0.630, γI
= 1.237, βI = 0.326).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Absence of a Stable Swap Phase in 2D</strong>: In two
dimensions, simulations suggest that the swap phase is unstable due to
spiral defects, transitioning instead to a disordered state as system
size increases. This lack of a well-defined phase transition in the
thermodynamic limit contrasts with the findings in three
dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Destabilization of Static Order Phase via
Droplets</strong>: Both in 2D and 3D, the static ordered phase is
destabilized by nucleation of droplets for increasing system sizes. In
3D, this process does not result in a clear first-order transition but
instead suggests a continuous shift away from static order as systems
grow larger.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comparison with Existing Theories</strong>: The behavior
of the nonreciprocal Ising model shows parallels with surface roughening
and the Mermin-Wagner theorem in time domains, suggesting that stable
time-periodic states can emerge in many-body systems under the right
conditions—specifically, when the continuous time-translation symmetry
is broken.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The study concludes by highlighting how nonreciprocal interactions in
many-body systems could give rise to novel phases and phase transitions,
bridging the gap between equilibrium statistical physics and
nonequilibrium phenomena, with potential implications for understanding
complex behavior in diverse fields ranging from neuroscience to open
quantum systems.</p>
<p>The text discusses a study on nonreciprocal many-body dynamics using
a nonreciprocal Ising model. The main finding is the stability of a
time-dependent (swap) phase in 3D, which behaves as a time-crystal with
infinite coherence time in the thermodynamic limit. The phase transition
from disorder to swap is characterized by critical exponents compatible
with the 3D XY model, indicating a breakdown of time-reversal symmetry
through droplet growth in the metastable species. In contrast, the
static-order (ferromagnetic) phase is unstable in any finite dimension
for fully anti-symmetric interactions due to this droplet instability
mechanism. When interspecies interactions have opposite signs but are
not fully anti-symmetric, a competing droplet-capture mechanism can
stabilize the static-order phase. The absence of an infinite-period
phase transition is noted when interactions are fully anti-symmetric.
Simulations in both 2D and 3D demonstrate these phenomena, revealing
complex behavior including coarsening dynamics, scroll waves, planar
waves, and droplet capture mechanisms influenced by the degree of
asymmetry between species. The study constructs schematic phase diagrams
in 2D and 3D for different asymmetric cases, suggesting that while
static order is unstable in 2D for any finite dimension with
anti-symmetric interactions, a stable swap phase exists in 3D alongside
disorder and static order phases. The transitions between these phases
do not show direct transitions between time-dependent and static-ordered
phases but rather pass through disordered intermediary states,
indicating potential first-order-like behavior in certain regimes.</p>

reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC) for
dynamic environments with heterogeneous constraints. The proposed method
leverages a graph neural network trained via RL to estimate the

<p>The paper presents a new Learning-based Ensemble Method with Optimal
Selection Strategy (LbEM-OSS) for outlier detection that focuses on
selecting top-performing constituent models dynamically. The method

<p>The chapter discusses two types of semantics for probabilistic
programs: operational and denotational. Operational semantics models
step-by-step executions on a machine, focusing on the evolution of
memory states and stacks of instructions. Denotational semantics,
however, models the intended mathematical meaning of a program in terms
of probability distributions. The chapter provides a simple imperative
probabilistic language with examples like coin-tossing, random walk, π
computation, and Cantor distribution generation.</p>
<p>The operational semantics for this language is defined through a
single-step reduction relation that describes how the state changes
after executing each command. Probabilities are assigned based on the
outcomes of probabilistic constructs such as coin() and rand(). The
chapter then delves into denotational semantics, interpreting programs
as operators mapping probability distributions to sub-probability
distributions (measures).</p>
<p>Key points from examples include: 1. <strong>Simple Markov
Chain</strong>: The program
<code>x := 0; while x == 0 do x := coin()</code> outputs a Dirac delta
over 1 when given any input measure, consistent with the operational
semantics. 2. <strong>Random Walk on Z^2</strong>: The denotational
semantics for the random walk involves computing probabilities of
reaching (0,0) in different numbers of steps using the Markov kernel
approach and combining them appropriately. 3. <strong>Pi
Approximation</strong>: The probabilistic computation of π uses a
binomial distribution to estimate π and provides a tighter bound with
Hoeffding’s inequality compared to Chebyshev’s inequality. 4.
<strong>Cantor Distribution</strong>: Despite the program not
terminating, it can be given a denotational semantics as an operator
mapping measures to those corresponding to real numbers whose base-3
expansion contains no 1’s, aligning with the operational
interpretation.</p>
<p>The text emphasizes how denotational semantics capture all possible
execution paths simultaneously and provide a unified view of
probabilistic behaviors, contrasting it with the stepwise approach of
operational semantics.</p>
<p>The chapter explores the use of Type-2 computable distributions to
provide both algorithmic sampling and distributional semantics for
probabilistic programs with continuous distributions. It begins by
defining Type-2 computability, which allows for the representation of
continuum-sized objects as sequences of discrete approximations that
converge to the desired object, rather than abstracting such
representations. The authors then discuss implementing continuous
distributions as a library in a general-purpose programming language,
specifically focusing on Haskell. They provide an example implementation
sketch and review mathematical structures, like topological domains,
suitable for modeling such libraries.</p>
<p>The chapter introduces λCD, a PCF-like core language extended with
reals and continuous distributions via a probability monad, as the
target for giving both sampling and distributional semantics. Sampling
semantics can guide implementation, while distributional semantics
allows for equational reasoning. The authors also examine how adopting a
Type-2 computable perspective impacts Bayesian inference, specifically
addressing that conditioning is not (Type-2) computable in general.
Although this presents a challenge for probabilistic programming
languages that aim to be Turing-complete, such pathologies are uncommon
in practice, and the authors show how one can recover conditioning under
sufficiently general settings.</p>
<p>The chapter emphasizes the connection between Type-2 computability
and conventional programming practices through examples in Haskell, and
highlights the relationship with constructive mathematics via
realizability. It also discusses prerequisites like familiarity with
category theory, programming language semantics, complete partial orders
(CPOs), measure-theoretic probability, and basic knowledge of the
Haskell programming language.</p>
<p>In summary, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of
Type-2 computable distributions for probabilistic programs, including
their implementation in Haskell, appropriate mathematical structures to
model them, and implications for probabilistic inference, all while
maintaining connections to both practical programming and constructive
mathematics.</p>
<p>Summary: The chapter discusses probabilistic λ-calculi, focusing on
two main types: randomized λ-calculi and Bayesian λ-calculi. Randomized
λ-calculi introduce fair binary probabilistic choice operators that
allow terms to evolve either deterministically or probabilistically, and
have been studied in relation to operational semantics, expressive
power, and termination properties. Bayesian λ-calculi use sampling and
conditioning operators to model bayesian networks and probabilistic
graphical models. The chapter provides a brief overview of both types of
λ-calculi, their operational semantics, and some challenges faced in
their analysis, including issues with contextual equivalence,
denotational semantics, and the expressive power of higher-order
probabilistic programs. A sampling-based operational semantics for
Bayesian λ-calculi is also discussed.</p>
<p>The chapter emphasizes that probabilistic λ-calculi are still under
investigation by computer science communities, particularly in terms of
their denotational semantics. The chapter mainly focuses on randomized
λ-calculi (PCF⊕), presenting its types, term and value structures,
operational semantics, contextual equivalence, and expressive power. It
highlights progress and subject reduction properties and introduces two
notions of termination—almost sure termination and positive almost sure
termination—and discusses techniques for ensuring termination in
probabilistic programs.</p>
<p>In the realm of Bayesian λ-calculi, the chapter provides a snapshot
into their design principles, highlighting the use of sampling and
conditioning operators to model bayesian networks and graphical models.
The text briefly mentions trace and distribution semantics introduced by
Borgström et al. (2016) and logical relations for typed Bayesian
λ-calculi as per Culpepper and Cobb (2017). Lastly, sampling-based
operational semantics for Bayesian λ-calculi is hinted at.</p>
<p>In summary, the chapter offers an introductory yet comprehensive
exploration of probabilistic λ-calculi—both randomized and Bayesian
varieties—focusing on their syntax, semantics, and key properties while
acknowledging ongoing research challenges and future directions in this
field.</p>
<p>The text discusses the challenges and nuances of reasoning about
expected runtimes of probabilistic programs, highlighting that the
classical notions of termination for ordinary programs are too strong or
too weak when applied to probabilistic programs. Instead, the authors
propose positive almost-sure termination as a more suitable
probabilistic analog, which requires that a program’s expected runtime
is finite. However, they note that positive almost-sure termination is
not compositional, meaning that running two such terminating programs in
sequence might not yield another almost-surely terminating program.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, the authors introduce an expected
runtime calculus (ert-calculus) as a sound and complete method for
analyzing expected runtimes of probabilistic programs. The ert-calculus
is based on backward reasoning, using a continuation-passing style to
associate with every program a runtime function capturing the average or
expected time taken by executing the program from an initial state.</p>
<p>The ert-transformer is defined for each statement in their simple
probabilistic Guarded Command Language (pGCL) and adheres to a basic
runtime model described in Section 6.2. The text provides deﬁnitions for
empty programs, random assignments, sequential composition, conditional
choices, and nondeterministic choices, illustrating how expected
runtimes are computed in each case.</p>
<p>For instance, the expected runtime of an empty program is simply the
continuation (postruntime) itself, while random assignments incur a unit
of time and update the continuation to account for new values sampled
from a probability distribution. Sequential composition combines the
expected runtimes of its constituent programs, and conditional choices
and nondeterministic choices incorporate guard evaluations and
demonic/angelic scheduling, respectively.</p>
<p>The ert-calculus is compositional, enabling the analysis of more
complex probabilistic programs by breaking them down into smaller
components. Moreover, it offers a way to determine whether a program
terminates positively almost surely and can bound expected runtimes from
above and below on the source code level. The approach has been
successfully applied to various examples, including randomized
algorithms and Bayesian networks, with some analyses fully
automated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the ert-calculus offers a systematic method for
analyzing the expected runtimes of probabilistic programs by leveraging
standard techniques from formal semantics and program verification, such
as denotational semantics, fixed point theory, and invariants. This
approach simplifies the often subtle and intricate nature of reasoning
about expected runtimes in probabilistic settings while being amenable
to a large degree of automation.</p>
<p>The text discusses termination analysis of probabilistic programs
using martingales, focusing on theoretical foundations and algorithmic
approaches for bounded termination. The key contributions include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Ranking Supermartingales (RSMs)</strong>: RSMs are used
to prove almost-sure termination of affine probabilistic programs
without non-determinism. They must satisfy conditions related to
integrability, lower bounds, and ranking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connection to Stochastic Processes</strong>: The
semantics of probabilistic programs with non-determinism is linked to
stochastic processes, adapted to a filtration. A program’s execution
generates a random run, where conﬁgurations are adapted to the
ﬁltration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Termination Questions for Probabilistic
Programs</strong>: Various termination questions are
introduced—almost-sure termination, finite/bounded termination, and
probabilistic termination—each with distinct requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Affine Programs without Non-determinism</strong>:
Chakarov and Sankaranarayanan (2013) proposed RSMs as a sound approach
to prove almost-sure termination of affine probabilistic programs
without non-determinism. This approach uses RSM-maps, which map program
conﬁgurations to real numbers and satisfy conditions ensuring that the
program terminates when the mapping’s value is negative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RSM-Maps</strong>: An RSM-map (η) for a given invariant I
must meet criteria like integrability, lower bounds, ranking, and
preservation under program statements. The expected termination time of
programs with such maps is bounded by η(ℓ0,xinit) - K/ϵ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completeness and Soundness</strong>: Proposition 7.9
establishes the soundness of RSM-maps for bounded termination. Fu and
Chatterjee (2019) provide a completeness result for RSM-maps with
integer-valued variables, ensuring the existence of an RSM-map implies
bounded termination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Linear and polynomial RSM-maps can
be synthesized algorithmically given appropriate invariants, using
linear programming to solve Farkas’ linear assertions or
Positivstellensatz for polynomial cases. These algorithms are sound and
run in polynomial time for affine programs without
non-determinism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Beyond Bounded Termination</strong>: McIver et al. (2018)
introduced parametric ranking supermartingales (PRSMs), extending RSMs
to handle zero trend and Zeno behavior, allowing for proofs of
almost-sure termination in cases where traditional RSMs fail due to
non-decreasing expectations or diminishing progress towards
termination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Zeno Behavior</strong>: PRSMs address Zeno behavior by
requiring a positive probability of a strict decrease in value as the
process approaches zero, preventing scenarios where programs approach
zero without terminating.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this chapter presents theoretical foundations and
algorithmic techniques for analyzing the termination of probabilistic
programs using martingales. These methods are sound and, in many cases,
complete, providing a practical approach to automated program analysis
of stochastic systems modeled by probabilistic programs. The extension
to affine programs with non-determinism is also discussed, alongside
algorithms for synthesizing linear and polynomial RSMs under specific
conditions.</p>
<p>The chapter discusses the application of concentration of measure
inequalities for quantitative analysis of probabilistic programs,
focusing on approaches to handle various limitations of
Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds. The key challenges in this area include
dealing with unbounded support random variables, nonlinear functions,
and correlated random variables.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Unbounded Support</strong>: To address the issue of
random variables with unbounded support, one can use interval arithmetic
to approximate missing moment information. This approximation may be
crude but serves as a necessary trade-off when only limited moment data
is available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nonlinear Functions</strong>: The Bernstein inequality
addresses nonlinear functions by using higher moments (beyond the first
and second) of random variables, providing potentially tighter bounds
than Chernoff-Hoeﬀding for certain types of functions. However,
computing these higher moments can be challenging.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Correlated Random Variables</strong>: The Janson
inequality extends concentration results to correlated random variables,
particularly those structured by an undirected graph (a correlation
graph). This approach considers the chromatic number of the graph for
bounding tail probabilities and provides a way to handle dependencies
among random variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The chapter also introduces control deterministic programs, which are
probabilistic programs without conditional statements or
nondeterministic choices, and emphasize their relevance in domains like
cyber-physical systems. These programs can be analyzed using affine
forms, which abstract the dependency of program variables on
distributions while preserving control determinism.</p>
<p>Affine forms allow for symbolic execution, where programs are
represented as a series of operations (assignments, repetitions) over
noise symbols within an environment, which specifies ranges and moments
of these symbols. The chapter outlines how to propagate uncertainty
through such computations, focusing on handling sums, differences,
products, and continuous functions.</p>
<p>For quantitative analysis, concentration inequalities can be applied
directly to affine forms, using Chernoff-Hoeﬀding bounds, Bernstein’s
inequality, or Janson’s inequality based on the characteristics of the
noise symbols and their dependencies. The chapter presents a prototype
implementation illustrating these techniques on various examples,
including a 2D robotic end effector and an underwater vehicle movement
simulation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while considerable progress has been made in
quantitative analysis using concentration of measure inequalities,
significant challenges remain, particularly concerning the automation of
identifying relevant affine forms, handling unbounded support, and
integrating these techniques with broader Bayesian inference methods in
probabilistic programming. Future work should focus on addressing these
open problems to enhance the practical applicability of such
approaches.</p>
<p>The text discusses quantitative equational logic as an extension of
traditional equational logic to accommodate metric reasoning, which is
crucial for probabilistic programming. The core concept revolves around
equations indexed by positive rational numbers, representing “how close”
two terms or states are rather than their exact equivalence.</p>
<p>Key points include: - Traditional equational logic focuses on
equivalence relations and axiomatic systems with rules like reflexivity,
symmetry, transitivity, congruence, substitution, cut, and assumption. -
Quantitative equational logic replaces the equivalence relation with a
metric space, using equations of the form <span class="math inline">\(s
= \varepsilon t\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is a positive real number
indicating closeness. - The concept extends to algebra, with the notion
of an equational theory U axiomatizing a collection of judgements in
J(TX). An algebra A satisfying all judgements in U is written <span
class="math inline">\(A |=\)</span> U. - Birkhoﬀ’s completeness theorem,
stating that <span class="math inline">\(U |=\)</span> (Γ ⊢φ) if and
only if (Γ ⊢φ) ∈U, serves as a fundamental result linking deducibility
to satisfiability in classical equational logic. - The text aims to
adapt this framework to probabilistic programming by introducing
quantitative equations, which naturally lead to metrics like the
Kantorovich (Wasserstein) metric. It is expected that these ideas will
provide a robust foundation for reasoning about probabilistic programs
using quantitative methods.</p>
<p>The text emphasizes that quantitative equational logic offers a
natural way to handle approximate relationships and metrics in
programming language semantics, especially beneficial for dealing with
probabilistic scenarios. This approach avoids some of the limitations of
traditional equivalence-based reasoning and aligns well with the need
for metric-based comparisons in fields like machine learning and
probabilistic programming.</p>
<p>This text discusses the application of probabilistic abstract
interpretation to privacy protection within a conservative risk-averse
analysis context. It addresses the challenges posed by approximate
inference in probabilistic programming, which can underestimate an
adversary’s knowledge and overlook worst-case scenarios. The authors
propose quantitative properties like Disparate Impact Ratio and
Posterior Bayes Vulnerability to model privacy risks. They introduce a
language called ImpWhile with probabilistic constructs for modeling
adversarial behavior and provide its concrete probabilistic semantics in
Figure 11.2.</p>
<p>The paper outlines the limitations of exact inference, which is
impractical due to large state spaces, and presents an abstract
interpretation approach to overcome these challenges while maintaining
soundness regarding privacy risk bounds. They define a dual-bounded
probabilistic domain (D) combining precision and efficiency for
representing probability distributions and provide its abstract
semantics in Figure 11.2. The abstract domain D is built on top of any
given concrete state domain, ensuring that the abstraction
over-approximates the concrete behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they discuss the challenges in abstracting looping
constructs due to potential infinite iterations, proposing wider
operators as a solution but noting that defining such operators for
probabilistic semantics with sound conditioning remains an open problem.
As an application, they demonstrate a privacy monitor leveraging state
probability bounds for assessing posterior Bayes vulnerability without
needing exact knowledge of the adversary’s prior information.</p>
<p>The authors compare their work to related techniques in abstract
interpretation, dynamic program analysis, probabilistic programming, and
quantitative information flow measurements. They highlight the
significance of their approach by addressing privacy issues with
background knowledge assumptions while preserving a soundness criterion
through probabilistic abstract interpretation.</p>
<p>The text describes a concrete programming language named Kuifje,
which is designed to model Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) in
computer programs. QIF deals with measuring the amount of information
that leaks from a program’s state to an observer, rather than just
determining if leaks occur. The approach combines monads and QIF by
lifting the discrete distribution monad D from base sets A to
computations over A, resulting in a model for QIF using
hyper-distributions (D2A), which are distributions of distributions.</p>
<p>Kuifje is built upon Haskell’s support for monads, using the
probability monad D as its foundation. The language’s semantics are
defined via folds, where the syntactic domain of Kuifje programs is
represented as a free monoid and its denotational semantics is captured
by a monoid morphism. This approach allows for straightforward
implementation through Haskell functional programming techniques.</p>
<p>The chapter also outlines three stages in developing Kuifje: basic
command language (CL), probabilistic command language (PCL), and the
addition of observations to form QIF-aware programs, resulting in
Kuifje. The semantics for each stage use monoids, compositional by
construction, with an algebra on s → s initially, later extended to s →
d s and finally to s → db s.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the text discusses abstracting from observed values to
focus solely on leaked information through hyper-distributions. It
introduces a function <code>toPair</code> that converts Dist (Bits,s) to
(Dist Bits, Bits → Dist s), which is subsequently used to compute
hyper-distributions of final states directly without constructing
sequences of observations first. The resulting hyper semantics allows
for full abstraction in QIF theory by ensuring two programs are
behaviorally equivalent when their denotations match.</p>
<p>The practical utility of hyper-distributions lies in their direct
computation, eliminating the need for post-processing to remove observed
value details while still retaining essential information about leaked
data. This optimization is achieved through a fold fusion process that
merges the steps of generating observation sequences and condensing them
into hyper-distributions into one operation.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes with case studies demonstrating Kuifje’s
application in analyzing security aspects, such as Monty Hall problem
and side-channel attacks on cryptographic algorithms. These examples
illustrate how Kuifje facilitates reasoning about information leakage,
offering insights into attack vulnerabilities and potential defense
mechanisms in practical scenarios.</p>
<p>The chapter presents Luck, a probabilistic domain-specific language
for writing random test case generators as annotated predicates. Luck’s
semantics combines local instantiation with constraint solving to
balance the benefits of both approaches. The language features
lightweight annotations that control the distribution of generated
values and the extent of constraint solving before variable
instantiation. This design aims to simplify the creation, maintenance,
and understanding of generators, addressing the challenges faced in
writing complex generators.</p>
<p>The core of Luck is formalized with a probabilistic calculus, which
includes a predicate semantics for standard expressions and non-standard
constructs like sample-after expressions. The chapter lays out typing
rules for Core Luck, extending simply typed call-by-value lambda
calculus with sum types, products, iso-recursive types, binary sums, and
first-class recursive functions. Unknowns are introduced as special
values with associated domains of possible values, ensuring they adhere
to non-functional types to avoid complex higher-order unification.</p>
<p>To handle probabilistic generation, the chapter outlines an interface
for a constraint solver, focusing on operations like fresh unknown
generation, type preservation under unification, satisfiability checks,
value extraction, and sampling. The narrowing semantics is presented as
a foundation, leveraging these constraints while enabling users to
control distribution through weight annotations reminiscent of
QuickCheck’s frequency combinator. This semantics ensures that generated
valuations align with desired predicates and maintains ﬁniteness for
efficient backtracking.</p>
<p>A matching semantics builds upon narrowing by incorporating pattern
guidance, allowing the generator to look ahead in computation, thus
avoiding fruitless case branches and reducing backtracking. The rules
for Core Luck constructs are detailed, including handling for base
values, pairs, sums (case expressions), applications, sequencing, and
instantiation with sampling.</p>
<p>The chapter further explores properties of Luck’s semantics:
decreasingness ensures that constraint sets only shrink; soundness links
generator derivations to predicate executions, while completeness
guarantees that all matching valuations can be produced by some
generator derivation. These properties are formally stated and partially
proven for both narrowing and matching semantics, with Coq-verified
proofs for the former.</p>
<p>To validate Luck’s practicality, the chapter evaluates it against
various small examples and significant case studies: well-typed lambda
terms to test GHC’s strictness analyzer and information-flow control
machine states. Results show that Luck can achieve effectiveness
comparable to state-of-the-art generators while reducing code complexity
significantly, although its prototype is slower due to interpretation
overhead. Future work involves creating a more efficient, compiling
implementation directly to QuickCheck generators.</p>
<p>In essence, Luck offers a novel approach to combining local
instantiation with global constraint solving for random test case
generation, demonstrating potential in simplifying the process and
reducing code size while maintaining effectiveness. The chapter
underscores its practical utility through real-world application
examples and formal foundations.</p>
<p>Tabular is a domain-specific language designed for expressing
probabilistic models of relational data. Its key features include
storing programs and data as spreadsheet tables, defining programs using
probabilistic annotations on the relational schema, and returning
estimations for missing values and latent columns along with parameters
during inference. The primary implementation targets Microsoft Excel
using Infer.NET for inference, though it can be used independently
without Excel and target different inference engines.</p>
<p>Key advancements in this new version of Tabular include: 1.
User-defined functions to abstract repeated code blocks, making schemas
more concise. 2. A structural dependent type system facilitating
understanding of the sample space and catching common modelling
mistakes. 3. Reduction relation reducing programs with function
applications to Core models corresponding directly to factor graphs. 4.
Introduction of query variables for extracting properties like means or
biases from inferred distributions, enabling pseudo-deterministic data
calculations dependent on inference results.</p>
<p>Tabular’s design emphasizes ease of use, particularly for
non-programmers like domain experts by extending relational database
schemas with probabilistic model expressions and annotations instead of
requiring users to write full programs. This approach avoids the need to
manipulate or pre-process data before feeding it into the program,
making it more accessible.</p>
<p>The language supports functions defined similarly to tables and can
be used to abstract repetitive code blocks, simplifying models. Tabular
comes with a library of predefined conjugate models but allows users to
define their own functions, adhering to its dependent type system that
supports basic array types and space annotations dividing columns into
deterministic, random, or query categories.</p>
<p>Inferencing in Tabular uses Expectation Propagation as the default
algorithm. The model and input data are decoupled, allowing for
inference with multiple datasets without modifying the model itself.
Users can perform queries based on missing values by extending tables to
include them and then running inference to obtain distributions on those
missing values.</p>
<p>Tabular’s syntax distinguishes between internal (local) column names
and external (global) field names to resolve issues with α-conversion,
ensuring proper function application and referencing across scopes. Its
type system is built around structural types that detail variable usage,
domains, determinacies, and roles within the models.</p>
<p>Tabular’s reduction relation, proven type-sound through a formal
metatheory, converts complex models into Core form, directly
translatable to factor graphs. This ensures that programs adhere to
well-defined rules and prevents erroneous dependencies between columns
by enforcing space annotations. The system’s design aims at balancing
expressiveness with performance while providing an intuitive interface
suitable for users without extensive programming expertise.</p>
<p>The text discusses Rely, a programming language designed for
reasoning about the quantitative reliability of applications when
executed on unreliable hardware. Unlike traditional approaches that
focus on exact correctness or basic error masking, Rely allows
developers to specify the probability that an approximate computation
produces the correct result, enabling sound and verified reliability
engineering.</p>
<p>Rely’s core features include: 1. <strong>Reliability
Specifications</strong>: Developers can express reliability requirements
for each value produced by a function, specifying the minimum acceptable
probability of producing the correct output despite potential soft
errors. 2. <strong>Language (Rely)</strong>: Rely is an imperative
language that supports computations over integers and multidimensional
arrays. It allows developers to allocate data in unreliable memory
regions and perform unreliable arithmetic/logical operations, catering
to approximate computing needs where some error tolerance is acceptable.
3. <strong>Static Quantitative Reliability Analysis</strong>: The
analysis takes a Rely program alongside a hardware reliability
specification. For each function, it computes a conservative
precondition that bounds the set of valid specifications based on the
reliability of underlying unreliable hardware components. This
verification ensures that given conditions are met when the program runs
on specified hardware. 4. <strong>Example</strong>: A pixel block search
algorithm from the x264 video encoder is provided as an illustration,
demonstrating Rely’s practical application for approximate computations
where some error tolerance is acceptable and error detection/masking can
be costly or inefficient. 5. <strong>Hardware Semantics</strong>: Rely
targets hardware architectures with reliable operations (guaranteed
correctness) and unreliable ones (potentially erroneous but more
energy-efficient). Unreliable operations include reads from and writes
to unreliable memory regions, as well as arithmetic/logical operations
that might suffer from soft errors. 6. <strong>Precondition Generation
and Checking</strong>: Rely’s analysis first generates a precondition
for each function, which bounds the set of valid specifications based on
hardware reliability. It then checks if provided specifications satisfy
this precondition. If valid, the program meets its reliability
requirements on unreliable hardware. 7. <strong>Paired Execution
Semantics and Reliability Transformers</strong>: Rely defines paired
execution semantics that pair reliable and unreliable executions to
analyze reliability. This involves reliability predicates and
transformers, allowing for reasoning about how the program’s reliability
evolves as it executes under potentially faulty hardware conditions. 8.
<strong>Related Work</strong>: The paper contrasts Rely with other
related work on approximate computing, integrity analysis, accuracy
assessment, fault tolerance/resilience, and programming abstractions for
uncertain hardware, highlighting its novelty in enabling quantitative
reliability engineering for such systems. 9.
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rely represents a significant step toward
understanding how to program systems that will likely involve some level
of unreliability due to technological advancements, allowing developers
to specify and verify acceptable levels of uncertainty in computation
outcomes.</p>

id="advanced_synchronization_techniquesforofdm_systems">Advanced_Synchronization_TechniquesforOFDM_Systems</h3>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of synchronization challenges in
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. It begins by
analyzing the impacts of timing and frequency synchronization errors on
demodulation performance at the receiver, highlighting that time
synchronization determines symbol start while frequency synchronization
aligns carrier frequencies. Errors in these areas lead to Inter-Carrier
Interference (ICI), which destroys sub-carrier orthogonality and causes
performance degradation.</p>
<p>The chapter then classifies existing synchronization techniques into
two main categories: blind (non-data aided) and data-aided approaches.
Blind methods, suitable for continuous data streams like streaming
video, exploit redundancy in cyclic prefixes without additional overhead
but typically perform poorly in frequency-selective fading channels.
Data-aided methods, preferred for burst data transmission (such as in
wireless area networks), require preambles with known sequences,
enabling more accurate estimates even in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Within data-aided techniques, various preamble structures are
utilized, such as those with alternating polarity patterns or specific
training sequence classes. Metrics like sliding correlation (low
complexity) and differential correlation (higher accuracy) are
calculated based on these preambles for synchronization purposes. The
chapter concludes by outlining the contributions of subsequent sections,
focusing on proposing novel reduced-complexity data-aided
synchronization techniques, applying them to IEEE 802.11 standards,
optimizing their performance, exploring synchronization using Zadoff-Chu
sequences, and addressing synchronization in MIMO-OFDM systems with
space-time block coding.</p>
<p>In this section, the optimization of the reduced-complexity (RC)
synchronization approach is discussed. The focus is on two main aspects:
the choice of the preamble training sub-sequence and the length of the
uncertainty interval.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Training and Correlation Sequences:
<ul>
<li>Time Domain (TD) training sequences include binary m-sequences,
Gold, Kasami, and random sequences.</li>
<li>Frequency Domain (FD) training sequences are obtained by taking the
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) of TD sequences.</li>
<li>The preamble consists of a single symbol with two identical training
sub-sequences, which can be either in TD or FD domain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optimization of Training Sequence:
<ul>
<li>The impact of different sequence types on detection accuracy is
evaluated using the CDR and estimation variance criteria for multipath
channels.</li>
<li>m-sequences, Gold sequences, Kasami sequences, and random sequences
of ±1 are compared under the same channel conditions (4 paths,
exponential power delay profile).</li>
<li>Gold sequences show better performance than other sequence types due
to their ability to avoid ghost side-peaks inherent in m-sequences.</li>
<li>Kasami sequences perform slightly better at higher SNR values
compared to Gold sequences but are limited to even values of m.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact of Training Sequence Length:
<ul>
<li>The detection accuracy improves with longer preamble lengths for all
sequence types, except for m-sequences and random sequences which
stagnate at 90% CDR for lengths below 254 samples.</li>
<li>Gold and Kasami sequences can achieve perfect detection with shorter
preambles (≥126 samples), indicating a lower complexity for the same CDR
target.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Impact of Uncertainty Interval Width:
<ul>
<li>Increasing the uncertainty interval width improves detection
accuracy up to a certain threshold after which performance degrades due
to higher probability of false peaks, especially at low SNR.</li>
<li>The optimal uncertainty interval width should balance detection
accuracy and computational load.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, this chapter highlights the importance of selecting
appropriate training sequences and uncertainty interval widths for
synchronization in OFDM systems, emphasizing the trade-offs between
performance and complexity.</p>
<p>The provided text discusses a proposed synchronization technique for
MISO-OFDM systems using Diﬀerential Alamouti STBC (D-STBC). The approach
exploits the spatial diversity offered by D-STBC to enhance
synchronization performance without requiring channel estimation at the
receiver.</p>
<p>The proposed method involves two main stages: coarse and fine
synchronization. During the coarse stage, autocorrelation is performed
on the received signal using Schmidl and Cox’s algorithm [15] to provide
a rough estimate of the preamble start time. The second, fine stage,
decodes the received signal using D-STBC and then performs
cross-correlation with the known preamble to refine the coarse estimate.
Additionally, this method also estimates the fractional frequency offset
(FFO) by examining the phase of the timing metric at the estimated time
instant.</p>
<p>Simulation results conducted on a Rayleigh fading 2x1 MISO channel
show that exploiting spatial diversity significantly improves
synchronization robustness, especially at low SNR values. Compared to a
single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM system, the proposed method
achieves a minimum gain of around 3 dB for CDR of 90% when considering
the MISO D-STBC configuration. The performance of this approach is also
compared to a coherent Alamouti STBC scheme assuming perfect channel
knowledge, demonstrating that while it incurs a 2 dB penalty, it avoids
the necessity for channel estimation, which could introduce additional
errors in practical systems.</p>
<p>In summary, this proposed synchronization technique for MISO-OFDM
systems using D-STBC effectively leverages spatial diversity to enhance
time and frequency synchronization performance without the drawback of
channel estimation required by coherent STBC schemes. The method is
robust against noise and provides satisfactory detection accuracy,
especially beneficial in low SNR conditions.</p>

id="an_agent_model_formulation_of_the_ising_model">An_Agent_Model_Formulation_of_the_Ising_Model</h3>
<p>The text discusses a novel approach to implementing the Ising model,
a well-known statistical mechanical model often used as a test problem
in computational physics, within an agent-based framework. The
traditional formulation of the Ising model deals with lattice degrees of
freedom updated via Monte Carlo procedures, focusing on equilibrating
and sampling conﬁgurations in phase space.</p>
<p>This technical note by K.A. Hawick from 2003 explores alternate and
unconventional update procedures for the Ising model and presents it as
a foundation for a spatial agent model. The paper categorizes inputs for
such an agent system into three groups: geometrically oriented state
coupling, global parameters like temperature requiring interpretation in
the update algorithm, and time or synchronization signals indicating
when agents can update their states.</p>
<p>The Ising model’s Hamiltonian (energy functional) is presented with
spin variables taking values ±1 and nearest-neighbor interactions
characterized by a coupling constant J. This constant is related to
temperature T via the Boltzmann constant kB, with critical temperatures
specified for two-dimensional square and three-dimensional cubic
lattices.</p>
<p>Hawick then outlines different methods of implementing the Ising
model, emphasizing the Monte Carlo method using algorithms like
Metropolis or Glauber updates to evolve the system in “pseudo-time.” He
also addresses challenges with simultaneous spin updates and the
detailed balance condition required by such artificially imposed
dynamics.</p>
<p>The key contribution of this work is an agent interpretation of the
Ising model, represented through a state table outlining transitions
based on energy changes due to spin flips. These transitions are either
definitive or probabilistic, conditional upon comparing a random number
generator with the change in energy, scaled by a global temperature
value. This allows for avoiding computationally expensive exponential
calculations and using a compact lookup table.</p>
<p>To tackle synchronization issues among agents, Hawick suggests
various methods, including partitioning agents into interpenetrating
lattices (like a checkerboard) or employing handshaking mechanisms to
prevent simultaneous updates by neighboring agents. He advocates for
entirely localized algorithms, where each agent determines its update
time based on local inputs and maintains an internal clock.</p>
<p>The paper concludes by summarizing the classification of agent inputs
and discussing multi-phasic updating schemes to ensure fairness and
correct computations based on valid inputs—a critical aspect of
implementing unambiguous agent-based models. This formulation offers
insights into extending agent-based methodologies to more complex
systems beyond the simple Ising model presented here.</p>
<h3 id="chapter8">Chapter8</h3>
<p>This chapter explores the relationship between network modeling and
psychometrics, focusing on the Ising model as a framework for
understanding the connections between observed variables. The Ising
model, originating from statistical physics to explain ferromagnetism,
is introduced as equivalent to certain psychometric models such as
logistic regression, loglinear models, and multi-dimensional item
response theory (MIRT).</p>
<p>The chapter begins by explaining pairwise Markov random fields
(PMRFs), which encode the independence structure of a system’s nodes
through edges representing associations. Conditional independence is
expressed when two nodes are not connected. The PMRF can be
parameterized with positive potential functions for node and pairwise
interactions, constrained to sum to zero over marginal
distributions.</p>
<p>The Ising model, specifically for binary data, represents these
potentials as logarithmic functions of thresholds (⌧i) and network
parameters (!ij), allowing for the modeling of preferences for nodes
being in certain states independently or jointly with other nodes. The
Ising model’s probability distribution is derived from the Gibbs
distribution, incorporating an inverse temperature parameter (β).</p>
<p>The chapter highlights the physical relevance of the Ising model by
discussing ferromagnetism and spontaneous magnetization, where
interactions between particles lead to macroscopic aligned behavior.
This concept extends to psychometrics, proposing that similar
synchronized effects can arise from clusters of connected psychological
variables due to their interconnectedness.</p>
<p>The relationship with loglinear analysis and logistic regression is
established by showing the conditional distribution of a node’s state
given others in the Ising model corresponds to logistic regression.
Extending PMRFs to include higher-order interactions results in
loglinear models, which are equivalent to the Ising model under specific
constraints.</p>
<p>A crucial link is made between the Ising model and MIRT,
demonstrating that an equivalent MIRT model exists with a posterior
Gaussian distribution for latent traits. The discrimination parameters
relate to eigenvectors of the Ising model’s graph structure, while
threshold parameters map to item difficulties in MIRT.</p>
<p>Estimation of the Ising model poses challenges due to the
intractability of the partition function (Z). Various methods like
maximum likelihood estimation, pseudolikelihood, and disjoint maximum
pseudolikelihood using multiple logistic regressions are discussed.
Additionally, `1-regularized optimization and elastic net regularization
are proposed for sparse network structures, addressing small sample size
issues in psychometrics.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes by introducing methods for interpreting latent
variables in psychometric models through the lens of causal versus
sampling relationships. The Ising model’s network perspective offers a
middle ground between these interpretations and suggests experimental
manipulations on nodes or connections, as well as dynamical analysis via
time series data, as ways to distinguish network from common cause
models.</p>
<p>In summary, this chapter establishes the theoretical foundations of
using network models, particularly through the Ising model, in
psychometrics, providing equivalences with existing psychometric models
and outlining estimation and interpretation methods while opening
avenues for further research and practical applications in psychological
measurement.</p>
<h3 id="decler30_final">DecLer30_final</h3>
<p>This paper presents results on the non-Gibbsianness of decimated
measures for various two-dimensional long-range Ising models and rotator
models at low temperatures. The authors extend previous findings from
simpler 2d n.n. models to more complex cases, including biaxial (very)
long-range models and isotropic long-range models with α &gt; 2.</p>
<p>The main strategy involves three steps: dividing spins into visible
and invisible subsets, conditioning on infinie subgraphs using Global
Specifications or well-defined conduction procedures, and demonstrating
a phase transition for the invisible spins under specific
conditions.</p>
<p>For long-range models, the authors utilize “Equivalence of boundary
conditions” to control long-range effects and employ energy estimates
adapted to each model. For rotator spin models, they extend Global
Specifications to two dimensions, leveraging stochastic ordering and
correlation inequalities.</p>
<p>Key results include: 1. Non-Gibbsianness for decimated measures of
biaxial n.n./very long-range (α₁ &gt; 1), bi-axial (very) long-range
models (α₁, α₂ &gt; 1), and isotropic long-range Ising models (α &gt; 2)
at low enough temperatures. 2. Decimation of anisotropic/long-range
rotator models with phase transitions in Planar and Long-Range Rotator
Models. 3. Use of Global Specifications for both Ising ferromagnets and
vector spins, extending previous results to these models. 4. A
discussion on borderline cases where the original model has no
symmetry-breaking but non-Gibbsianness can occur under certain
conditioning.</p>
<p>In a forthcoming Part II, the authors plan to address borderline
cases with potentially different phase transitions for conditioned and

evolved measures.</p>

<p>The sampling algorithm for MAX-CUT problems demonstrated in Figure
4.1 D) involves using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to map the
fully connected Ising model problem into a bipartite graph structure,
where each logical node is copied into two physical nodes: one in the
visible layer and one in the hidden layer. The coupling coefficient (C)
enforces both copies of a node to have the same value, thus preserving
the constraints of the original problem.</p>
<p>The RBM energy function is set as E(v, h) = v^TWh, with W being the
weight matrix that represents the bipartite graph’s structure. By doing
so, the lowest energy states in the Ising Model correspond to high
probability states in the RBM probability distribution.</p>
<p>Samples are then generated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm, which samples from this distribution. These stochastic
samples fluctuate through high-probability states and eventually
converge towards the lowest energy state or ground state of the MAX-CUT
problem. The solution can be interpreted in two ways: 1. Best Sample
Method: Selecting the sample with the highest probability (i.e., most
likely to represent the true solution). 2. Sampled Mode Method:
Calculating the mode (most frequent value) amongst a set of samples and
considering it as an approximation for the optimal solution.</p>
<p>The performance of these sampling methods is analyzed in Figure 4.1
E), which shows a histogram comparing both approaches on a 150-node
MAX-CUT problem with 70,000 samples and β = 0.25. The best sample method
generally performs better than the sampled mode method by a constant
factor, demonstrating its efficiency in identifying high-probability
solutions.</p>
<p>Scaling and Connectivity are also considered to understand how
algorithm performance changes with varying problem sizes and graph
embeddings. Experiments reveal that optimal coupling parameter C is
around 12 for most problem sizes in MAX-CUT problems, and varying the
number of samples affects both the probability of reaching the ground
state and the time taken to achieve sufficient quality output.</p>
<p>In summary, this section introduces direct mapping algorithms for
transforming Ising Model optimization problems into RBM structures, with
a focus on MAX-CUT problems. The algorithms utilize MCMC sampling
techniques, offering insights into how scaling, connectivity, and
coupling parameters influence algorithm performance and solution
accuracy.</p>
<p>In this section, the authors present results and discuss the
performance of parallelized GPU-based RBM algorithms using Parallel
Tempering to solve larger optimization problems, specifically focusing
on the MAX-CUT problem. They compare these results with those obtained
from a vanilla Gibbs Sampling algorithm and an FPGA-based RBM system
from the previous chapter.</p>
<p>The key findings are: 1. Parallelized GPU-based algorithms using
Parallel Tempering can find ground states of larger problems than the
vanilla Gibbs Sampling method. For instance, after 40,000 samples, the
nominal Gibbs Sampler fails to locate the ground state, whereas Parallel
Tempering successfully finds it. 2. The RBM sampler, running on a GPU
with Parallel Tempering, can achieve a ground state solution for
problems up to 2000 nodes and be within 1% of the ground state for
problems up to 7000 nodes after 40,000 samples with 500 temperatures. 3.
For the K2000 problem, the GPU-based RBM system, using Parallel
Tempering, takes approximately 120 seconds to reach a solution within 2%
of the ground state, given 40,000 samples, 500 temperatures, and a 90%
probability of reaching the ground state. 4. The authors estimate that
optimizing the code and moving to an FPGA could further improve
performance, potentially achieving at least a 10x speedup compared to
the best-known ground state solution obtained using a Toshiba Simulated
Bifurcation Machine on an FPGA. They also mention that other sampling
techniques, such as Adaptive Parallel Tempering and Adaptive Monte
Carlo, could potentially improve upon the performance of the current
systems.</p>
<p>Overall, this section demonstrates that parallelized GPU-based RBM
algorithms, utilizing techniques like Parallel Tempering, can solve
larger optimization problems than vanilla Gibbs Sampling and offer
competitive performance compared to FPGA-based systems for specific
problem instances. The results suggest potential for further performance
improvements through algorithmic optimizations and hardware
advancements.</p>
<p>This thesis presents various approaches to accelerate the solution of
Ising Model problems, which are complex optimization problems with
applications in combinatorial optimization, brain-inspired computing,
and machine learning. The work is divided into several chapters, each
focusing on different aspects of developing and applying these
acceleration techniques.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Chapter 1: Historical context and taxonomy The thesis begins by
providing historical background on Ising Model Computing and outlines
various types of accelerators that have been developed for optimization
problems, including classical and quantum approaches. The authors

offer advantages over other solutions due to leveraging probability
theory and statistics.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 2: Sampling theory and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of sampling
from complex distributions, specifically focusing on MCMC methods. The

Metropolis-Hastings, and simulated annealing, before detailing their
choice to use Blocked Gibbs Sampling and Parallel Tempering for the
RBM-based accelerators due to their efficiency and scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 3: Inverse logic for combinatorial optimization The
authors introduce a novel approach called inverse logic that merges
machine learning techniques with traditional logic design to solve
combinatorial optimization problems, such as SAT problems and number
factorization. This chapter demonstrates the correctness and convergence
properties of this merging procedure and highlights its applicability
for solving various Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs).</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 4: Direct mapping Ising Model onto Restricted Boltzmann
Machine (RBM) architecture This chapter explains how to map general
Ising Model problems onto the RBM architecture by analyzing the impact
of different parameter choices on sampler performance, including
temperature, coupling strength, and number of samples. The authors
establish a framework for mapping various Ising Model problems onto
these architectures, paving the way for future applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 5: FPGA-based acceleration The chapter focuses on
demonstrating an FPGA hardware platform capable of solving Ising Model
problems efficiently. It details the design and implementation of two
generations of RBM accelerators on FPGAs, showcasing their ability to
tackle both inference in machine learning and optimization problems
derived from Ising Models. While the second-generation accelerator could
handle larger problem sizes (up to 5000+ nodes), further algorithmic
improvements were necessary to find ground states for larger
instances.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 6: GPU and TPU-based acceleration In this chapter, the
authors explore the utilization of GPUs and TPUs for accelerating Ising
Model computations by exploiting their inherent parallelism. They
implement Parallel Tempering on both GPUs and TPUs to demonstrate their
capability of solving increasingly large and challenging problems within
reasonable timeframes. Furthermore, the chapter highlights the
successful scaling up to 100,000 nodes using a single GPU instance,
setting new records for fully connected Ising Machines with minimal
compute resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Chapter 7: Parallel Asynchronous Stochastic Sampler (PASS)
architecture The final chapter introduces PASS, an innovative stochastic
accelerator architecture capable of solving various problems beyond
optimization, such as combinatorial optimization, quantum simulation,
neural modeling, and machine learning. The design incorporates
asynchronous fine-grained neuron-level parallelism, multiplier-free
computation, and mixed signal architecture to achieve high performance
with low power consumption. The authors present several applications,
including simulated annealing for large-scale problems, emulating
quantum spin systems, and demonstrating primitive decision-making
processes in animal brains.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The concluding chapter (Chapter 8) summarizes the contributions of
this work, highlights potential future research directions such as
improved FPGA architectures supporting advanced sampling methods,
developing efficient algorithms to map real-world problems onto Ising
Machines, advancing multiplier-free machine learning techniques on
stochastic hardware, and scaling up stochastic computing platforms. The
authors aim to advance the field by bringing probabilistic accelerators
closer to practical applications in a post-Moore world characterized by
resource constraints like power and area limitations.</p>

<p>The text discusses three quantum neural network architectures
designed to estimate polynomial functionals of a quantum state without
the need for full state tomography. These architectures, named Quantum
Polynomial Network with ancilla (PolyNet-ancilla), Quantum Polynomial
Network with correlations (PolyNet-corr), and Quantum Polynomial Network
with averages (PolyNet-avg), are introduced and evaluated for their
ability to estimate properties like purity and entropy of both
discrete-variable (qubit) and continuous-variable (CV) quantum
states.</p>
<p>In the qubit case, the three architectures exhibit promising results:
1. PolyNet-ancilla demonstrates near-perfect estimation of purity and
reasonable estimation of entropy through a single-qubit circuit with an
ancilla qubit. 2. PolyNet-corr offers similar performance to
PolyNet-ancilla for purity and also shows good results for entropy
estimation by utilizing correlations between qubits. 3. While
PolyNet-avg has a higher error rate in estimating both properties, it
still presents a noteworthy approach by employing classical neural
networks on averages of qubit measurements.</p>
<p>In the continuous-variable (CV) case, the architectures face
challenges: 1. Although PolyNet-ancilla is theoretically adaptable to CV
states, practical experiments were not conducted during the writing of
the thesis. 2. Both PolyNet-corr and PolyNet-avg show degraded
performance with increasing cut-off values in the Fock space simulation,
indicating they might not generalize well to realistic CV states due to
their reliance on a finite cut-off approximation.</p>
<p>The study also outlines possible future work, such as proving the
universality of PolyNet-avg (Conjecture 1), experimenting with larger
qubit circuits, and extending the architectures to other properties and
state paradigms like continuous-variable states. Overall, this research
presents an important step toward efficient estimation of quantum state
properties using quantum neural networks, with practical implications
for near-term quantum computing applications.</p>

<h3 id="fungalcomputer_20180029.full">FungalComputer_20180029.full</h3>
<p>This paper proposes the concept of using fungi, specifically
Basidiomycetes like oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), as computing
devices. The information is represented by spikes of electrical activity
within the mycelium network and the interface is realized via fruit
bodies. Experiments demonstrate that electrical activity in fungi
responds reliably to thermal and chemical stimulation, suggesting
distant information transfer between fruit bodies.</p>
<p>The paper outlines an automaton model for a fungal computer where the
mycelium serves as a network of processors and the fruit bodies act as
the I/O interface. The state of each point in the mycelium can be
excited (w), refractory (†), or resting () based on its current state
and that of its neighbors, updated in parallel at discrete time
steps.</p>
<p>The authors experiment with Pleurotus djamor fungi, identifying
different types of spiking behavior, including large amplitude spikes
and wave-packets. They also demonstrate the ability to stimulate one
fruit and observe responses on other fruits within the same cluster,
suggesting communication between them. Additionally, changes in growth
substrate influence electrical activity, which could indicate a response
mechanism to environmental conditions.</p>
<p>In laboratory experiments using oyster mushrooms, the researchers
recorded the electrical potential of fruit bodies and found that they
exhibit spikes of electrical potential when stimulated mechanically,
chemically, or thermally. They also observed endogenous spiking
patterns, response to stimulation, and evidence of communication between
fruit bodies, supporting their theory of using fungi for computing
purposes.</p>
<p>An automaton model is then proposed to mimic the propagation of
depolarization waves in mycelium networks. This model, which has been
verified with excitable media like calcium wave propagation and heart
electrical pulse transmission, uses an array of points (representing
mycelium) connected by edges based on a quadratic function to represent
higher mycelial density near the foraging front and lower density inside
the growing disc.</p>
<p>The study demonstrates that fungal computers could be programmed by
controlling mycelium network geometry through nutritional conditions,
temperature adjustments, or physical constraints. Fungi’s slow signal
propagation speed is considered a non-critical disadvantage since they
aren’t intended to replace conventional silicon devices but rather
target large-scale environmental sensor networks for ecological
research.</p>
<p>The paper suggests that fungal computers may have applications in
areas such as soil and air quality monitoring, sensing various stimuli
(light, chemicals, gases, gravity, electric fields), and even reporting
on the health of other organisms by detecting stress hormones. Future
studies will focus on verifying automaton model results through further
experiments with fungi, exploring alternative information processing
methods like microfluidics, and developing strategies to program desired
logical circuits within mycelial networks.</p>

id="kumari-dwivedi2020_article_fundamentalconceptsofsynchroni">Kumari-Dwivedi2020_Article_FundamentalConceptsOfSynchroni</h3>
<p>This article presents an introduction to the fundamental concepts of
synchronization, its history from classical to modern times, and
applications across various fields.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>History of Synchronization</strong>: The article traces
the roots of synchronization back to 1665 when Dutch scientist
Christiaan Huygens observed two pendulum clocks hung on a common beam
synchronizing after about thirty minutes. Despite not having the right
mathematical tools at his disposal, Huygens deduced that this was due to
the weak coupling between the clocks through the beam, a phenomenon now
known as ‘anti-phase synchronization’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolution of Synchronization</strong>: Following Huygens’
discovery, synchronization observations were reported by others across
different eras and contexts – from Engelbert Kaempfer’s account of Thai
fireflies in the 1700s to John William Strutt’s experiment with organ
pipes in the late 19th century. The significance of these early
observations wasn’t fully recognized until the mid-20th century, when
radio engineers noted similar synchronization phenomena among electrical
generators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Development</strong>: The article highlights
crucial advancements in understanding synchronization mathematically. In
the 1970s, Yoshiki Kuramoto provided a technique to simplify complex
models for large sets of coupled oscillators. Later, in the early 1990s,
Pecora and Carroll’s work laid ground for chaotic synchronization
research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Importance of Studying Synchronization</strong>: The
article underscores why studying synchronization is pertinent – because
it’s ubiquitous in nature, from laser arrays to human behavior, and it
can elucidate complex system behaviors, such as those observed within
the human body or in social systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synchronization in Nature</strong>: Various examples of
synchronization are listed across different domains, ranging from
pedestrian movements on a bridge to neuronal firing in the brain. It’s
noted that not all oscillators can synchronize; only self-sustained
oscillators (periodic or chaotic) possess this capability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Sustained Oscillators</strong>: These are
characterized by their ability to maintain periodic fluctuations without
external energy input once initiated, and despite energy loss due to
dissipation, they consume energy from an external source to sustain
oscillations. Examples include pendulum clocks, biological pacemaker
cells, and electronic generators like the Vander-Pol
oscillator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Types of Synchronization</strong>: The article explains
three primary types – phase locking (frequency locking), generalized
synchronization, and lag synchronization for periodic systems; and
complete, generalized, phase, and lag synchronization for chaotic
systems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications</strong>: Synchronization finds applications
in diverse fields such as biology (neuronal networks, disease dynamics),
physics (clocks, coherent structures), defense (secure communications),
computer science (data mining, consensus problems), and social sciences
(opinion formation, finance).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Future Directions</strong>: The article concludes by
emphasizing the need for developing unified mathematical frameworks to
comprehend a broad spectrum of synchronization phenomena across various
disciplines. This would enable scientists and engineers to leverage
synchronization’s potential more effectively in solving complex
real-world problems.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, this article offers an accessible yet comprehensive
introduction to synchronization, its historical development, fundamental
principles, and wide-ranging applications, motivating further research
in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.</p>

id="neurips-2022-on-computing-probabilistic-explanations-for-decision-trees-paper-conference">NeurIPS-2022-on-computing-probabilistic-explanations-for-decision-trees-Paper-Conference</h3>
<p>This paper focuses on probabilistic explanations for decision trees,
a class of interpretable machine learning models. The authors study the
computational complexity of finding δ-sufficient reasons (δ-SR), which
are subsets of features that justify a decision tree’s classification
with probability at least δ. They prove that both minimal and minimum
δ-SR problems are NP-hard for general decision trees, even when δ is
fixed. This contrasts with the deterministic case (δ=1), where minimal
δ-SR can be computed efficiently.</p>
<p>The authors then explore structural restrictions of decision trees
that make these problems tractable:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bounded split number: If a decision tree’s split number (interaction
between subtrees and their exterior) is at most c, both minimum and
minimal δ-SR can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed c≥1.</li>
<li>Monotonicity: For monotone Boolean models where positive completions
can be counted efficiently, minimal δ-SRs can also be computed in
polynomial time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The paper further presents encodings of the Compute-Minimum-SR and
Compute-Minimal-SR problems as CNF satisfiability (SAT) instances,
enabling the use of SAT solvers for practical problem-solving even under
theoretical intractability results. The authors also provide
experimental evidence of this approach’s effectiveness on synthetic and
MNIST datasets.</p>
<p>In summary, the paper delves into the computational complexity of
probabilistic explanations for decision trees, identifies tractable
cases, and proposes practical approaches using SAT solvers to tackle
these problems in real-world scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="piis0896627322004536">PIIS0896627322004536</h3>
<p>The study investigated the functional organization of the posterior
cortex in mice during a flexible navigation task with rule switches. The
researchers used a virtual reality system to present mice with visual
cues and rewarded locations, requiring them to adapt their rules to
maximize rewards based on trial history. Eight mice were trained on this
task, with neural activity recorded from approximately 90,000 neurons
across various posterior cortical areas using two-photon calcium
imaging.</p>
<p>Key findings include: 1. Highly distributed but specialized encoding
of visual, cognitive (rule belief and choice bias), and locomotor
signals across cortical areas, rather than modular representations in
distinct areas. 2. Similar conjunctive coding of variables across
different cortical areas, suggesting a general-purpose state
representation for navigation decisions. 3. Running trajectories
reflected the within-trial dynamics of choice formation, with neural
activity predicting the mouse’s reported choice at the end of trials. 4.
Calcium imaging data revealed distinct encoding gradients for visual cue
identity (strongest in V1 and neighboring areas), spatial
position/dynamics (strongest in RSC), and locomotion (stronger in area
A). 5. Encoding of most variables was highly distributed, with cue and
movement encoding closer to a fully distributed than modular
organization compared to other cognitive variables like decision-making
strategy. 6. Single-neuron encoding profiles confirmed functional
gradients while demonstrating that the majority of neurons had encoding
profiles compatible with multiple areas. 7. Analysis of conjunctive
structure in single neurons showed similar correlation patterns across
posterior cortical areas, implying generic integration rather than
specialized integration based on area. 8. High-dimensional
representations for variable conjunctions were present across areas,
indicating a potential role for the posterior cortex in integrating
diverse variables into a flexible state representation used by
downstream circuits for navigation decisions.</p>
<p>The study challenges traditional notions of functional hierarchy and
modularity within the posterior cortex, proposing instead that this area
generates high-dimensional, general-purpose representations crucial for
guiding flexible navigation decisions, with distinct input modalities
processed in parallel without hierarchical organization.</p>
<p>The text describes a series of quantitative analyses performed on
neural data from the posterior cortex of mice during a spatial
navigation task. The goal is to understand how different brain areas
encode various variables related to the task. Here’s a detailed
breakdown:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Distributedness Quantification:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two models are used to measure the distributedness of encoding
across different brain areas:
<ul>
<li><strong>Random Fraction Model</strong>: This model varies between
0.01 and 1, with each value representing a different level of
distributedness. For each fraction, the normalized mutual information
(NMI) between area labels and encoding ranks is calculated 100 times to
obtain an average NMI vs. random fraction curve.</li>
<li><strong>Jitter Model</strong>: This model adds Gaussian noise
(jitter) to the rank of encoding strengths, with standard deviations
ranging from 0.1 to 5. The NMI between area labels and perturbed ranks
is calculated 100 times for each jitter value, generating an average NMI
vs. jitter curve.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These models provide complementary insights: the random fraction
model offers a clear bounded range for distributedness, while the jitter
model generates synthetic distributions similar to empirical ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Single Variable Encoding:</strong>
<ul>
<li>For each selected variable (e.g., cue, maze position, reported
choice), active neurons are identified based on epoch-averaged null
deviance.</li>
<li>1000 active neurons per area are subsampled, and their encoding
strengths are rank-transformed and NMI is calculated with respect to
area labels, normalized against a fully modular model.</li>
<li>This process is repeated 1000 times to compute mean and standard
error of NMI, enabling the determination of an “equivalent random
fraction” or “equivalent jitter” for each variable by finding the
corresponding value that matches the mean NMI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Complementary Decoding Approach:</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to mutual information-based methods, “max vs. others”
decoding is performed using logistic regression: neurons with the
highest encoding strength in a chosen area (e.g., V1 for cue) are
decoded against all other areas.</li>
<li>Area under the ROC curve (auROC) is reported as an alternative
measure of distributedness, where auROC = 1 indicates full modularity
and 0.5 indicates full distribution.</li>
<li>This approach is also repeated 1000 times with subsampling of 1000
neurons per area to calculate mean and standard error.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Decoding Anatomical Locations from Encoding
Profiles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To relate a neuron’s encoding properties to its anatomical location,
logistic regression decoders are trained on cortical locations using the
neuron’s GLM-derived encoding profile across various trial epochs and
behavioral variables.</li>
<li>These decoders form a grid over posterior cortex and predict the
presence of neurons at different grid points based on their encoding
profiles.</li>
<li>Cross-validation is performed to ensure model robustness, and
predictions are normalized across all decoders to create probability
distributions over cortical space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of Decoded
Locations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NMF is applied to the matrix of predicted neuron locations by
location decoders, aiming to approximate this high-dimensional data with
fewer components (factors).</li>
<li>With k=3 factors, 34% reconstruction error is achieved, suggesting a
relatively low-dimensional representation of cortical space in terms of
neuronal encoding profiles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Linear Embedding of Single Neuron Encoding
Profiles:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Principal component analysis (PCA) on location decoder coefficients
identifies the most relevant dimensions for differentiating neuron
locations in encoding space.</li>
<li>A 2D embedding is constructed using the first two principal
components, and kernel smoothing generates empirical densities to
visualize clustering of neurons from specific areas.</li>
<li>Dendrograms are created based on Euclidean distances between
centroids of all neurons from different areas in the full-dimensional
encoding space to capture similarities in encoding patterns across
areas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conjunctive Structure Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Correlation between encoding strength of pairs of variables is
computed after removing spatial differences in average encoding strength
and considering only active neurons for each epoch.</li>
<li>Pearson correlation is then calculated for neuron pairs within
individual areas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Decoding Area Based on Encoding Correlations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Area labels are decoded using interaction terms between single
variable encodings, linear terms of individual variables, or a
combination thereof.</li>
<li>Logistic regression with leave-one-mouse-out cross validation is
employed to assess decoding performance (auROC).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Shattering Dimensionality for Conjunctive
Variables:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A modified procedure from Bernardi et al. (2020) is used to quantify
dimensionality of population representations for conjunctive conditions
formed by multiple variables:
<ul>
<li>Variables are discretized into bins, and balanced dichotomies are
constructed.</li>
<li>Linear SVMs decode these dichotomies from population activity, with
average classification accuracy reported as “shattering
dimensionality.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hierarchical bootstrap is used to resample neurons by area for
statistical significance testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dimensionality of Encoding Across Neurons vs. Cortical
Space:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Analyses compare the dimensionality of encoding across individual
neurons (using GLM coefficients and encoding strengths) versus across
cortical space (using location decoder outputs).</li>
<li>Principal component analysis shows that encoding across cortical
space requires significantly fewer dimensions to explain variance
compared to encoding across neurons, suggesting a reduction in
dimensionality from neuronal representations to spatial maps.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These analyses provide a comprehensive approach to understanding how
different brain areas encode various aspects of a complex behavioral
task, shedding light on the organization and functional specialization
within posterior cortex.</p>

<p>The provided material is a supplement to the paper “The formal
schooling niche: Longitudinal evidence from Bolivian Amazon demonstrates
that higher school quality augments differences in children’s abstract
reasoning.” The study examines the impact of formal schooling (FS)
quality on children’s abstract reasoning skills among the Tsimane, an
indigenous group in the Bolivian Amazon. Here’s a detailed summary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Introduction and Background</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Formal education is seen as crucial for social and economic growth
but its effects on cognition remain unclear.</li>
<li>This study investigates how FS quality influences abstract reasoning
in the Tsimane, who are transitioning to a market economy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Methodology</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The researchers collected data from 290 Tsimane children aged 8-18
years over four years (n=184 for longitudinal analysis).</li>
<li>They assessed school quality using 11 items, including teacher
training, student-teacher ratio, and resources. Schools were classified
into high, medium, or low quality based on these factors.</li>
<li>Children’s abstract reasoning was measured using Raven’s Colored

<li><strong>Key Findings</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Higher quality schools were associated with higher RCPM scores at
baseline and greater age-related improvements over time in longitudinal

id="random_field_ising_chains_with_synchronous_dynamic">Random_Field_Ising_Chains_with_Synchronous_Dynamic</h3>
<p>The paper presents an exact solution for the one-dimensional Random
Field Ising Model (RFIM) with synchronous dynamics instead of
sequential. The equilibrium state’s characteristics are determined by a
temperature-dependent pseudo-Hamiltonian, adapted from techniques
originally developed for the sequential (Glauber) dynamics RFIM.
Although deriving the solution is more involved in this model compared
to the sequential one, the authors prove rigorously that the physics of
both RFIM versions are asymptotically identical.</p>
<p>Key aspects of their study include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Model Definitions</strong>: The authors define a system
of N Ising spins arranged in a one-dimensional chain, with synchronous
alignment to local fields instead of sequential updates. The dynamics is
controlled by the parameter Ɛ = k_B T, where k_B is the Boltzmann
constant and T is temperature. Spin interactions (J_ij) and external
fields (h_i(t)) are drawn from specified distributions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Markov Chain Definition</strong>: They define a Markov
chain that describes spin evolution through (5), which can reach a
unique stationary distribution p̃(σ). This equilibrium state obeys
detailed balance only if J_ij = J_ji for all pairs (i, j).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pseudo-Hamiltonian</strong>: Due to the non-Gibbsian
equilibrium distribution resulting from synchronous dynamics,
conventional thermodynamic relations no longer hold. A
pseudo-Hamiltonian H̃(σ) is introduced as a generating function for
equilibrium averages, which depends on Ɛ and lacks its usual
thermodynamic significance (6).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relevant Macroscopic Observables</strong>: The authors
focus on macroscopic observables like overall magnetization m, alignment
with random fields u, and the next-time/nearest-neighbour correlation
function a, defined using equilibrium averages calculated via the
Boltzmann distribution with pseudo-Hamiltonian H̃(σ) (7–8).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connection to Sequential Dynamics</strong>: Despite the
more complex stochastic process in terms of three ratios of conditioned
partition functions, authors show that asymptotically, expectation
values of local magnetizations for both sequential and parallel dynamics
become identical (14). They also examine Devil’s Staircase shapes for
integrated probability densities of relevant observables and calculate
ground state entropy, which exhibits non-trivial behavior as a function
of the random field strength (15–17).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The main novelty in this work is the study of disordered spin chains
with synchronous dynamics, an alternative to more common sequential
dynamics RFIM models. The authors demonstrate that although the
methodology for deriving solutions is more involved, the physics of both
versions remain asymptotically identical, enabling recovery of known
Devil’s Staircase features and ground state entropy characteristics.</p>
<p>This text presents an analysis of a specific statistical mechanical
model featuring random fields and synchronous dynamics over an infinite
range of interactions. The model’s complexity arises from the
combination of short-range connectivity, random external fields, and
non-Boltzmann equilibrium states generated by synchronous dynamics
rather than sequential Glauber dynamics.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Model Overview</strong>:
<ul>
<li>It considers an Ising-like model with spin variables represented as
(m, u, a), where m denotes the global magnetization, u and a are
auxiliary fields.</li>
<li>Random fields (~r_i) are incorporated, and synchronous dynamics
replace the usual sequential Glauber dynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Infinite Range Version</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The model’s infinite-range version is obtained by replacing
nearest-neighbor interactions (J_ij = J for |i-j| ≤ θ) with uniform,
rescaled interactions (J_ij = J/N).</li>
<li>This allows separation of effects from random fields and synchronous
dynamics from those arising due to short-range interaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Free Energy Calculation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The authors derive the free energy per spin by combining energy
expression (Eq. (Ψ)) with the partition function (Z) and including the
effect of random fields via Δ = ∫ dm ν[m - m(σ)].</li>
<li>This leads to an integral over (m, ^m), solved numerically using
gradient descent for N → ∞, yielding a saddle-point formulation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Saddle-Point Equations</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Three coupled nonlinear equations arise from differentiating the
saddle-point function with respect to m, u, and a:
<ul>
<li>m = G_J(G_J(m))</li>
<li>u = ~r - Δ * [tanh(μ(Jm + r))]</li>
<li>a = m * sign(J)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Solution Analysis</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The simpler set of equations (Eq. Λ) is shown to be the unique
solution for the saddle-point equations.</li>
<li>This uniqueness follows from properties of G_J(m), which is
antisymmetric and monotonic with specific sign behavior depending on J’s
sign.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Free Energy Expression</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The expression for asymptotic free energy per spin (Eq. Ω) is
derived, showing it to be twice that of a standard sequential Glauber
mean-field system due to vanishing global magnetization fluctuations in
the thermodynamic limit.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Phase Distribution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The probability distribution over macroscopic magnetizations
simplifies to a delta function due to N → ∞, indicating a highly ordered
state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bifurcation Analysis and Phase Diagram</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the saddle-point equations (Eq. Φ) via bifurcation
analysis yields a phase diagram characterized by different regions:
<ul>
<li>Paramagnetic phase with m = 0 for J ≈ 0.</li>
<li>Ferromagnetic phase with two m ≠ 0 fixed points for large positive
J.</li>
<li>A phase with stable limit cycles (oscillatory magnetization) for
large negative J.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intermediate regions exhibit coexistence of locally stable m = 0 and
m ≠ 0 states, where initial conditions dictate the final state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Evolution</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Despite fixed points in the synchronous dynamics (Eq. Π) mirroring
those of a sequential system, stability properties can differ
significantly.</li>
<li>For J &lt; 0 and low temperatures, the system settles into stable
periodic limit cycles instead of converging to m = 0 as a sequential
model would.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The analysis of this infinite-range model with synchronous dynamics
provides detailed insights into phase transitions, bifurcations, and
dynamical behavior not captured by standard mean-field models with
asynchronous updates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The text presents an analysis of a spin chain model with synchronous
dynamics, short-range interactions, and random external fields. The
system’s behavior is categorized into three regions based on the
stability of different spin states (m=0 or m≠0). Transitions between
these regions are either continuous or discontinuous, depending on the
nature of the transitions.</p>
<p>In region (i), the paramagnetic phase, spins tend to align with
random fields, maintaining a non-zero average u. Regions (ii) and (iii)
represent areas where m≠0 fixed points are locally stable. For J&gt;0,
these m≠0 states signify ferromagnetic macroscopic fixed points, while
for J&lt;0, the system evolves into a stable period-doubling
oscillation, or β-cycle.</p>
<p>The model exhibits ergodicity-breaking phenomena, especially evident
when dealing with anti-ferromagnetic exchange interactions inducing
periodic oscillations instead of an anti-ferromagnetic state. This
requires careful handling of such systems. In this particular model,
ergodic components with both positive and negative values of m are found
at sufficiently low temperatures for J&lt;0.</p>
<p>Focusing on short-range interactions and non-random fields, the text
adapts transfer matrix formalism to accommodate a pseudo-Hamiltonian.
For synchronous dynamics in a d-dimensional spin chain with nearest
neighbor interactions and uniform (but random) external fields, the
partition function Z_N is calculated, leading to expressions for free
energy per spin (f). The free energy expression depends on the largest
eigenvalue λ+ of the transfer matrix T_sync, which connects this model
to conventional equilibrium systems in the thermodynamic limit.</p>
<p>The magnetization m and next-time nearest-neighbor correlation
function a are derived from the free energy f, following standard
generating functions techniques. For synchronous dynamics, these results
match those obtained from sequential Glauber dynamics, suggesting
consistency between the two approaches.</p>
<p>When considering open boundary conditions, the calculations become
slightly more complex due to boundary terms, but similar
eigenvalue-based expressions for free energy and correlation functions
can be derived. The transfer matrix T_sync is shown to relate directly
to the conventional sequential Glauber dynamics’ transfer matrix T_seq
through the identity T_sync = T_seq^T, explaining why the synchronous
dynamics free energy (f) is twice that of sequential dynamics.</p>
<p>Finally, for the complete model with random fields and open boundary
conditions, an adapted RFIM technique is proposed to compute the
partition function Z_N. This involves adding one extra spin to the chain
and tracking the states of the last two spins through a Markovian
stochastic map. The solution employs conditional partition functions
Z_N;?? that depend on the states of the last two spins, leading to
recursive relations involving random matrices M±[r_N+ε; r_N] which
encapsulate the system’s synchronization dynamics and random field
effects.</p>
<p>The text describes a four-dimensional stochastic process generated by
random matrices M[θ_N + δ, θ_N], with the stationary state leading to
the free energy per spin. The conditional partition functions k(ε),
k(δ), and k(γ) are defined to help evaluate this, and it’s shown that if
k(ε) = k(γ), then k(ε) remains constant for all n ≥ δ. This simplifies
the equations significantly.</p>
<p>The stochastic process (χ) is derived using these ratios, represented
as a Markovian process for a single random variable kn ≡ k(ε)n:</p>
<p>kn+δ = [kn; θn+δ; θn] * [k0; θ; θ0] = cosh[β~θ] +
e^(-βθ_0)k0cosh[β(θ_n - J)]cosh[β(θ_n + J)] / (cosh[β~θ] +
e^(-βθ_0)k0)</p>
<p>In terms of probability densities, the stochastic process is
equivalently written as:</p>
<p>Pi+δ(k) = ∑_θ;θ0 Z(δ) [k - χ[k; θ; θ0]] Pi(k0)</p>
<p>Assuming ergodicity and a unique stationary state P∞(k), the
stationary density can be written as the limit of time averages over
non-random realizations of random fields. Special cases are provided for
benchmark scenarios, such as no external fields or interactions, and
non-random external fields.</p>
<p>The free energy per spin (f_ε) is expressed in terms of the
stationary distribution P∞(k):</p>
<p>f_ε = -lim_N→∞ [βN log Z_“”] = -lim_N→∞ [βN log (e^(-βθ_N) k_N(γ)
Z_N;#” / Z_N;“)]</p>
<p>The conditional partition functions are inverted using k(γ) = k(ε),
leading to expressions for Z_N;“#, Z_N;##, and Z_N;”“. These quantities
are bounded due to the strict positivity of k(ε)n, ensuring that the
mapping [k; :] always falls within the interval [k_low; k_up], with
k_low = k_−δ = cosh[β(~θ + J)]. This allows expressing f_ε solely in
terms of P∞(k).</p>
<p>Lastly, local observables like magnetization hσi and next-nearest
neighbor correlations are expressed in terms of the conditional
partition functions. The symmetry property i[σi-δ; σi; σi+δ] = i[σi+δ;
σi; σi-δ] enables writing these local observables in terms of two
subchains, originating from left and right sides of the original N-spin
chain, with lengths <code>and (N -</code> + δ), respectively. The final
expressions involve ratios k(n)_<code>and k(n)_N−</code>+δ, derived
using earlier conditional partition functions.</p>
<p>The text discusses a stochastic process underlying both synchronous
and sequential dynamics in a random-field Ising model (RFIM). It
highlights the link between these two processes through an identity that
connects their transition probabilities, ultimately leading to
equivalent stationary distributions for the random variable k. This
equivalence is demonstrated for both mean-field and non-random field
cases, as well as for uniform external fields in short-range
random-field models.</p>
<p>The analysis further delves into the Devil’s Staircase phenomenon
observed in sequential dynamics for certain parameter ranges. It
explains that synchronous dynamics’ stationary distribution is identical
to that of sequential dynamics due to the established link between their
stochastic processes. The paper then presents a method to construct the
Devil’s Staircase for the RFIM by applying a recursive operator on the
integrated probability distribution function.</p>
<p>As the ratio of random field intensity (~r) to coupling constant (J)
increases, the support of the stationary distribution changes from a
connected interval to a Canter set with a fractal dimension less than
one. The graphical representation of this transition showcases distinct
branches corresponding to intervals with positive and negative k
values.</p>
<p>In summary, the text explores the relationship between synchronous
and sequential dynamics in random-field models, proves their equivalence
through stochastic processes, and demonstrates how Devil’s Staircase
emerges in these models as a function of model parameters. This work
provides valuable insights into the complex behavior of disordered
magnetic systems and their connections to fractal geometry and chaos
theory.</p>
<p>This text discusses the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) with
synchronous dynamics, addressing its equilibrium distribution, free
energy, entropy, and ground state degeneracy. Here’s a detailed summary
and explanation of key points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Model Description</strong>: The RFIM consists of spins on
a lattice that interact ferromagnetically (preferred alignment) or
antiferromagnetically (opposed alignment). Random fields are added to
each spin, introducing disorder. In this study, the dynamics are
synchronous, meaning all spins update simultaneously at each time
step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equilibrium Distribution</strong>: Péretto’s
pseudo-Hamiltonian is employed to characterize the equilibrium
distribution. This Hamiltonian incorporates both spin interactions and
random fields, making it temperature-dependent. The equilibrium
distribution is derived using an adaptation of techniques originally
developed for the sequential dynamics RFIM.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Autonomous Stochastic Relations</strong>: For synchronous
dynamics, one must condition on the states of the last two spins rather
than just the last one to derive autonomous stochastic relations. This
results in a more complex Markovian stochastic map for three ratios
(k_α, k_β, k_γ) of conditioned partition functions instead of just one
ratio as in sequential dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equivalence of Sequential and Synchronous
Dynamics</strong>: Despite the complexity introduced by the synchronous
dynamics, it is proven that the physics of both RFIM versions
(sequential vs synchronous) are asymptotically identical. This
equivalence is demonstrated by reducing the number of relevant ratios in
the synchronous case to a single ratio ‘k’ and showing that double
iteration of the sequential dynamics Markov process equals single
iteration of the synchronous dynamics process derived here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase Transition and Devil’s Staircase</strong>: The
study recovers phases where the integrated densities of local
magnetizations and nearest-neighbor spin correlations exhibit a familiar
Devil’s Staircase form as a function of temperature (or a normalized
variable). For synchronous dynamics, this occurs for specific parameter
choices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entropy and Ground State Degeneracy</strong>: The entropy
per spin is shown to be nonzero for ~r = J &lt; 1 and features an
infinite series of transitions at ~r = J = 1/r (where r = ϵ, θ, …). As
the temperature approaches zero, these peaks sharpen, leading to
infinitely sharp delta-like spikes in entropy per spin. This behavior
signifies a high degree of frustration in the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-standard Thermodynamics</strong>: Due to the
temperature dependence of the pseudo-Hamiltonian, standard thermodynamic
relations do not hold straightforwardly. The ground state entropy, for
instance, is dependent on ~r = J as an infinite series of
singularities.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this paper presents a detailed analysis of the Random
Field Ising Model under synchronous dynamics, offering insights into its
equilibrium distribution, free energy, entropy, and ground state
degeneracy. The study reveals complex behaviors similar to those
observed in sequential RFIM versions, contributing significantly to our
understanding of equilibrium states induced by sequential versus
parallel dynamics in Ising spin systems.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the use of coupled VO2-based oscillators to
solve combinatorial optimization problems, specifically mapping these
problems to an Ising model and solving them through synchronization
dynamics of the system. The research focuses on analyzing factors that
impact the probability of reaching the ground state (optimum solution)
for the corresponding optimization problem.</p>
<p>The authors propose a novel Second-Harmonic Injection Locking (SHIL)
schedule, characterized by periodically increasing and decreasing SHIL
signal amplitude, as a mechanism to escape from local minimum energy
states in the system. This approach is supported by simulation-based
analysis showing better success probability compared to previous
methods. An experimental Oscillatory Ising Machine (OIM) was built to
validate their proposal.</p>
<p>Key findings include: 1. VO2 devices, exhibiting metal-insulator
transitions under specific electrical stimuli, were used as compact and
low-energy oscillators for coupled oscillator networks. 2. The
synchronization dynamics of these coupled oscillator systems enabled
solving Ising models, which in turn can represent various combinatorial
optimization problems. 3. The novel SHIL schedule was developed to help
the system escape local minimum energy states by gradually increasing
and decreasing the injection locking signal amplitude. 4. Simulation and
hardware experiments showed improved success probabilities when using
the proposed SHIL schedule compared to existing approaches. 5.
Experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the OIM approach,
validating the effectiveness of the novel SHIL scheduling for solving
optimization problems via phase-transition devices.</p>
<p>This research contributes to the understanding and implementation of
energy-efficient Ising machines using coupled oscillator networks based
on VO2 devices, offering a promising alternative for hardware platforms
addressing computationally hard problems in various fields such as

<li><p><strong>The Brain’s Master Clock:</strong> The text discusses
Norbert Wiener’s hypothesis about a master clock mechanism in the brain,
which coordinates neural activities. According to Wiener, this master
clock would be made up of millions of individual oscillators (possibly
neurons or small clusters thereof), each with its own natural frequency
that could vary. These oscillators would synchronize their rhythms
through a process of frequency pulling—where slower oscillators are sped
up and faster ones slowed down by influences from other
oscillators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wiener’s Predictions and Approach:</strong> Wiener
envisioned that such a synchronization mechanism could be identified in
the alpha rhythm, a prominent brain wave pattern observed during
relaxation with eyes closed. He predicted a peculiar signature in the
alpha rhythm’s frequency spectrum—a peak flanked by dips at both lower
and higher frequencies. To test this, Wiener proposed using magnetic
tape recording for brain wave measurement, allowing for more precise
calculation of the spectrum via electronic processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenges in Proving Wiener’s Hypothesis:</strong>
Despite the initial enthusiasm around his ideas, Wiener struggled to
prove his hypothesis mathematically due to the complexity introduced by
continuous interactions between oscillators and variations in their
natural frequencies. His approach required a sophisticated model capable
of capturing these nuances, which proved challenging with existing
mathematical tools at that time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Art Winfree’s Contributions:</strong> Art Winfree later
addressed some of Wiener’s limitations by developing a more
comprehensive model for biological oscillators. Instead of just focusing
on frequency, Winfree’s model took into account the phase of an
oscillator’s cycle—representing different stages of its internal
activity (e.g., neuron firing in a brain or hormonal changes in a
menstrual cycle).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winfree’s Model and Frequency Pulling:</strong> Winfree
introduced influence and sensitivity functions to describe how an
oscillator responds to signals from others based on its current phase in
the cycle. These functions allowed for nuanced interactions between
oscillators, capturing both the pushing (influence) and pulling
(sensitivity) dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winfree’s Simulations:</strong> Winfree used computer
simulations to explore his model under various settings of influence and
sensitivity functions. He observed three distinct scenarios: complete
incoherence where no synchronization occurred, partial synchronization
with a mixture of synchronized, desynchronized, and unsynchronized
groups, and full coherence or perfect synchronization when the
population was sufficiently homogeneous (narrow bell curve).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yoshiki Kuramoto’s Breakthrough:</strong> Building on
Winfree’s work, Yoshiki Kuramoto devised a simpler yet powerful
analytical approach to model oscillator populations. His model featured
symmetrical interaction rules based on frequency differences and
coupling strengths. Kuramoto solved the system of nonlinear differential
equations governing his model exactly, providing quantitative measures
for synchronization (order parameter) and revealing conditions under
which synchronization emerges or fails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Significance of Kuramoto’s Work:</strong> Kuramoto’s work
connected the fields of nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechanics by
applying techniques from statistical physics to study time-varying
systems like oscillating biological entities. His model laid the
groundwork for understanding phase transitions in synchronization,
linking Wiener’s vision with rigorous mathematical
underpinnings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, this section explores Norbert Wiener’s pioneering idea of
a master clock mechanism in the brain through frequency-pulling
oscillators and how later researchers like Art Winfree and Yoshiki
Kuramoto refined these ideas into more sophisticated models capable of
accounting for complex oscillator dynamics, eventually leading to
precise analytical solutions for synchronization in populations.</p>
<p>The text describes several instances where synchronization (sync) is
observed across diverse systems, ranging from biological processes
within organisms to technological advancements and even celestial
mechanics. It highlights that sync isn’t limited to living entities but
is a fundamental property inherent in the universe, arising from the
laws of physics and mathematics rather than evolution or
intelligence.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Biological Clocks</strong>: In humans, circadian rhythms
control various physiological processes like sleep-wake cycles, hormone
secretion, alertness, digestion, dexterity, and cognitive performance.
These rhythms are organized in a hierarchical manner similar to an
orchestra, with cells within organs synchronized, different organs
displaying periodic activities with the same period (but not necessarily
at the same time), and all entrained to the 24-hour day due to
light-dark cycles acting as a reference for synchronization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time Isolation Experiments</strong>: Researchers like
Michel Siffre, who lived in total darkness, confirmed that humans
maintain a roughly 24-hour internal clock, even without external cues.
Despite attempts to manipulate this through staying up late, they found
that sleep duration followed mathematical patterns rather than
randomness when viewed relative to their body temperature
cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Desynchronization and Its Consequences</strong>: Some
subjects in controlled time isolation experiments showed spontaneous
internal desynchronization, with their sleep-wake cycles deviating from
their 24-hour rhythm, but still maintaining a consistent relationship
within themselves. This desynchronization has been observed in shift
workers, leading to performance issues and increased risk of industrial
accidents during certain hours due to what is termed the “zombie zone”
of low alertness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of Synchronization</strong>: Conditions like delayed
sleep phase syndrome suggest that individuals with intrinsic circadian
periods slightly different from 24 hours struggle in societies with a
fixed 24-hour schedule, highlighting the broader societal impacts of
synchronization issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technological Applications</strong>: The discovery and
understanding of sync have led to advancements like laser technology,
which is crucial for various applications ranging from medical
procedures (like eye surgery) to consumer electronics. Lasers rely on
the principle of stimulated emission, where light waves are synchronized
and amplified by resonant cavities or echo chambers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Power Grid Synchronization</strong>: The American power
grid ensures the reliable distribution of alternating current across
vast distances through a system of interconnected generators that must
operate in sync to prevent power surges and potential equipment
damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Astronomical Synchronicity</strong>: Examples like
orbital resonance between planets (such as certain moons around Jupiter)
or the synchronization of Earth’s moon with its rotation demonstrate
cosmic-scale synchrony, influencing tides and maintaining a locked face
towards Earth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quantum Mechanics and Sync</strong>: On a quantum scale,
electrons in superconductivity display synchronization, forming Cooper
pairs that behave like bosons rather than fermions due to their pairing.
This allows for zero electrical resistance below certain temperatures,
an application with potential benefits including lossless power
transmission and magnetic levitation transportation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tunneling Supercurrent</strong>: Brian Josephson’s
groundbreaking prediction described how a superconducting current could
tunnel through an insulating barrier without external stimuli,
challenging classical physics notions of resistance. Although initially
met with skepticism, subsequent experimental confirmation validated his
work, illustrating sync at the subatomic level and paving the way for
future technological innovations in quantum computing and more.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the text underlines that synchronization is a fundamental
principle underlying diverse phenomena across scales—from cellular
rhythms to cosmic mechanics—reflecting a deep, perhaps universal
organizational law of nature.</p>
<p>The text discusses the phenomenon of synchronized chaos, where two
chaotic systems synchronize with each other despite the belief that two
chaotic systems cannot synchronize due to the butterfly effect. This
misconception was dispelled when physicists realized that certain
universal laws govern the transition from regular to chaotic behavior in
various systems. The Millennium Bridge fiasco serves as an example of
this, where pedestrians walking in sync unintentionally caused lateral
wobbling due to their sideways forces adding up instead of canceling
out.</p>
<p>The chaos revolution began with Edward Lorenz’s work on the Lorenz
equations, which generate seemingly random yet deterministic chaotic
behavior. Initially overlooked, these equations gained attention as
various fields stumbled upon manifestations of chaos in their systems,
such as wildlife population dynamics, planetary motion, and even mundane
phenomena like voltage oscillations in electrical circuits.</p>
<p>Chaos theory is characterized by seemingly random behavior governed
by nonrandom laws, appearing disordered on the surface but harboring
cryptic patterns and rigid rules. Chaotic systems exhibit sensitive
dependence on initial conditions—the butterfly effect—rendering
long-term prediction impossible due to exponential growth of errors in
measurements. The essence of chaos lies in a new kind of order: strange
attractors, geometric shapes residing in state space that chaotic
trajectories are confined to, exhibiting unpredictable detail but
constant overall character.</p>
<p>Lou Pecora and Tom Carroll sought to harness chaos for practical
applications, particularly in secure communication. They developed a
synchronization scheme using two copies of a chaotic system: one as the
driver (transmitter) and the other as the receiver. By driving the
receiver with a chaotic signal from a duplicate of itself, they managed
to synchronize their systems despite the butterfly effect’s
influence.</p>
<p>Kevin Cuomo later demonstrated practical chaos-based encryption by
masking messages within electrical chaos generated by Lorenz circuits.
This method, called chaotic encryption, masks messages by adding them to
a noisy chaotic signal, ensuring that only the intended receiver can
extract the original message due to synchronization.</p>
<p>Despite initial optimism about chaotic encryption’s potential for
secure communications, later work revealed its weaknesses compared to
existing methods. Nonetheless, synchronized chaos has deepened our
understanding of synchrony as a more pervasive and subtle phenomenon
than previously thought. Research into this area continues in pursuit of
practical applications and further insights into the nature of sync in
complex systems.</p>
<p>The text delves into various aspects of synchronization, a phenomenon
observed across diverse fields including biology, physics, and social
sciences. Here’s a summary of key points along with explanations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Human Aspects of Synchronization</strong>: The human side
of synchronization includes fads, mob behavior, political movements, and
even musical enjoyment. These phenomena are influenced by complex
interpersonal dynamics that are still poorly understood mathematically
due to the intricacies involved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical Models of Synchronization</strong>: Simple
models have been developed to explain synchronization, particularly in
oscillator networks. However, extending these to real-world human
interactions has proven challenging because human behavior is not as
predictable or uniform as that of oscillators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Small-World Networks</strong>: This theory posits that
most networks, whether social, biological, or technological, exhibit
small-world characteristics: short average path lengths for connection
and high clustering coefficients. Examples include the brain’s neural
networks, power grids, Hollywood actors’ collaboration networks, and
even language connections in English.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scale-Free Networks</strong>: In these networks, a few
nodes (often called “hubs”) have many more connections than most other
nodes, following a power law distribution. This pattern has been
observed in the World Wide Web, where some pages receive thousands of
links while others have none.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Origin and Significance of Small-World and Scale-Free
Patterns</strong>: While not fully understood, these patterns suggest an
underlying organizing principle in complex systems, possibly indicating
that evolution or other processes favor networks with these structures
due to their robustness against random failures but vulnerability to
attacks targeting hubs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social Contagion and Fads</strong>: The text references
Alan Alda’s interest in understanding how fads spread, likening it to
the synchronization of oscillators. Despite extensive study by
sociologists and psychologists, a detailed mathematical theory
explaining the dynamics of fads remains elusive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Traffic Flow Dynamics</strong>: Traffic congestion is
another area where synchronization plays out. Contrary to intuition,
models show that even with selfish drivers focused on their own optimal
speeds, synchronized traffic patterns can emerge, illustrating how group
behavior can lead to collective efficiency under the right
conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crowd Behavior and Synchronization</strong>: Experiments
and simulations suggest that audiences clapping in unison exhibit a form
of synchronization, but this comes at a psychological cost as it reduces
overall noise levels, presenting an example where group synchrony has
both beneficial (harmony) and detrimental (reduced expressiveness)
aspects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Human Brain Synchronization</strong>: Research indicates
that synchronized neural activity is linked to cognitive functions like
memory and perception. While controversial, these findings suggest that
brain synchrony might be integral to how the mind works, possibly even
playing a role in consciousness itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Future of Nonlinear Dynamics and Complex
Systems</strong>: The text hints at the potential for synchronization
theory to serve as a foundational concept for understanding more complex
human systems, including genetics, social organizations, economies, and
ecosystems. However, it acknowledges that we are still far from a
comprehensive theoretical framework due to the intricate nature of these
systems.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The exploration of synchronization underscores the interconnectedness
of diverse fields and hints at fundamental principles governing complex
systems’ behavior across scales. It represents an exciting yet
challenging frontier for scientific inquiry, potentially offering
insights into organizational patterns across nature and society.</p>
<p>The book discussed is “Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous
Order” by Steven Strogatz. It explores the phenomenon of synchronization
across various fields such as physics, biology, social sciences, and
even technology.</p>
<p>Key topics include: - Synchronization in nature (e.g., fireflies
flashing in unison, brain waves) - Mathematical models explaining
synchronization, including those developed by Arthur Winfree and Yoshiki
Kuramoto - Applications in human sleep studies, particularly the work of
Charles Czeisler on circadian rhythms - The role of chaos theory in
understanding complex systems, featuring Edward Lorenz’s butterfly
effect - Synchronized chaotic systems and their potential applications
in communications technology - Small-world networks - a mix of
regularity and randomness observed in diverse systems like power grids,
the internet, and social networks - The human side of synchronization,
including fads, collective behavior, and neuroscience aspects -
Historical examples and anecdotes to illustrate the universality of
synchrony across different scales and domains.</p>
<p>The author, Steven Strogatz, interweaves scientific explanations with
engaging narratives about pioneers in the field, including personal
accounts and historical context, making complex concepts accessible to a
broad audience while retaining scientific rigor. The book’s overarching
theme emphasizes how spontaneous order can emerge from local
interactions among disparate elements, regardless of whether these
elements are physical particles, neurons, or even humans, thus
illustrating the profound interconnectedness in seemingly unrelated
systems.</p>

Relationship of the Brain</h3>
<p>The supplementary figures (Figure .1, Figure .2, Figure .3, and
Figure .4) present the variations in degrees, clustering coefficients,
average path lengths, and small-worldness as a function of temperature
for both the classical Ising model and the generalized Ising model.</p>
<p>Figure .1 specifically illustrates the variation of the degree in
node 20 across ten different simulations for 9x9 (a) and 10x10 (b)
lattice sizes of the classical Ising model, as well as for the
generalized Ising model (c). The mean degrees are denoted by µ, with
error bars representing standard deviations. The figure shows that the
classical Ising model has a higher variance in the degree of node 20
compared to the generalized Ising model, indicating less stability or
predictability across different simulations.</p>
<p>Figures .2-4 detail the temperature dependence of graph theoretical
measures for both models: clustering coefficient (Figure .2), average
path length (Figure .3), and small-worldness (Figure .4).</p>
<p>In Figure .2a and b, the clustering coefficients of classical Ising
models with 9x9 and 10x10 lattice sizes, as well as the generalized
Ising model, are plotted. The curves show peaks near or at the critical
temperatures Tc for the classical models but do not peak for the
generalized Ising model, suggesting a less pronounced tendency towards
clustering at the critical point compared to classical models.</p>
<p>In Figure .3a and b, average path lengths of the classical Ising
models with 9x9 and 10x10 lattice sizes and the generalized Ising model
are plotted against temperature. The curves show minima near or at Tc
for both classical models, indicating shortest information paths at
criticality. For the generalized Ising model, although the minimum isn’t
exactly at T*, it’s close, suggesting a similar trend but not
necessarily pinpointing to the same temperature as observed in classical
Ising models.</p>
<p>Finally, Figure .4a and b present small-worldness for both models,
calculated using Equation 2.10. The curves indicate higher values
(closer to 1) for small-world property in generalized Ising model
compared to the classical Ising models, especially at temperatures
around T*. This suggests that the generalized Ising model might better
capture the balance between integration and segregation characteristic
of brain networks than the classical Ising model.</p>
<p>In summary, these supplementary figures provide insights into how
graph-theoretical properties evolve with temperature in both classical
and generalized Ising models, highlighting that while classical models
follow expected behaviors around their critical points, the generalized
Ising model, incorporating structural brain connectivity, presents
unique characteristics, particularly at T*. This supports our main
findings regarding the ability of the generalized Ising model to more
accurately represent aspects of the brain’s structure-function
relationship.</p>

<h3 id="using-yeast-to-implement-dna-based-algorithms">Using yeast to
implement DNA-based algorithms</h3>
<h3 id="thesis-summary-and-explanation">Thesis Summary and
Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Using Yeast to Implement DNA-Based
Algorithms</p>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Colton Arlington Smith</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2001, Master’s Thesis at the University of
Tennessee, Knoxville</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus:</strong> This thesis proposes and demonstrates a
novel biological computing system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (common
yeast) to implement DNA-based algorithms. It aims to provide an
alternative to the traditional DNA computer that is easier and less
costly to implement while retaining massive parallelism.</p>
<p><strong>1. Background:</strong> - Computer scientists seek
alternatives to semiconductor-based microelectronics for computation due
to limitations like slow speed and power consumption. - Leonard
Adleman’s 1993 invention of the DNA computer, which uses synthetic DNA
strands in test tube reactions to solve problems, highlighted the
potential of molecular computing.</p>
<p><strong>2. Motivation:</strong> - While Adleman’s DNA computers show
immense parallelism, they are costly and complex due to requirements for
DNA synthesizers and specialized enzymes. - This thesis proposes a
yeast-based computer that is more accessible and cheaper by using common
yeast strains instead of directly manipulating DNA.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Yeast Computer Encoding:</strong> - Genes in the yeast
genome are used to represent variables where wild-type alleles
correspond to ‘1’ (true) and mutant alleles to ‘0’ (false). - Two sets
of growth conditions select for either wild-type or mutant alleles. For
example, URA3 gene for uracil metabolism and LYS2 for lysine metabolism
are used in this study.</p>
<p><strong>4. Experiments and Results:</strong> - <strong>Solid-Phase
Computation:</strong> Initial attempts using agar plates involved
streaking yeast strains across different growth conditions (B, C, A, D).
While successful, the process was laborious and prone to human error in
interpreting growth vs carry-over. - <strong>Replica-Plating
Approach:</strong> Utilizing a device to transfer colonies from one agar
plate to another, replica plating attempted parallel processing. This
method improved efficiency but still faced challenges with carry-over
and scalability issues (number of plates required increases
exponentially with problem size). - <strong>Liquid-Phase
Computation:</strong> Given the limitations with solid media,
experiments were conducted in liquid cultures. A pooling strategy was
adopted where survivors from earlier stages were combined for subsequent
selections. This method showed promise but still required extensive
monitoring and interpretation of results.</p>
<p><strong>5. Analysis of Error Rates and Scalability:</strong> - The
computed errors were found to be minimal (no more than 10%), indicating
a relatively low error rate compared to DNA computing fidelity. - The
yeast computer’s potential for massive parallelism is highlighted by the
ability to process trillions of instructions theoretically, although
practical limitations due to slow operation times persist.</p>
<p><strong>6. Conclusions:</strong> - The study validates that a
biological computer can indeed be constructed using common yeast strains
and simple growth conditions. - While current implementations are slower
compared to digital computers, the approach offers cost-effectiveness,
simplicity in operation, and potential for significant parallel
processing capabilities. - Future work may focus on reducing errors
through optimized media formulations and improving computation
efficiency by refining liquid-phase techniques or exploring other
biological systems.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> - The thesis underscores the
potential of autonomous biological organisms in computational tasks,
highlighting advantages like accessibility and lower costs compared to
traditional DNA computing methods. - It serves as a foundational
exploration into using living cells for computation, paving the way for
further research into practical applications beyond boolean logic
problems, such as sensing environmental pollutants or monitoring
biological processes.</p>
<h3
id="whom-do-we-trust_-how-ai-is-reshaping-our-interactions-today">Whom
Do We Trust_ How AI Is (Re)Shaping Our Interactions Today</h3>
<p>Jillian Tett, Vice President for Applied Complexity at the Santa Fe
Institute, delivered a lecture on the intersection of artificial
intelligence (AI) and social relationships, focusing on trust. She
emphasized that AI is impacting how humans interact with each other,
particularly through three types of trust: eyeball-to-eyeball, vertical
(authority figures), and distributed (peer groups across vast
distances).</p>
<p>Tett highlighted two significant societal trends influencing these
shifts in trust: 1. The migration of trust from vertical institutions to
horizontal peer groups, especially due to the pervasive use of
smartphones enabling distributed trust. This shift is visible in various
aspects like medical advice-seeking, financial decision-making, and even
preferring AI bots as managers over human ones among Gen Z. 2. The rise
of Generation Pick &amp; Mix or C (Gen P), where individuals
increasingly customize their identities, preferences, and information
consumption, reflecting a shift from a derivative individual identity
within social groups to one that is more independent and
self-defined.</p>
<p>Tett outlined four ways humans interact with AI: as a master, mate,
mirror, or moderator. She pointed out that the prevailing Western
cultural narrative often envisions AI as a master figure, reflecting
fears of domination. However, she argued that AI is more likely entering
our lives through the horizontal axis of trust, acting as mates or
mirrors due to intimate, peer-group interactions facilitated by
smartphones.</p>
<p>The lecture underscored potential benefits and risks: - Positive
outcomes include increased access to healthcare, personalized education,
and therapeutic AI bots; - Risks involve manipulative AI tools and the
creation of echo chambers that exacerbate polarization and
fragmentation.</p>
<p>Tett stressed the importance of agency in managing interactions with
AI, suggesting that giving consumers choice over platforms and data sets
used for training could help retain human control. She advocated for
legislation prioritizing consumer choices, data transparency,
intellectual property protection for content creators, and legal
frameworks addressing AI culpability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Tett emphasized the need for “anthropology
intelligence” to guide the development of augmented intelligence,
ensuring human agency in shaping our future with AI tools. She
encouraged listeners to consider broader social and cultural contexts
when examining the implications of AI, urging a holistic approach that
prioritizes human values and well-being alongside technological
advancements.</p>

<p>Title: Computation by Natural Systems - An Overview of the Interface
Focus Theme Issue (2018)</p>
<p>The article “Computation by natural systems” is an introduction to a
special theme issue published in Interface Focus, Royal Society journal,
focusing on non-traditional computation found in various natural
systems. The authors, Dominique Chu, Mikhail Prokopenko, and J.
Christian J. Ray, discuss how computation extends beyond computer
science boundaries into biological systems, ecosystems, economies, and
brains. Despite the widespread acceptance that life computes, there is
still a lack of understanding regarding the fundamental principles
governing natural computation in living matter.</p>
<p>The theme issue comprises four major themes that emerged from a Royal
Society Theo Murphy workshop:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Non-traditional computing devices:
<ul>
<li>Nicolau and colleagues propose a strategy for reducing computational
time of NP-complete problems using network-based computation with
microfluidic structures.</li>
<li>Adamatzky suggests the use of fungi Basidiomycetes as computing
devices, representing information via electrical potential spikes within
their mycelium networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Neural networks and neuronal information processing:
<ul>
<li>Saglietti et al. present a novel learning rule that addresses
shortcomings of the Hopfield model for brain learning, offering insights
into both neuroscience and machine learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cellular and molecular biological information processing:
<ul>
<li>Suderman &amp; Deeds apply information theory to biochemical signal
transduction networks, highlighting limitations in biological
information transmission due to noise and suggesting that lower
information transmission may sometimes be advantageous.</li>
<li>Schmelling &amp; Axmann explore circadian rhythm mechanisms in
cells, emphasizing the role of feedback loops in computational models of
these oscillators and their robustness against environmental
changes.</li>
<li>Wiesner et al. use single-cell transcriptomic datasets to measure
binary entropy during cell differentiation, revealing a non-monotonic
variation that suggests previously unexplored dimensions of
expressivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The physics of information in complex systems:
<ul>
<li>Chu &amp; Spinney discuss a physically plausible model of finite
state machines (FSMs) and calculate the energy required for their
updates.</li>
<li>Kolchinsky &amp; Wolpert introduce semantic information, defined as
causally necessary correlation between a system and its environment,
analyzing it from a thermodynamic perspective using non-equilibrium
statistical physics methods.</li>
<li>Harding et al. study the thermodynamics of contagions (disease
spread) through contact networks, identifying critical thresholds and
phases of epidemics while introducing the concept of thermodynamic
efficiency in disease transmission interventions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The authors conclude by addressing the outlook for this field,
emphasizing the synergy between machine learning advances and
biotechnology, and highlighting the importance of considering
evolutionary forces shaping biological computation. They also mention
ongoing efforts to build a community around computations in natural
systems through a new book and a collaborative wiki.</p>
<p>In summary, this theme issue provides an interdisciplinary
examination of computation as observed in diverse natural
systems—spanning from microfluidic networks and fungal computing devices
to neural networks, cellular information processing, and complex system
physics—with the ultimate goal of synthesizing a comprehensive
understanding of natural computation.</p>
<h3 id="entangled-life">entangled life</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The text discusses fungi’s sensory abilities, comparing them to
plants’ and animals’, and how they integrate various data streams for
growth. It mentions the work of mycologist Stefan Olsson, who studied
bioluminescent Panellus fungi and observed spontaneous waves of
bioluminescence across networks.</p></li>
<li><p>Fungal hyphae are described as being highly sensitive to stimuli,
adapting to light, temperature, moisture, nutrients, toxins, and
electrical fields, akin to animal sensory systems but on a much smaller
scale. Hyphae can even detect the texture of surfaces and respond to
mechanical cues at a micrometer level.</p></li>
<li><p>The concept of “developmental indeterminism” is introduced—fungi
don’t have pre-programmed body plans like humans or most other animals;
instead, their growth patterns are fluid and adaptable based on
environmental stimuli. Mycelium can change its course rapidly in
response to new discoveries of resources (like food), withdrawing from
less promising avenues.</p></li>
<li><p>The idea that mycelial networks might communicate using
electrical signals is explored, referencing the work of mycologist
Stefan Olsson and subsequent studies by Andrew Adamatzky. These
researchers suggest that fungal networks could process information in a
manner analogous to brains or computers, with hyphal tips acting as
processing units. This concept, however, remains speculative due to the
lack of direct evidence showing causality between electrical impulses
and specific fungal responses.</p></li>
<li><p>The text concludes by raising questions about whether these
networked behaviors could be considered a form of cognition or
intelligence, distinct from animal-like intelligence, and whether we
have the tools to properly understand such unique forms of life. It
emphasizes the need for further research into fungal biology to unravel

strategies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The text discusses various aspects of symbiotic relationships between
fungi and other organisms, focusing on mycorrhizal associations and the
“wood wide web.” Here’s a detailed summary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mycorrhizal Associations: These are symbiotic relationships
between plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi. The fungi help plants absorb
water and nutrients, particularly phosphorus, from the soil, while
receiving carbohydrates from the plant in return. This relationship is
mutually beneficial and has been crucial for plant survival on land
since their migration from aquatic environments around 450 million years
ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Evolution of Mycorrhizal Relationships: The association between
plants and mycorrhizal fungi likely began with ancient algae moving onto
land, forming relationships with fungi in the soil. Over time, this led
to the evolution of more complex plant structures and the eventual
development of roots.</p></li>
<li><p>Mycorrhizal Fungi as Ecosystem Engineers: Mycorrhizal fungi play
a significant role in maintaining soil structure, water retention, and
nutrient cycling. They help plants compete better with weeds, resist
diseases, and tolerate stressful conditions like drought and
salinity.</p></li>
<li><p>Monotropa uniflora: These ghost-white, leafless plants are
mycoheterotrophs, relying entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for both carbon
and nutrients. They have lost the ability to photosynthesize, making
them a unique example of plant life adapted to their symbiotic
relationship with fungi.</p></li>
<li><p>The Wood Wide Web: This term, coined by Sir David Read in
response to Suzanne Simard’s work on shared mycorrhizal networks,
describes the interconnected network of plants through mycorrhizal
fungi. Research suggests that substances like carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus, and water can pass between plants via these networks in
meaningful quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Debate Around Significance: While many studies support the notion
that shared mycorrhizal networks enable unique ecological possibilities
and profoundly influence ecosystems, others argue that their importance
might be overstated. Some find little evidence of significant interplant
transfer in various ecosystems or with different fungal groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Mycoheterotrophs: Plants like Monotropa that depend entirely on
mycorrhizal fungi for survival exemplify the crucial role these
symbiotic relationships play in supporting diverse life forms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, mycorrhizal associations have been instrumental in the
evolution and success of plants on land. The “wood wide web” concept
highlights the interconnectedness of organisms through fungal networks,
emphasizing their importance in ecosystem functioning and plant survival
strategies.</p>
<p>This section discusses various aspects of human history and evolution
intertwined with fungi, particularly yeasts and mushrooms. The narrative
explores how humans have interacted with these organisms throughout
time, shaping our culture, diet, and even biology.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Ancient Brewing and Agriculture</strong>: Humans have
been brewing alcoholic beverages for thousands of years, possibly since
the Neolithic transition around 12,000 years ago. Yeasts, specifically
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, facilitated this process and played a
significant role in the shift from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled
agricultural communities. This relationship between humans and yeast
illustrates how fungi have influenced human cultural and societal
developments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yeast as Model Organisms</strong>: Due to their
simplicity and resemblance to eukaryotic cells, yeasts like
Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been instrumental in genetic and cell
biology research. Their genome sequencing in 1996 marked a significant
milestone in the study of eukaryotic life forms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mushrooms: Cultural and Historical Perspectives</strong>:
Mushrooms have long fascinated humans, evoking both awe and fear due to
their potent effects. Various cultures have depicted them as sacred or
demonic, influencing artistic, religious, and even culinary expressions.
The binary classification of cultures as “mycophilic” (fungus-loving) or
“mycophobic” (fungus-fearing) by Gordon Wasson highlights this dichotomy
in human perceptions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Metaphors and Classification</strong>: The challenge of
categorizing fungi reflects broader issues with understanding non-human
life forms through human lenses. Anthropomorphic interpretations have
historically dominated, but contemporary mycologists strive for more
nuanced perspectives acknowledging the complexities and diversity within
fungal kingdoms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbiotic Relationships</strong>: The concept of
symbiosis—close cooperation between different species for mutual
benefit—challenges traditional evolutionary narratives focused on
competition and conflict (“red in tooth and claw”). This shift in
perspective gained traction during the Cold War, with scientists seeking
ways to understand coexistence amidst global tensions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Drunken Monkey Hypothesis</strong>: Proposed by Robert
Dudley, this hypothesis posits that humans’ fascination with alcohol
stems from our primate ancestors’ adaptation to consuming fermented
fruits. The evolution of the ADH4 enzyme in primates forty times more
efficient than its predecessor suggests a co-evolutionary relationship
between our species and yeast-produced alcohol.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intoxication as Rediscovery</strong>: Embracing
intoxication through fermented substances like cider can serve as a
means to experience altered states of consciousness, bridging the gap
between human and fungal experiences. This approach challenges rigid
categories and invites exploration of alternative ways of knowing and
perceiving the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Narrative Influence</strong>: Stories significantly shape
our understanding and interactions with the natural world, including
fungi. By examining how narratives have framed human-fungal
relationships, we can appreciate both their historical influence and
potential for evolving perspectives that acknowledge the
interconnectedness of life forms.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This detailed summary encapsulates various dimensions of human
history and biology intricately linked with fungi, emphasizing the
reciprocal evolutionary journey between humans and these remarkable
organisms. It underscores the importance of viewing fungi not merely as
separate entities but as integral components shaping our cultural
narratives, scientific pursuits, and biological makeup.</p>
<p>The text provided is a detailed exploration of various aspects
related to fungi, their interactions with other organisms, and their
historical, cultural, and scientific significance. Here’s a summary and
explanation of the main points:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fungal Diversity and Importance</strong>: Fungi are
diverse organisms that play crucial roles in ecosystems as decomposers,
symbionts (like mycorrhizae), and even potential pathogens. They have
been present on Earth for a long time, with evidence suggesting their
existence for billions of years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Historical and Cultural Significance</strong>: Fungi have
played various roles in human history and culture. Ancient civilizations
used them for food, medicine, and religious ceremonies (e.g., the
Eleusinian Mysteries involving ergot-containing grains). However,
attitudes towards fungi vary widely across cultures—some view them as
beneficial or neutral, while others see them as harmful or even
evil.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fungal Symbiosis and Plant Interactions</strong>: Many
plants have mutualistic relationships with fungi through mycorrhizae,
which aid in nutrient uptake for the plant and receive carbohydrates
from the plant in return. These associations can significantly impact
plant distribution and survival, especially under stressful
conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Perspectives</strong>: The coevolution of
fungi and plants has shaped terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal endophytes
reside within plant tissues and can influence host physiology,
potentially providing benefits like disease resistance or stress
tolerance. Horizontal gene transfer between fungi and other organisms
(including plants) has also played a role in evolutionary
history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fungal Pathogens</strong>: Some fungi cause diseases in
animals and humans. For example, Candida species can lead to systemic
infections in immunocompromised individuals. Other fungi impact
agricultural productivity by causing plant diseases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fungal Neurobiology</strong>: Certain fungi produce
psychedelic compounds (like psilocybin) that can affect human
consciousness, leading to their use in religious and therapeutic
contexts. Research into the neurological effects of these substances is
ongoing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fungal Biology and Ecology</strong>: Fungi exhibit
complex behaviors, such as chemotaxis and decision-making processes when
foraging or responding to resources. They can also communicate through
volatile organic compounds, influencing plant and insect
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scientific Research and Applications</strong>: Modern
research into fungal genomics, biochemistry, and ecology is expanding
our understanding of their roles in nutrient cycling, climate
regulation, and disease dynamics. There’s also growing interest in
utilizing fungi for biofuel production, bioremediation, and development
of novel pharmaceuticals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural Misconceptions</strong>: Historically, fungi
have often been misunderstood or overlooked due to their microscopic
nature and diverse forms. This has led to anthropocentric views that
position humans at the center of biological classification and
importance, neglecting the integral roles of non-animal life forms like
fungi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Philosophical and Ethical Considerations</strong>:
There’s a call for reconsidering human exceptionalism in light of fungal
capabilities—such as their complex networks, communication methods, and
adaptive strategies—which challenge traditional boundaries between
living organisms and non-living entities. This perspective encourages
more holistic views that integrate fungi into broader ecological and
evolutionary narratives.</p></li>

<h3 id="excitationinhibition_ising">excitationinhibition_ising</h3>
<p>The paper presents an improved method for inferring Ising models of
neuronal networks’ spiking activity using pairwise maximum entropy
principles. This approach aims to address the limitations of existing
works, which often lack reliable error estimates on model parameters.
The new method incorporates random walks in parameter space
post-convergence of the optimization algorithm, employing adaptive
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for uncertainty estimation in a
computationally efficient manner.</p>
<p>The study applies this method to data from human temporal cortex
recordings of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons during various
sleep states – wakefulness, light sleep, and deep sleep. The analysis
demonstrates that the Ising model captures collective behavior
significantly better than an independent model when considering both
excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neuron types. Ignoring inhibitory
effects of I neurons leads to overestimation of synchrony among E
neurons, indicating the importance of modeling inhibition for accurate
representation.</p>
<p>Information-theoretic measures suggest that the Ising model explains
80-95% of correlations observed, depending on sleep state and neuron
type. Thermodynamic measures hint at criticality signatures, although
this interpretation requires caution as it may merely reflect long-range
neural correlations rather than genuine critical behavior.</p>
<p>Key improvements include the method’s reliability in estimating
parameter uncertainties, its applicability to large neuronal networks (N
≈100), and the rigorous quantification of uncertainties previously
absent in most literature on neural Ising models. The study emphasizes
the need for such advancements as multielectrode arrays generate
increasingly larger datasets from which effective theories describing
large neuronal networks’ dynamics must be formulated.</p>
<p>The method combines maximum entropy modeling with MCMC, allowing
robust inference of model parameters while accounting for uncertainties
through adaptive algorithms. The results highlight the crucial role of
inhibitory neurons and long-range correlations in neural network
behavior across different sleep states, paving the way for more accurate
models of complex biological neural systems.</p>
<p>In summary, this research not only improves upon existing Ising
modeling techniques for neuronal networks but also provides a
comprehensive framework to analyze large-scale neuronal data, offering
insights into the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons
and their dynamics during various states of consciousness.</p>

<li><strong>Fitness Indicators</strong>: Biological traits that have
evolved to reveal an organism’s fitness, especially its genetic quality,
which is determined by the absence of harmful mutations. Fitness
indicators are crucial for mate choice as they allow potential mates to
assess each other’s genetic quality without needing to observe their
entire genetic makeup directly.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary Fitness vs Physical Fitness</strong>:
Evolutionary fitness refers to an organism’s reproductive success in a
particular environment, considering competition with conspecifics
(members of the same species) and adaptation to that specific
environment. In contrast, physical fitness is related to health,
strength, energy, and resistance to diseases within a species-typical
context. Physical fitness is often more directly measurable and
transferable across situations than evolutionary fitness.</li>
<li><strong>Condition</strong>: Refers to the overall health and
well-being of an organism, influencing its fitness. While condition can
fluctuate due to external factors like disease or injury, it generally
correlates with fitness. A high-fitness organism in poor condition might
not perform as expected, whereas a low-fitness individual in good
condition could fare relatively better.</li>
<li><strong>Lek Paradox</strong>: An apparent contradiction where leks
(congregations of males displaying for female mate choice) seem to
eliminate genetic variation through rapid spread of the fittest male
traits, yet these leks persist across generations. This paradox arises
because lekking should theoretically result in all individuals having
equal fitness if selection maximizes it, thereby erasing the need for
choosy females.</li>
<li><strong>Heritability of Fitness</strong>: The persistence of genetic
variation within species despite selection aiming to maximize fitness.
This variation is maintained due to environmental fluctuations across
time and space as well as the constant arrival of new mutations that
lower fitness, which natural selection must eliminate at the same rate
to prevent mutational meltdown and extinction.</li>
<li><strong>Mutations and Brain Evolution</strong>: The human brain’s
complexity makes it vulnerable to mutations, serving as a large target
for genetic variation. Consequently, mental traits may be better fitness
indicators because they provide more comprehensive information about an
individual’s mutation load. The brain’s significant mutational target
size could make it a prime candidate for evolution through sexual
selection based on fitness indicators.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability of Fitness Indicators</strong>: Despite
potential incentives for deception, organisms evolve mechanisms to
ensure the reliability of fitness indicators. These indicators provide
valuable information about genetic quality and condition, allowing
choosy individuals to make informed mate selection decisions that
enhance reproductive success.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the text discusses how fitness indicators work within
sexual selection, with a focus on evolutionary fitness versus physical
fitness, conditions affecting fitness, paradoxes like the lek
phenomenon, and the heritability of fitness amidst mutations.
Furthermore, it suggests that complex traits such as the human brain
serve effectively as fitness indicators due to their high mutational
target size, despite challenges in reliably advertising one’s genetic
quality.</p>
<p>In the Pleistocene era, human ancestors lived in small, mobile
groups, with females and their children distributing themselves
according to food sources, while males distributed themselves based on
where the females were. The ancestral environment was primarily
sub-Saharan African, featuring open savanna, scrub, and forest areas.
Human ancestors spent most of their time foraging for food and
socializing, with intermittent danger from predators, parasites, germs,
and occasional starvation. Leisure time was more abundant compared to
modern life.</p>
<p>Regarding sexual relationships and choice, our hominid ancestors did
not engage in practices like going on dates or giving gifts, as these
concepts emerged much later in human history. However, they likely had
complex systems of selecting mates based on various factors. To
understand this better, let’s examine sexual selection patterns in other
primates, which share some similarities with our ancestors’
behavior:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Monogamous couples (e.g., gibbons and certain lemurs): In such
cases, a single male mates with a single female, as food sources don’t
concentrate enough for group foraging. Males primarily defend their
territories and females from other males.</li>
<li>Harem systems (e.g., hamadryas baboons, colobus monkeys): Here, a
dominant male secures access to multiple females within his group. This
system drives strong sexual selection pressures for male traits like
size, strength, aggressiveness, and large canine teeth.</li>
<li>Multi-male, multi-female groups (e.g., baboons, macaques): In these
settings, female choice becomes more prominent as they can select
between multiple males. Females may favor dominant males, male “friends”
who have groomed them extensively or been kind to their offspring, or
new males from outside the group to avoid inbreeding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Female primates generally display less overt courtship behaviors
compared to males. Their preferences remain somewhat obscure but are
thought to involve traits like dominance, social status, or even
kindness and grooming behavior towards offspring. Some reports suggest
females might choose males based on personality or intelligence,
although more research is needed in this area.</p>
<p>In multi-male groups, female choice can influence male courtship
efforts. This could involve displaying dominance, forming alliances,
providing material resources (though not as prominent a factor), and
offering paternal care—though its extent is still debated among
researchers. Male primates have evolved diverse traits like elaborate
facial hair or colorful displays to attract females, but female
preferences for such features are not well-studied.</p>
<p>In summary, hominid ancestors likely engaged in complex sexual
relationships and mate choices based on a combination of factors
including dominance, social status, and perhaps personality or
intelligence. Female choice played a significant role in shaping male
traits and behaviors through sexual selection pressures, which might
have laid the groundwork for some aspects of human courtship and mating
preferences that persist to this day.</p>
<p>The human body, particularly in terms of sexual characteristics, has
evolved distinctively due to sexual selection pressures from both males
and females, as opposed to solely through natural selection for
survival. Various body parts such as penises, breasts, buttocks, beards,
head hair, and full lips have been shaped by these sexual selection
processes, exhibiting sex differences, appearing or enlarging after
puberty, and becoming more engorged during sexual arousal. These traits
are still universally considered attractive across human cultures,
indicating their evolution through prehistoric sexual choice.</p>
<p>The penis is an especially fascinating example of a sexually selected
trait in humans. Unlike other primates or mammals, human males possess
significantly larger, thicker, and more flexible penises. These traits
are not merely for sperm delivery but have also been shaped by female
choice through tactile stimulation during copulation. The intensity and
duration of copulatory courtship, as well as the use of various
positions facilitated by the human penis’s flexibility, highlight the
role of female choice in its evolution.</p>
<p>Female orgasm, mediated by the clitoris, presents another example of
sexual selection. Although some scientists have viewed it as an
incidental side-effect of male orgasm or a mechanism for promoting
monogamy, evidence suggests that female orgasm is an adaptation for
female choice rather than pair bonding. It ensures that women choose
mates who can deliver pleasurable experiences during copulation.</p>
<p>Breast evolution in humans illustrates how sexual selection has
shaped both body ornaments and function. While mammary glands evolved
primarily for milk production, human female breasts have enlarged to
signal youth, developmental stability, and fat reserves—all factors
appealing to males during courtship. The variation in breast sizes
across women indicates that there’s no single optimal size for
breast-feeding; rather, it reflects the role of male choice and genetic
variation in breast evolution.</p>
<p>In summary, sexual selection has played a significant role in shaping
human body traits, including those traditionally associated with
physical reproduction, as well as mental capacities. By examining body
parts such as penises, clitorises, buttocks, and breasts, we can infer
the mechanisms of sexual choice exerted by both males and females
throughout human evolutionary history. This interplay between sexes in
shaping bodily features offers a more nuanced understanding of our
species’ distinctive traits and their underlying evolutionary
origins.</p>
<p>The text discusses the evolutionary perspective on human morality,
arguing that it is primarily driven by sexual selection rather than
survival benefits. The author suggests that moral virtues like kindness,
generosity, helpfulness, fairness, and leadership have evolved because
they signal fitness to potential mates. This is supported by David
Buss’s findings indicating that kindness is the most desired trait in a
sexual partner across cultures.</p>
<p>The text further explores different theories of morality’s evolution:
kin selection and reciprocal altruism. Kin selection explains generosity
towards relatives as a way for genes to propagate themselves, while
reciprocal altruism proposes that cooperation between non-relatives can
be sustained through repeated interactions with punishment for cheaters.
However, these theories have limitations and cannot fully explain
various human moral behaviors.</p>
<p>The author then introduces an alternative view—that morality evolved
as a form of costly signaling, a Zahavian handicap, to indicate good
genes to potential mates. This approach explains why individuals exhibit
moral virtues even at personal costs, as these costs can be overcome by
the benefits reaped through enhanced sexual attractiveness and
subsequent reproductive success.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, the text refers to handaxes created by
early hominids. These tools required considerable skill and effort,
suggesting that their creation served as a fitness indicator for the
makers. The author proposes that males with artistic abilities might
have gained mating advantages due to their capacity to produce visually
appealing objects—thus turning creativity into a sexual ornament.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the text argues that human morality evolved as part of
sexual selection, with moral behaviors acting as costly signals of
fitness to potential mates. While kinship and reciprocal altruism play
essential roles in understanding certain aspects of human morality, a
broader perspective incorporating Zahavian handicapping provides a more
comprehensive explanation for the diversity and prevalence of human
moral virtues.</p>
<p>The chapter “Cyrano and Scheherazade” discusses the evolutionary
perspective on human language, focusing on its potential sexual
functions rather than survival benefits. The author argues that language
did not evolve solely for communication or reciprocity, as previously
believed, but was instead a means for courtship and status displays.
This view is contrasted with traditional theories that emphasize
altruism, kin selection, and reciprocity in understanding human
morality.</p>
<p>The author proposes three basic options for the hidden benefit of
language: kinship, reciprocity, or sexual selection. However, they focus
on sexual selection as a primary driving force behind language
evolution. The idea suggests that language evolved to facilitate verbal
courtship between our Pleistocene ancestors, allowing them to showcase
their personalities and ideas during conversations with potential
mates.</p>
<p>This theory addresses the altruism problem associated with
communication, as sexual selection inherently involves competition and
can favor costly displays even when they seem counterintuitive from a
survival standpoint. The author further argues that human language
evolved through male orators competing for social status by speaking
eloquently, with higher-status individuals having more reproductive
advantages. This idea builds on anthropologist Robbins Burling’s work
and extends it to include courtship as a significant factor in language
evolution.</p>
<p>Other contributors like linguist John Locke and researcher Jean-Louis
Dessalles have also highlighted the role of verbal plumage and relevance
displays in human sexual competition. These social status aspects of
language evolution align with the notion that sexual selection shaped
human language in both direct (through mate choice) and indirect
(through social status) ways.</p>
<p>The chapter delves into various facets of this verbal courtship
theory: 1. Human language’s apparent altruism contrasts with its
evolutionary benefits, as seen in the excessive time and energy invested
in speaking, which appears to provide more benefits to listeners than
speakers. However, human behavior shows that we actively compete for the
opportunity to talk rather than merely listen. 2. Our anatomy,
particularly our speaking apparatus being far more developed than our
listening one, supports this verbal courtship theory as opposed to
information-sharing oriented views of language evolution. 3. Verbal
courtship extends beyond direct flirtation, encompassing public speech
and debate where individuals strive to showcase their knowledge,
intelligence, wit, experience, morality, imagination, and
self-confidence. This form of communication significantly impacts social
status and sexual attractiveness. 4. The content of language (ideas and
feelings) is deemed more important than its mere formal structure or
acoustics for conveying information during courtship. Sexual selection
may have shaped language’s content rather than form, making it an
indirect indicator of fitness rather than an ornament in itself like
bird songs. 5. Life stories, shared through verbal communication,
provide critical information about one’s past experiences and
plans—something mute animals cannot easily accomplish. The ability to
articulate these experiences efficiently during courtship helps
individuals demonstrate their resilience, adaptability, and coping
abilities. 6. Human language allows for introspection, expanding
conscious experience and enabling articulation of complex thoughts and
feelings, which may have been favored by sexual selection due to the
attractiveness of such displays in potential mates. 7. Gossip, as a mix
of social grooming and courtship displays, can be seen as a way for
individuals to indicate their social skills, status, and access to
exclusive information—thus serving as both a social bonding mechanism
and a tool for self-promotion and courtship.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the chapter presents language evolution through a
sexual selection lens, with verbal courtship being central to its
development. This approach emphasizes the role of language in signaling
fitness indicators, establishing social status, and engaging in complex
mate choice processes, ultimately illustrating that human language may
have evolved as an elaborate form of courtship display rather than
merely a tool for communication or reciprocity.</p>
<p>The text presents a discussion on the evolution of human creativity,
suggesting that it may have evolved through sexual selection as an
indicator of proteanism ability, youthfulness, energy, intelligence, and
fitness. Proteanism refers to adaptive unpredictability in behavior,
which can be beneficial in various situations like avoiding predators or
manipulating social interactions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Protean Brain Mechanisms</strong>: Creativity might have
evolved from brain mechanisms originally designed for proteanism, such
as rapidly generating and recombining ideas. These brain systems could
have been modified to serve the purpose of creative thought, allowing
individuals to produce novel ideas by activating and recombining
existing concepts in unpredictable ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indicator Theory</strong>: Creativity may also be viewed
as an indicator of proteanism ability, something that sexual selection
would favor since better proteanism abilities could lead to social
benefits like improved mate choices or alliances. Individuals who can
effectively and creatively adapt their behaviors based on context would
have been desirable partners due to their perceived higher social
intelligence and strategic prowess.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Playfulness as a Youth Indicator</strong>: Another
proposed link between proteanism and creativity is through playfulness,
which may have evolved as an indicator of youthfulness and fertility.
Adult human playfulness, although uncommon in other mammals, could be a
reliable signal to potential partners about the individual’s health,
energy, and overall fitness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neophilia</strong>: The attraction to novelty, or
neophilia, is suggested as a crucial factor driving human creativity’s
evolution. Since our ancestors might have been highly neophilic, novel
forms of courtship displays (like creative humor and storytelling) could
have become attractive ways to keep partners interested over time,
preventing boredom-induced relationship breakdowns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Trade-offs</strong>: While problem-solving
abilities are vital for survival, the evolution of creativity as a form
of courtship display implies that natural selection may have prioritized
entertainment and novelty over purely practical or efficient solutions
during human mating processes. This perspective suggests that while
certain cognitive capacities might contribute to both survival and
reproductive success, their primary function could have been in the
service of sexual attraction rather than solely for
problem-solving.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the text proposes a multifaceted evolutionary explanation
for human creativity, viewing it as an adaptation shaped by both natural
and sexual selection pressures. Creativity may represent adaptive
unpredictability (proteanism) beneficial in various contexts, including
courtship, where novelty and entertainment could have been crucial for
attracting mates and maintaining long-term relationships. The evolution
of creative abilities might stem from brain mechanisms repurposed from
earlier functions related to adaptive unpredictability, with playfulness
serving as a youth indicator and neophilia driving the preference for
novelty in courtship displays.</p>
<p>The text provided is a glossary of terms related to evolutionary
psychology, sexual selection, and human behavior. Here’s a summary and
explanation of some key concepts from the glossary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Conspicuous Consumption</strong>: This refers to costly
indicators of wealth displayed to achieve social status, often compared
to sexually selected handicaps in other animal species. In humans, this
might involve displaying expensive goods or engaging in lavish spending
to signal high socioeconomic status.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Aesthetics</strong>: The application of
evolutionary theory to understand human preferences for beauty and
aesthetic qualities. This concept suggests that our appreciation for
certain forms, colors, or patterns might have evolved as adaptations
favoring survival and reproductive success in our ancestors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Courtship Effort</strong>: The time, energy, skill, and
resources expended by individuals trying to impress potential sexual
partners. This effort can vary among individuals depending on factors
like mate value and competition within a population.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Developmental Stability</strong>: An organism’s ability
to produce symmetrical body parts despite environmental and genetic
stresses. Symmetry in bodily features is often considered an indicator
of developmental stability, suggesting good health and genetic
quality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dimorphism</strong>: Refers to the physical differences
between males and females in a species. In humans, this includes
differences in body size, muscle mass, and secondary sexual
characteristics such as facial hair or breasts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discriminative Parental Solicitude</strong>: Parents
investing more care and attention in offspring they perceive to have
better chances of survival and reproduction. This can lead to
differential treatment of children based on factors like health, sex, or
birth order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Display</strong>: Any conspicuous behavior shaped by
evolution to advertise an individual’s fitness, condition, motivation,
or desperation to potential mates, rivals, or predators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dominance</strong>: The ability to intimidate others and
secure resources, territory, or sexual partners without engaging in
physical combat. Dominant individuals often establish a hierarchy within
a group, which can influence access to mates and reproductive
success.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ecological Niche</strong>: A species’ position within an
ecosystem, describing its habitat, food supply, predators, parasites,
and interactions with other organisms. Understanding ecological niches
is crucial for studying species coexistence, competition, and
evolutionary adaptations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equilibrium</strong>: In game theory, an unchangeable
state where no player can improve their outcome by altering their
strategy, given the strategies of other players remain constant.
Equilibrium selection refers to processes that determine which
equilibrium is adopted in games with multiple potential
outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Psychology</strong>: The study of
psychological adaptations and their evolutionary origins, adaptive
functions, brain mechanisms, genetic inheritance, and social effects in
humans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended Phenotype</strong>: An organism’s genetically
influenced impacts on its environment that extend beyond its body, such
as beaver dams or bowerbird constructions, which aid in survival and
reproduction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fitness Indicator</strong>: Traits that evolved to
showcase an individual’s fitness during courtship, typically through
costly ornaments or behaviors deemed too expensive for lower-fitness
individuals to maintain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fitness Matching</strong>: Mate choice based on
assortative mating for similar levels of fitness in a competitive mating
market, where individuals choose partners with the highest fitness
willing to mate with them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These concepts and terms illustrate how evolutionary principles can
help explain various human behaviors, preferences, and social dynamics.
They emphasize that many aspects of human nature have evolved through
natural and sexual selection pressures shaping our ancestors’
reproductive successes.</p>

<p>The text discusses the importance of being in good physical shape for
attracting women, emphasizing that it is not superficial but rather a
measure of genetic fitness. Women are instinctively drawn to men who
appear healthy because good physical health indicates overall genetic
quality and longevity. The three main factors contributing to physical
health are sleep, nutrition, and exercise.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sleep: Aim for 8-9 hours of uninterrupted, dark sleep in a
pitch-black room to optimize hormone production and overall health.
Minimize screen exposure, especially electronic screens, for at least
two hours before bedtime to avoid disrupting melatonin release and
circadian rhythm.</li>
<li>Nutrition: Focus on unprocessed, natural foods such as lean
proteins, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats while avoiding added
sugars, grains, processed foods, high-sugar fruits, and “fat-free” or
low-fat items. This approach promotes weight loss, improved health, and
increased attractiveness to women.</li>
<li>Exercise: Engage in strength training with heavy loads and high
intensity for short durations, prioritizing compound movements like
squats, push-ups, and pull-ups. Avoid excessive cardio and focus on
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) instead. Two beginner workout
options are suggested: at-home air squats and push-ups or joining a
CrossFit gym for a more structured and social approach to fitness.</li>
</ol>
<p>By prioritizing these three elements of physical health, men can
significantly improve their attractiveness to women and overall quality
of life.</p>
<p>In summary, social proof is a crucial aspect of attractiveness for
women, as it provides them with information about a man’s traits,
strengths, virtues, and social skills. Social proof can be broken down
into several components: popularity (being well-liked), status
(attracting attention), influence (changing minds), prestige (respect
from others), extroversion (outgoing personality), and fame (wide
recognition). To improve one’s social proof, it is essential to focus on
building a strong social network, developing good friendships, engaging
in activities that help improve social skills, taking on jobs that
require interaction with diverse people, volunteering, and leveraging
existing connections.</p>
<p>To display social proof, men can be outgoing, have friends, spend
time with women, involve their friends in their dating life, host
parties or organize events, go on group dates, participate in team
sports or join clubs, and adopt pets (while ensuring they are genuinely
caring for the animal). By focusing on these aspects, men can enhance
their attractiveness to women by showcasing their social fitness and
value. It is essential to remember that social proof should not be
pursued as an end in itself but rather as a means to demonstrate the
underlying traits that make a man desirable.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Language is crucial for initiating sexual relationships, forming
long-term partnerships, and resolving conflicts in relationships.
However, society does not typically teach conversational skills, leaving
men to figure it out on their own.</p></li>
<li><p>Women and men have different conversational styles and goals at
various stages of life. Guys often approach conversations directly,
while women prefer more subtle, indirect communication. Understanding
these differences is essential for successful interactions with
women.</p></li>
<li><p>To improve conversation skills, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Be Genuine: Authenticity is key in conversations. Women
appreciate men who are honest and transparent. Avoid pretending to be
someone you’re not.</p></li>
<li><p>Active Listening: Show genuine interest in what she says by
maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking relevant questions. This
demonstrates respect and makes her feel valued.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonverbal Communication: Pay attention to your body language,
facial expressions, and tone of voice. These nonverbal cues can convey
more about your true feelings than words alone. Maintain open and
inviting posture, smile genuinely, and speak softly yet
clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Mirroring: Subtly imitate her body language, tone, or speech
patterns to establish rapport and show that you’re in sync with her.
This creates a sense of connection and comfort.</p></li>
<li><p>Be Patient: Don’t rush conversations or try to force topics she’s
not interested in discussing. Let the conversation flow naturally based
on mutual interests and shared experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Share Stories: Women love storytellers. Share anecdotes about
your life, rather than stating facts directly. This helps her visualize
you as part of a narrative she can relate to and remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice Empathy: Understand that women often have more complex
emotional lives than men. Show empathy by acknowledging their feelings
and offering support. Avoid dismissing or minimizing her emotions, even
if they seem irrational to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn from Mistakes: Don’t be afraid of making mistakes during
conversations. Instead, learn from them and improve your approach with
each interaction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>By mastering these conversation skills, men can effectively engage
women, create lasting impressions, and build stronger relationships.
Remember that practice is key to becoming a charismatic
conversationalist. The more you converse, the better you’ll become at
reading cues, adjusting your approach, and creating meaningful
connections with women.</p>

<p>The text presents a section on Randomized Algorithms and
Probabilistic Analysis within the context of computer science, focusing
on Michael Mitzenmacher and Eli Upfal’s book “Probability and
Computing.” It highlights that randomization plays an essential role in
modern computer science with applications in areas like combinatorial
optimization, machine learning, communication networks, and secure
protocols.</p>
<p>The text outlines the book’s structure, covering core material such
as random sampling, expectations, Markov’s inequality, Chebyshev’s
inequality, Chernoff bounds, balls-and-bins models, probabilistic
method, and Markov chains in its first half. The second half delves into
more advanced topics like continuous probability, applications of
limited independence, entropy, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,
coupling, martingales, and balanced allocations.</p>
<p>The authors introduce the concept of randomized algorithms, which
make random choices during execution to break symmetry, prevent repeated
accesses, or improve efficiency. These algorithms, while potentially
incorrect with some probability, often offer significant speed or memory
benefits compared to deterministic solutions in many real-world
applications.</p>
<p>Probabilistic analysis of algorithms aims to understand how
algorithms perform when inputs are chosen from a well-defined
probabilistic space, providing an explanation for why problems deemed
hard by classical worst-case complexity theory can be easy on most
inputs that occur in practical scenarios.</p>
<p>The chapter emphasizes the book’s pedagogical purpose as an
introductory text covering fundamental techniques and paradigms used in
developing probabilistic algorithms and analyses, designed for advanced
undergraduates or beginning graduate students in computer science and
applied mathematics. The book assumes only basic knowledge of discrete
mathematics and provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment with
numerous examples and exercises.</p>
<p>The chapter also discusses the importance of randomness in various
scientific fields such as physics, genetics, biology, economics, and
more, underscoring its critical role not just in theoretical computer
science but across multiple disciplines. The authors’ book seeks to
cover this essential aspect systematically for students entering the
field.</p>
<p>The text discusses several applications of random processes and
probabilistic methods to solve problems in computer science and
algorithms. Here’s a detailed summary and explanation of the key
concepts and examples presented:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Birthday Paradox</strong>: This well-known probability
problem illustrates how seemingly counterintuitive results can arise
from standard probability models. The surprising outcome that, in a room
with 30 people, there’s a higher chance than not of sharing a birthday
highlights the importance of analyzing such scenarios with accurate
probabilistic tools rather than relying on intuition alone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Balls-and-Bins Model</strong>: This model is used to
analyze the distribution of m balls thrown into n bins independently and
uniformly at random. It provides insights into various properties, such
as the number of empty bins, the maximum load (maximum number of balls
in a bin), and their expected values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maximum Load Bound</strong>: The text presents an upper
bound on the maximum load in the balls-and-bins model using the union
bound and analyzing the probability that any single bin receives too
many balls. Although this bound is not tight, it serves to demonstrate
basic probabilistic reasoning techniques.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bucket Sort Algorithm</strong>: This sorting algorithm
exploits the uniform distribution assumption on input data. By dividing
the range of elements into buckets based on their binary
representation’s leading digits, Bucket sort achieves linear expected
time complexity (O(n)) for sorting n elements. It uses a two-stage
process: first distributing (bucketing) and then sorting each bucket
using a simple quadratic algorithm like Bubblesort or Insertion
sort.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Poisson Distribution</strong>: The text introduces the
Poisson distribution as a limiting case of binomial distributions when
both the number of trials (n) goes to infinity and the success
probability for each trial approaches zero, such that their product
remains constant (λ = nm). This leads to approximations like
e<sup>(-λ)/λ</sup>k for the probability mass function Pr(X=k), where X
follows a Poisson distribution with parameter λ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Number of Empty Bins</strong>: By applying
results from the binomial distribution, one can determine that in the
balls-and-bins model, when m = n, the expected fraction of empty bins is
approximately e^(-m/n). This approximation offers a simple way to
estimate key properties of such random processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generalization for r Balls per Bin</strong>: The
discussion extends beyond simply calculating the probability of a bin
having zero balls by considering the scenario where a bin has exactly r
balls (with r being a constant). Using Stirling’s approximation and
ignoring lower-order terms, one can approximate the probability using
exponential functions that incorporate both n and m.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These examples illustrate the utility of probabilistic methods and
techniques in analyzing randomized algorithms and processes, providing
theoretical foundations for understanding their behavior and performance
guarantees. By applying these concepts, one can develop efficient and
well-founded solutions to real-world problems in computer science and
related fields.</p>
<p>The text discusses various applications and techniques related to the
probabilistic method, a way of proving the existence of objects by
demonstrating a sample space from which an object with the required
properties is selected with positive probability. The chapter covers
several key topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Basic Counting Argument</strong>: Demonstrates that for a
complete graph K_n with n vertices and m edges, there exists a
2-coloring of its edges such that no monochromatic k-clique exists when
(n choose k)^(-1) + 1 &lt; 1, using the probabilistic method.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expectation Argument</strong>: Introduces Lemma 6.2,
which states that if a random variable X with expectation E[X] = μ has
positive probability of being at least or less than μ, then there exists
an object in the sample space with the desired properties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample and Modify</strong>: Illustrates how to turn
probabilistic constructions into algorithms. This is demonstrated using
a derandomized algorithm for finding large cuts in graphs based on a
randomized algorithm that chooses vertices randomly and places them in
two sets A and B.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second Moment Method</strong>: Presents an alternative
technique to the second moment method for proving properties of sums of
Bernoulli random variables, using Theorem 6.7 and showing how it can be
used to prove threshold behavior in random graphs (Theorem
6.8).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditional Expectation Inequality</strong>: Introduces
Theorem 6.10, a powerful tool for bounding the probability that a sum of
Bernoulli random variables exceeds a certain threshold, by relating it
to conditional expectations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lovasz Local Lemma (Symmetric Version)</strong>: A
crucial result in combinatorics and algorithm design, allowing proofs of
existence under dependency constraints. This is demonstrated with
Theorem 6.11 for showing that a k-SAT formula has a satisfying
assignment if no variable appears in more than T = 2k^4 clauses (Theorem
6.13).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit Constructions Using the Local Lemma</strong>:
Shows how to use the Lovasz local lemma to derive efficient construction
algorithms, illustrated with an algorithm for k-SAT formulas (Theorem
6.16).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General Case of the Lovasz Local Lemma</strong>: Presents
and proves Theorem 6.17, which extends the local lemma to arbitrary
probability spaces and dependency graphs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout these discussions, exercises are provided that challenge
readers to apply these methods to various problems in graph theory,
combinatorics, and algorithm design, such as finding large cuts,
derandomizing k-SAT algorithms, and proving properties of tournaments
and hypergraphs. The exercises encourage deeper understanding and
practical application of the probabilistic method principles.</p>
<p>The text provides a detailed explanation of the Poisson process, its
definition, properties, and application to counting random events. The
Poisson process is a stochastic counting process {N(t), t ≥ 0} that
satisfies four key conditions (1-4) mentioned in Definition 8.4. These
conditions essentially define a unique process with independent and
stationary increments, a constant rate of occurrence (parameter A), and
negligible probability of more than one event in a short interval as
time approaches zero. The number of events in a given time interval
follows the Poisson distribution from Section 5.3.</p>
<p>Theorem 8.7 offers a proof for the probability mass function P(t)
associated with the Poisson process, showing that:</p>
<p>P(t + h) - P(t) = e^(-Ah) * (1 - e^(-Ah) - o(h)),</p>
<p>where h represents an infinitesimally small time interval. By taking
the limit as h approaches zero and applying properties 2-4 of Definition
8.4, we derive:</p>
<p>P’(t) = AP(t),</p>
<p>which further simplifies to P(t) = e^(-At), showing that the
probability mass function for a Poisson process with parameter A is
exponentially distributed with rate parameter A. This result highlights
how the Poisson process connects to exponential distributions and
demonstrates its significance in modeling random event occurrences over
continuous time.</p>
<p>The text concludes by emphasizing that the Poisson process is crucial
in various applications, such as analyzing customer arrivals at a queue
or alpha particle emissions from radioactive materials. Understanding
this process allows researchers and practitioners to model and predict
event occurrences more accurately in diverse fields, including queuing
theory, reliability engineering, and stochastic simulations.</p>
<p>In summary, the main points of the provided text are: - The Poisson
process is a counting process with unique properties, defined by
conditions 1-4 in Definition 8.4. - It has independent and stationary
increments, constant rate A, and negligible probability of multiple
occurrences within short time intervals. - Number of events in an
interval follows the Poisson distribution. - Theorem 8.7 demonstrates
that for a Poisson process with parameter A, P(t + h) - P(t) = e^(-Ah) *
(1 - e^(-Ah) - o(h)), leading to P’(t) = AP(t). - This shows the
exponential distribution relationship between rate and probability mass
function in a Poisson process. - The Poisson process is widely
applicable for modeling random event occurrences, such as customer
arrivals or radioactive decays.</p>
<p>The text discusses the DNF counting problem as an example of a
computationally complex problem where traditional exact algorithms may
not be efficient. The DNF counting problem involves determining the
number of satisfying assignments for a given Boolean formula in
disjunctive normal form (DNF). An efficient approximation algorithm,
known as a Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme (FPRAS), can
provide an approximate solution with high probability using Monte Carlo
methods.</p>
<p>The challenge lies in designing an appropriate sampling procedure to
estimate the number of satisfying assignments accurately. The approach
involves generating sequences of independent and identically distributed
random samples, then using these samples to derive an approximation for
the desired quantity (in this case, the count of satisfying
assignments).</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider a DNF formula with r clauses, each containing
k literals. There are 2^k possible truth assignments for the variables
in each clause, and since there are r clauses, there are
(2<sup>k)</sup>r total combinations. The goal is to estimate this large
number efficiently.</p>
<p>A simple random sampling method would involve generating random truth
assignments for the k variables and checking if they satisfy all
clauses. However, due to the exponential growth of possible
combinations, this naive approach becomes inefficient as k and r
increase. More sophisticated techniques are needed for practical
applicability.</p>
<p>One such technique leverages rejection sampling with careful design
of acceptance/rejection criteria based on clause satisfaction. Another
strategy involves using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to
traverse the space of possible truth assignments more systematically,
focusing on regions likely to contain satisfying configurations.</p>
<p>In summary, the DNF counting problem exemplifies how Monte Carlo
methods can be applied to tackle complex combinatorial problems where
exact solutions are infeasible or computationally expensive. The core
idea involves generating a sequence of random samples and using them to
estimate the desired quantity within a specified error bound with high
probability. The efficiency of such approximation hinges on designing an
effective sampling mechanism tailored to the specific problem
structure.</p>
<p>The text discusses various applications and properties related to
martingales, specifically focusing on the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality.
Martingales are sequences of random variables where the expected value
of the next variable, given all previous ones, equals the current one.
This property is useful for analyzing stochastic processes and random
walks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Martingale Stopping Theorem</strong>: Allows computing
expectations under stopping times, provided certain conditions are met
(boundedness, finite expectation). Applied to a gambler’s ruin problem,
demonstrating that expected winnings equal zero when playing fair games,
regardless of betting strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wald’s Equation</strong>: A corollary of the martingale
stopping theorem, useful for calculating expectations when the number of
random variables being summed is itself a random variable. Applied to
Las Vegas algorithms where running time depends on repeated trials of a
randomized subroutine until correct output is obtained.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality</strong>: A tail inequality
applicable to martingales, providing an upper bound for the probability
that the deviation of a martingale from its initial value exceeds a
threshold. It’s more general than Chernoff bounds as it applies even
when underlying random variables aren’t independent. The standard form
provides a bound for deviations under specific conditions (constant gap
between successive values).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generalized Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality</strong>: Extends
the basic inequality by allowing for varying gaps between successive
martingale differences, making it applicable to scenarios where exact
constant bounds aren’t known or convenient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application of Lipschitz Functions and Doob
Martingales</strong>: A method to use the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality
effectively by identifying a function satisfying the Lipschitz
condition. This helps bound martingale differences appropriately for
application of the inequality.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These concepts are fundamental in probabilistic analysis, especially
when dealing with stochastic processes and randomized algorithms where
traditional methods like Chernoff bounds may not directly apply due to
dependencies among random variables. The Azuma-Hoeffding inequality
provides a flexible tool to handle such situations effectively by
providing concentration inequalities tailored for martingales.</p>
<p>The text discusses a book titled “Probability: A Geometric Tools,”
authored by Michael Artin, William Reid, and Joseph Silverman. The book
aims to introduce the core concepts of discrete probability for advanced
undergraduate students or beginning graduate students in computer
science, applied mathematics, and related fields. It requires only an
elementary background in discrete mathematics but offers a rigorous
treatment of probabilistic techniques used in algorithms and
computational methods.</p>
<p>The book is structured into two main halves. The first half covers
fundamental material such as random sampling, expectations, Markov’s
inequality, Chebyshev’s inequality, concentration bounds, the
ball-and-bins model, the probabilistic method, and Markov chains. This
foundation prepares readers for more advanced topics presented in the
second half of the book.</p>
<p>The second half delves into specialized subjects including continuous
probability, applications of limited independence, entropy, Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods, coupling techniques, martingales, and balanced
allocations (like the power of two choices). These advanced topics are
crucial for understanding modern computational paradigms.</p>
<p>Notably, the book incorporates numerous examples and exercises to
reinforce comprehension and practical application of probabilistic
concepts in computer science. The authors are experts in their fields:
Michael Artin is a John L. Loeb Associate Professor in Computer Science
at Harvard University; William Reid is a Professor and Chair of Computer
Science at Brown University, and Joseph Silverman holds a position as a
distinguished professor of mathematics at the California Institute of
Technology (Caltech).</p>
<p>In essence, “Probability: A Geometric Tools” serves as an essential
teaching resource for educators seeking to impart comprehensive
knowledge on probabilistic methods and their application across various
disciplines in computer science and applied mathematics.</p>

of the HUYGENS Algorithm for Scalable, Fine-Grained Clock
Synchronization</h2>
<h3 id="problem-context">Problem Context</h3>
<p>The challenge addressed by the HUYGENS algorithm is achieving
nanosecond-level clock synchronization in data centers without requiring
specialized hardware. Current solutions either offer coarse granularity
or necessitate costly hardware upgrades across the network
infrastructure. The motivation stems from the increasing need for
precise timing in applications like distributed databases, congestion
control, and software-defined networks, where clock accuracy impacts
consistency, scheduling, and performance.</p>
<h3 id="huygens-algorithm-overview">HUYGENS Algorithm Overview</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Center Features</strong>: Leverages symmetric,
multi-level fat-tree switching fabrics common in data centers, which
offer predictable propagation times bounded by 25-30 microseconds due to
bisection bandwidth and multiple paths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key Ideas</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coded Probes</strong>: Pairs of probe packets are sent with
a small inter-probe transmission time spacing. If the reception spacing
is close to this spacing, they’re considered “pure” and retained; impure
probes are discarded. This significantly enhances synchronization
accuracy by filtering out noisy data caused by queueing delays and NIC
timestamp noise.</li>
<li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</strong>: Processed pure probe
timestamps provide more accurate estimates of propagation times than
basic methods used in protocols like NTP or PTP. SVMs can handle path
noise effectively because they manage both linear and nonlinear
characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Network Effect</strong>: Utilizes the transitive property of
synchronization by comparing multiple clock pairs to detect and correct
discrepancies. A loop offset surplus method ensures that even minor
errors are minimized, with corrections evenly distributed across edges
in a synchronized network.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="components">Components</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Probing Phase</strong>: Each server probes 10-20 others
every 500µs in T-40 and every 4ms in T-1 using bidirectional probe
exchanges. Probes are pairs of UDP packets to enhance accuracy by
identifying clean paths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timestamping</strong>: In T-40, transmit timestamps are
close to transmission times; in T-1, the NIC stores transmission start
times in packet payloads for more precise timestamping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Signal Processing</strong>: Uses SVMs to derive slopes
(rate of frequency drift) and intercepts (offset) between clock pairs
from probe data. These parameters are used to estimate propagation
delays.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reference Spanning Tree (RST) Construction</strong>: Sets
up a tree with a reference node (C1), ensuring symmetric paths through
the network. Midpoint synchronization occurs at 2-second intervals,
extrapolated linearly for real-time estimates using HUYGENS-R.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loop Correction</strong>: Applies loop-wise correction to
identify and rectify inconsistencies in pair-wise clock discrepancies by
solving underdetermined equations via the minimum norm solution, which
mitigates asymmetries and noise effectively.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Clock Drift Analysis</strong>: Reveals that while most
clock pairs differ by 6-10 microseconds per second, extreme cases can
reach up to 30 microseconds/second due to temperature variations

<p>The syntax and type system for value recursion (vfix) in λ⃝are
presented as an extension to support recursive computations over values,
similar to term fixed-point constructs but focusing on expressions. The
vfix construct is denoted by <code>vfix z : A. E</code>, where
<code>z</code> is a term variable of type <code>A</code>. The typing
rules for vfix are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Γ ⊢s E ÷ B @ ω implies Γ, z : A ⊢s vfix z : A. E ÷ A -&gt; B @ ω
VFix</li>
<li>If Γ, z : A ⊢s M : A, then Γ ⊢s vfix z : A. M ÷ A @ ω VFixVar</li>
</ol>
<p>Here, <code>Γ, z : A</code> denotes an extended typing context with
variable <code>z</code> of type <code>A</code>. The rule
<code>VFix</code> states that if expression <code>E</code> computes to a
value of type <code>B</code> at world <code>ω</code>, then
<code>vfix z : A. E</code> also computes to a value of type
<code>A -&gt; B</code> (a function from <code>A</code> to
<code>B</code>) at the same world. The rule <code>VFixVar</code> states
that if term <code>M</code> is a value of type <code>A</code>, then
<code>vfix z : A. M</code> is a value of type <code>A -&gt; B</code> as
well, with <code>z</code> bound to <code>M</code>.</p>
<p>Reduction rules for vfix are defined in conjunction with expression
computation, i.e., instruction execution. Given an expression
computation <code>E @ ω 7→e F @ ω'</code> and a vfix construct
<code>vfix z : A. E</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <code>F</code> is of the form <code>letcmp y ◁N in G</code>,
where <code>N</code> evaluates to a value <code>V</code>, then:
<ol type="a">
<li>If <code>z ̸= y</code>, compute <code>G[V/y]</code> and rename
<code>y</code> to avoid capturing <code>z</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>z = y</code>, replace the variable <code>y</code> with term
<code>V</code> in <code>G</code> and renamings similar to expression
substitution (⟨V/y⟩G).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If <code>F</code> is of the form <code>cmp E'</code>, where
<code>E'</code> evaluates to a computation term <code>M</code>:
<ol type="a">
<li>Compute <code>E[M]</code>.</li>
<li>Rename variables in <code>E[M]</code> to avoid capturing
<code>z</code>.</li>
<li>Bind <code>z</code> to the resulting expression, and rename it if
necessary.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>This backpatching semantics ensures that recursive computations over
values are correctly evaluated and captured by tying a “recursive knot”
during expression computation. The main difference from term fixed-point
constructs is that vfix focuses on values rather than world effects,
thus providing a mechanism for recursive computations based solely on
value manipulation within the λ⃝language framework.</p>
<p>This chapter presents an extension to the functional programming
language Objective CAML, named PTP (Probabilistic Temporal Programming),
designed for specifying probabilistic computations. The primary
objective is to provide a clear separation between deterministic and
probabilistic computations while preserving the benefits of a typed
functional language, such as strong static type checking and code
readability.</p>
<p>PTP introduces two distinct syntactic categories: terms (for
deterministic computations) and expressions (for probabilistic
computations). Terms evaluate to regular values, while expressions
compute to samples from underlying probability distributions. The
operational semantics is defined using term evaluation and expression
computation judgments, ensuring that both types of computations remain
deterministic in nature.</p>
<p>PTP’s type system includes term typing judgments and expression
typing judgments. Type preservation and progress theorems are provided
for well-typed terms and expressions, respectively. A value recursion
construct is also introduced to facilitate recursive probabilistic
computations without introducing world-dependent types.</p>
<p>This chapter further presents a detailed implementation of PTP within
Objective CAML. The implementation extends the language’s syntax using
CAMLP4, translating it back into the original syntax before execution.
Sampling functions are represented using floating-point numbers and an
abstract data type <code>prob</code> for probability distributions. Two
functions, <code>prb</code> and <code>app</code>, facilitate building
and evaluating samples from these distributions.</p>
<p>The implementation provides Monte Carlo methods for approximate
computation of expectation queries and Bayes operation. PTP uses the
number of random numbers consumed as a metric to estimate computational
cost associated with these operations. A translator for horizontal
computations is also discussed, which allows parallel execution of
multiple independent computations simulating vertical ones, potentially
improving efficiency in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>Three applications are presented: robot localization, people
tracking, and robotic mapping. In all cases, PTP helps formulate update
equations based on Bayes filters, enabling probabilistic estimation of
robot poses and environment maps while handling uncertainties from
sensor readings. Experimental results using real-world data demonstrate
the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework.</p>
<p>In conclusion, PTP provides a clear and concise way to specify
probabilistic computations within Objective CAML while maintaining
strong type guarantees. Its implementation offers a robust platform for
developing probabilistic algorithms in robotics and potentially other
domains requiring probabilistic modeling. Despite some performance
trade-offs due to the abstraction layer, PTP’s advantages in terms of
clarity and maintainability make it an attractive choice for practical
applications.</p>
<p>The provided text discusses a probabilistic programming language
called PTP (Probabilistic Temporal Processes), which has a unique
mathematical basis built on sampling functions. This approach allows PTP
to support various types of probability distributions, including
discrete, continuous, and those that do not fit neatly into either
category, without making any syntactic or semantic distinctions among
them.</p>
<p>A linguistic framework, denoted as λ⃝, has been developed for PTP and
demonstrated with applications in robotics. The authors claim that to
the best of their knowledge, PTP is the only probabilistic language
featuring a formal semantics that has been successfully applied to
practical problems involving continuous distributions. Other
probabilistic languages capable of simulating such distributions
typically require special treatments like lazy evaluation strategies or
limiting processes.</p>
<p>The key innovation of PTP lies in its use of sampling functions,
which enable it to encompass diverse probability distributions without
strict categorization. However, the language intentionally avoids
precise reasoning about probability distributions because the authors
argue that exact reasoning is generally unfeasible due to the inherent
complexity and variability involved in such distributions. If PTP
supported precise reasoning, its expressive power would likely be
reduced, as it would only accommodate a subset of probability
distributions and operations.</p>
<p>The utility of PTP depends on the specific problem it’s applied
to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is suitable for problems that involve various types of
probability distributions and where precise reasoning is unnecessary,
such as in robotics. Robotics often utilizes inaccurate sensor readings,
making approximate reasoning via PTP adequate.</li>
<li>Conversely, PTP might not be ideal for problems that solely use
discrete distributions, as its rich expressiveness remains largely
untapped, and the approximations could be too coarse for discrete
scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<p>The text also mentions the development of both operational and
denotational semantics for PTP to further validate its status as a
probabilistic language. It acknowledges that constructing a
domain-theoretic structure for probability distributions, especially in
the presence of fixed point constructs and recursive equations, is an
open challenge. A potential solution suggested is building this
structure from a domain-theoretic model of real numbers.</p>
<p>Lastly, PTP represents an interdisciplinary effort combining
programming language theory with robotics, introducing new linguistic
frameworks like λ⃝ while setting a precedent for high-level problem
formulations to persist in implementation phases. This fusion could
inspire further integration between the two fields.</p>

<p>The text discusses the concept of expectation in probability theory,
specifically focusing on discrete random variables. Here’s a detailed
summary and explanation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Discrete Random Variables</strong>: A discrete random
variable is one that can take on a finite or countably infinite number
of values. These variables are represented by capital letters like X or
Y, while real numbers are denoted in lowercase (e.g., x or y).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expectation (Mean)</strong>: The expectation of a
discrete random variable X, denoted as E[X], is the weighted average of
the values it can take, where each value is weighted by its probability.
It’s calculated using the formula:</p>
<p>E[X] = ∑(i ∈ range of X) i * Pr(X = i)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linearity of Expectations</strong>: A fundamental
property of expectation that simplifies computation. For any collection
of discrete random variables, regardless of whether they are independent
or not, the following holds:</p>
<p>E[∑(i=1 to n) X_i] = ∑(i=1 to n) E[X_i]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jensen’s Inequality</strong>: A result stating that for
any convex function f, the expectation of f applied to a random variable
is greater than or equal to the function applied to the expectation of
the random variable:</p>
<p>E[f(X)] ≥ f(E[X])</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bernoulli and Binomial Random Variables</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Bernoulli random variable, Y, indicates success (1) with
probability p and failure (0) with probability 1-p. Thus, E[Y] =
p.</p></li>
<li><p>The binomial random variable X, representing the number of
successes in n independent experiments each succeeding with probability
p, follows a binomial distribution B(n, p). Its probability mass
function is given by:</p>
<p>Pr(X = j) = (n choose j) * p^j * (1-p)^(n-j), for j = 0, 1, …,
n</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditional Expectation</strong>: The expected value of a
random variable given another random variable or event is called
conditional expectation. It’s denoted as E[X | Y]. For discrete random
variables X and Y, with sample spaces Ω_X and Ω_Y respectively, the
conditional expectation is calculated using:</p>
<p>E[X | Y = y] = ∑(x ∈ Ω_X) x * Pr(X = x | Y = y)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications</strong>: The text provides examples of
applications including verifying polynomial identities, matrix
multiplication verification, a naïve Bayesian classifier for document
classification, and analyzing a randomized algorithm for finding minimum
cut-sets in graphs. It also touches upon the principle of deferred
decisions, which is useful when dealing with multiple random variables
in probabilistic analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The text discusses the concept of Chernoff bounds, which are powerful
tools for bounding the tail distribution of random variables. These
bounds provide exponentially decreasing limits on the probability that a
random variable deviates from its expectation by more than a certain
amount. The Chernoff bounds are derived using Markov’s inequality and
the moment-generating function (MGF) of a random variable.</p>
<p>The chapter starts with an introduction to moment-generating
functions (MGF), defining it as E[etX] for a random variable X. MGFs
capture all the moments of a random variable, and its derivatives at t =
0 give the moments of the distribution. Theorem 4.1 states that under
suitable conditions, E[Xn] equals the nth derivative of MX(t) evaluated
at t=0.</p>
<p>The main focus is on developing Chernoff bounds for the sum of
independent Poisson trials (or more generally, a sequence of independent
Bernoulli random variables). This includes cases where trials have
different success probabilities. Let X1, …, Xn be these independent
trials with Pr(Xi = 1) = pi; then, let X = ∑(i=1 to n) Xi and μ = E[X] =
∑(i=1 to n) pi.</p>
<p>The Chernoff bounds are given by: 1. For any δ &gt; 0, Pr(X ≥ (1 +
δ)μ) ≤ exp((δ/(1 + δ))(1 + δ)μ). 2. For 0 &lt; δ ≤ 1, Pr(X ≥ (1 + δ)μ) ≤
exp(-μδ^2/3). 3. For R ≥ 6μ, Pr(X ≥ R) ≤ 2^-R.</p>
<p>These bounds provide tighter controls over the tail probabilities of
sums of random variables compared to Chebyshev’s inequality. The proofs
rely on Markov’s inequality and the MGFs of individual trials Xi. For
independent Poisson trials, their product yields the MGF for the sum X.
By choosing t appropriately (for instance, ln(1 + δ) or ln(1 - δ)), one
obtains the desired Chernoff bounds.</p>
<p>The text also touches on an example involving coin flips to
illustrate how Chernoff bounds outperform Chebyshev’s in this context.
It concludes with a discussion of parameter estimation from samples,
where a confidence interval is constructed using Chernoff bounds to
provide a probabilistic guarantee for the true parameter being within
the given range.</p>
<p>Additionally, the text hints at obtaining even stronger bounds for
specific cases involving symmetric random variables that take values 1
or -1 with equal probability. These special-case bounds are not detailed
but mentioned as an extension of Chernoff bounds.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explore the balls-and-bins problem as a
foundation for analyzing random processes involving independent trials.
The primary focus is on understanding the distribution of balls across
bins when m balls are thrown randomly into n bins. We’ve shown that when
m = n, the probability that at least two people share a birthday in a
room (the birthday paradox) exceeds 50% when there are approximately 23
people. This result is derived using approximations and bounds,
including the use of moment-generating functions and Chernoff
bounds.</p>
<p>The chapter also introduces the Poisson distribution as an
approximation to binomial distributions in cases where the number of
trials (n) is large and the probability of success (p) is small, such
that np remains constant. We’ve demonstrated that for large n, the
binomial distribution approaches a Poisson distribution with parameter μ
= np.</p>
<p>We’ve further developed Chernoff bounds for Poisson random variables,
enabling us to estimate tail probabilities effectively. This leads to
Theorem 5.7, which states that expected values of functions over
balls-and-bins outcomes in the exact case (throwing m balls into n bins)
are bounded by those over the Poisson approximation multiplied by
e√m.</p>
<p>A crucial result is Corollary 5.9, indicating that probabilities of
events in the Poisson approximation are upper bounds for their
counterparts in the exact case when considering monotonic functions of
bin loads. This allows us to use the Poisson analysis as an upper-bound
tool for understanding exact balls-and-bins scenarios.</p>
<p>One practical application discussed is the coupon collector’s
problem, restated as a balls-and-bins problem where coupons represent
bins and cereal boxes represent balls. The expected number of cereal
boxes needed to collect all n types (nH(n)) can be approximated using
Stirling’s formula for factorials and is asymptotically equivalent to n
ln n. We also showed that, with high probability, the number of cereal
boxes required is within a constant factor of this expectation when n ln
n + cn cereal boxes are purchased (where c is a constant).</p>
<p>The Poisson approximation’s utility extends beyond these examples,
offering a tractable means to analyze dependent random processes in
algorithm design and other computational contexts. Theorems 5.10 and
5.13 leverage this approximation to sharpen results about the coupon
collector’s problem, demonstrating how understanding distributional
properties can lead to more precise estimates of behavior in practical
scenarios involving randomness.</p>
<p>The text discusses various applications of the probabilistic method
in computer science, particularly in graph theory and algorithms. Here’s
a summary of the main points and explanations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Basic Counting Argument</strong>: Used to prove the
existence of objects with certain properties by constructing a
probability space where a random object has those properties with
positive probability. For instance, it was shown that edges of a
complete graph K_n can be 2-colored such that there’s no monochromatic
K_k subgraph when k ≤ n^(1/2).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expectation Argument</strong>: Employed to prove the
existence of objects satisfying specific properties. It demonstrates
that given an expectation μ for a random variable, both Pr(X ≥μ) &gt; 0
and Pr(X ≤μ) &gt; 0 hold true, ensuring at least one instance in the
sample space meets the desired criteria. This method was applied to show
that any graph with m edges has a cut with at least m/2 edges by
randomly coloring edges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Derandomization using Conditional Expectations</strong>:
The probabilistic method can be converted into deterministic algorithms
by employing conditional expectations. For example, a Las Vegas
algorithm was derived for finding a large cut in a graph, ensuring
polynomial-time expected runtime for construction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sample and Modify</strong>: Involves constructing a
random structure without the desired properties first, then modifying it
to satisfy those properties. This approach was exemplified by proving
that connected graphs with at least n/2 edges have independent sets of
size ≥n^2/(4m).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Second Moment Method</strong>: Provides an alternative
way to apply the probabilistic method, especially useful when dealing
with integer-valued random variables. This approach was illustrated by
showing threshold behavior in random graphs G_n,p regarding clique sizes
based on edge density and average degree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conditional Expectation Inequality (Theorem
6.10)</strong>: Offers an upper bound for the probability that a sum of
Bernoulli random variables equals zero, given their expectations and
variances. This was applied to refine the proof of threshold behavior in
random graphs G_n,p.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lovász Local Lemma (Theorem 6.11)</strong>: A powerful
tool for proving existential statements about objects with specific
properties by ensuring a nonzero probability of satisfaction when
sampled from an appropriate space. The lemma was used to prove that if
no variable in a k-SAT formula appears in more than T = 2<sup>k/4</sup>k
clauses, the formula has a satisfying assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit Constructions Using the Local Lemma</strong>:
While the lemma proves existence, it doesn’t guarantee efficient
algorithms. However, it can be leveraged to derive explicit
constructions in certain cases. For example, an algorithm was described
for k-SAT where variables are divided into phases, with phase one
handling a subset efficiently and phase two using exhaustive search on
remaining variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the probabilistic method, alongside techniques like
expectation arguments, derandomization via conditional expectations,
sample-and-modify strategies, the second moment method, the Lovász Local
Lemma, and its applications in explicit constructions, provide essential
theoretical foundations for understanding algorithms and proving
existence results in computer science and discrete mathematics.</p>

Summary and Explanation of Parrondo’s Paradox and Markov Chain
Analysis</h2>
<p>Parrondo’s paradox presents an interesting scenario where two losing
games can be combined to create a winning game, seemingly contradicting
the adage “two wrongs don’t make a right.” The analysis involves
understanding Markov chains and their properties. Let’s delve into how
Markov chains are applied to understand this paradox:</p>
<h3 id="basic-setup-of-games">Basic Setup of Games</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Game A</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Involves flipping a biased coin (coin a) that lands heads with
probability ( p_a &lt; 0.5 ) and tails with probability ( 1 - p_a
).</li>
<li>You win $1 if it’s heads; you lose $1 if it’s tails. This is clearly
a losing game for the player, as the expected loss per game is negative
(e.g., for ( p_a = 0.49 ), loss is approximately 2 cents).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Game B</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Also involves flipping coins but depends on previous outcomes. You
use coin b if your current winnings are a multiple of 3, and coin c
otherwise.</li>
<li>Coin b lands heads with probability ( p_b ) (e.g., 0.09), tails with
( 1 - p_b = 0.91 ).</li>
<li>Coin c lands heads with probability ( p_c ) (e.g., 0.74), tails with
( 1 - p_c = 0.26 ).</li>
<li>Initially, it seems advantageous since the winning probability for
coin b is higher than that of coin c when their respective conditions
are met.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="analysis-using-markov-chains">Analysis Using Markov Chains</h3>
<p>To analyze these games rigorously:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>State Representation</strong>: Represent the winnings as
a state in a Markov chain over ({-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2}).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Equations for Game B</strong>: Set up equations based on
transitions between states to determine probabilities of reaching (-3)
before (3), giving: [ z_i = (1-p_c)z_{i+1} + p_c z_{i-1} i = -2, -1, 0,
1, 2 ] With boundary conditions ( z_{-3} = 1 ) and ( z_3 = 0 ). Solving
this system yields: [ z_0 = ] In the example given, for ( p_b = 0.09 )
and ( p_c = 0.74 ), ( z_0 ), indicating a losing game.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stationary Distribution (Game B)</strong>: The stationary
distribution provides the long-term probability of being in each state:
[ _i = ] This probability is compared to 0.5 to determine if it’s a
winning game. For the specific parameters, it’s less than 0.5,
confirming it’s losing.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="combining-games-parrondos-game-c">Combining Games (Parrondo’s

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Game C</strong>: Decides between A and B based on an

</ul></li>
<li><p>To analyze, set up the transition probabilities using both games
and consider all paths: [ (s) = p_d^{t_1} (1 - p_d)^{t_2} p_a^{t_3} (1 -

in 3 before -3 to those mapping in reverse order, negating
transitions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mapping and Lemma</strong>: By creating a bijective
mapping between sequences of games A and B (e.g., ( s ) to ( f(s) )),

</ul>
<h3 id="results-from-markov-chain-analysis">Results from Markov Chain

<ul>
<li><strong>Game B</strong>: Losing game with ( z_0 &lt; 0.5 ).</li>
<li><strong>Game C</strong>: Initially appears to lose, but careful
analysis using the probability mapping shows it becomes a winning game
under certain conditions (specifically when ( p_b(p_c)^2/(1 - p_b)(1 -
p_c)^2 &gt; 1 )).</li>
</ul>
<p>This demonstrates how a seemingly paradoxical combination can
actually yield a winning scenario, resolved through detailed Markov
chain analysis and understanding of state transitions.</p>
<p>The text discusses the normal (or Gaussian) distribution, its central
role in probability theory and statistics, and its importance as an
empirical approximation for various real-world observable quantities.
The normal distribution is derived from the standard normal
distribution, denoted N(0, 1), which has a density function φ(z) =
1/√(2π)e<sup>(-z</sup>2/2). The cumulative distribution function,
denoted as Φ(z), is not expressible in a closed form but can be computed
numerically.</p>
<p>The general univariate normal distribution, denoted N(μ, σ²), is
characterized by two parameters: μ (mean) and σ² (variance). The density
function for this distribution is given by fX(x) =
1/√(2πσ)e<sup>(-((x-μ)/σ)</sup>2/2).</p>
<p>The text further discusses the central limit theorem, which states
that under general conditions, the distribution of the average of a
large number of independent random variables converges to the normal
distribution. It also mentions maximum likelihood estimates for the
parameters of the normal distribution and the application of the
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to analyze mixtures of Gaussian
distributions.</p>
<p>The chapter focuses on the theoretical foundations and properties of
the normal distribution, which is crucial in probability theory,
statistics, and various applications including machine learning.</p>
<p>The text presents two main results related to entropy, randomness,
and information theory. The first result (Theorem 10.4) establishes an
extraction function for a random variable X that is uniformly
distributed over {0, …, m-1}. This extraction function guarantees the
production of at least ⌊log2 m⌋ - 1 independent and unbiased bits, where
H(X) = log2 m measures the entropy of the distribution. The second
result (Theorem 10.5) focuses on a biased coin that comes up heads with
probability p &gt; 1/2. It claims two things for n sufficiently
large:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There exists an extraction function Ext that outputs, on average, at
least (1 - δ)nH(p) independent random bits from a sequence of n flips of
the biased coin. This result builds upon Theorem 10.4 by considering the
case of a non-uniform distribution.</li>
<li>For any extraction function Ext, the average number of bits it
outputs on an input sequence of n flips is at most nH(p). This upper
bound aligns with the entropy H(p) of the biased coin’s
distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both results highlight the crucial role that entropy plays as a
measure of randomness and its importance in information theory,
particularly in encoding and decoding processes. The extraction
functions ensure the generation of independent and unbiased bits from
potentially biased sources, with bounds directly related to the source’s
entropy.</p>
<p>The text discusses various aspects of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods and coupling techniques for bounding the rate of convergence.
Here’s a detailed summary:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Monte Carlo Method and Approximation</strong>: The
chapter explains that the Monte Carlo method is used for estimating
values by sampling, often to approximate difficult-to-compute quantities
such as the number of satisfying assignments in a Boolean formula or the
expected price of a stock. An (ε, δ)-approximation means that an
algorithm’s output is within ε of the true value with probability at
least 1 - δ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DNF Counting Problem</strong>: The challenge is to count
the number of satisfying assignments for DNF formulas efficiently, which
is shown to be ♯P-complete and thus likely not solvable in polynomial
time. An FPRAS for this problem is constructed using a specific sampling
scheme that selects satisfying assignments uniformly at random while
avoiding redundant computations on non-satisfying assignments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>From Approximate Sampling to Approximate
Counting</strong>: A general reduction demonstrates how an almost
uniform sampler can be leveraged to create an FPRAS for counting
solutions in a self-reducible problem class, using independent sets in
graphs as an example. The reduction uses the ratio of successive sample
sizes to approximate the overall quantity being counted.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Method</strong>: MCMC is
a general approach for sampling from desired probability distributions.
It involves defining a Markov chain with states corresponding to the
problem’s solution space, where transitions respect the problem’s
structure, and ensuring that the chain’s stationary distribution matches
the target distribution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coupling of Markov Chains</strong>: Coupling is a
technique for bounding the rate at which a Markov chain converges to its
stationary distribution (mixing time). Given two copies of a Markov
chain running concurrently, a coupling ensures that they couple after a
finite number of steps with high probability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Variation Distance and Mixing Time</strong>: Variation
distance quantifies how far apart two probability distributions are,
crucial for defining (ε, δ)-approximations. The mixing time τ(ε) is the
time until this distance falls below ε.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coupling Lemma</strong>: This lemma shows that if a
coupling exists such that after some number of steps the chains’ states
are likely to coincide, then the mixing time can be bounded directly by
that step count.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examples</strong>: The chapter provides various examples
demonstrating coupling techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffling cards: A coupled Markov chain achieves convergence within
logarithmic time in terms of the number of cards and desired
approximation accuracy.</li>
<li>Random walks on hypercubes: Coupling reduces the problem to the
coupon collector’s problem, with mixing times bounded polynomially in
dimensions and desired accuracy.</li>
<li>Independent sets of fixed size: A coupled Markov chain ensures rapid
convergence when the size of independent sets is appropriately
restricted relative to graph degree.</li>

</ol>
<p>The text discusses the concept of sample complexity, focusing on
martingales, the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, and their applications to
various problems involving randomized algorithms and probabilistic
models. Here’s a detailed summary and explanation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Martingales</strong>: A sequence of random variables Z0,
Z1, …, is a martingale with respect to another sequence X0, X1, … if it
meets three conditions: (a) each Zi is a function of X0, X1, …, Xi; (b)
E[|Zi|] &lt; ∞ for all i; and (c) E[Zi+1 | X0, …, Xi] = Zi. Martingales
represent refined estimates of a random variable as more information
becomes available, like predicting the outcome of a sequence of fair
games based on past results.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Doob Martingale</strong>: A Doob martingale is
constructed using random variables Y and X, where Zi = E[Y | X0, …, Xi].
This represents conditional expectations gradually refining an estimate
of Y as more information (Xi) about X becomes available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Martingale Stopping Theorem</strong>: If Z0, Z1, … is a
martingale with respect to X1, X2, …, and T is a stopping time for {Zi},
then E[ZT] = E[Z0]. This theorem applies under conditions such as
boundedness of Zi or T, or specific conditions on differences between
consecutive Zi values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wald’s Equation</strong>: A corollary of the martingale
stopping theorem states that for independent identically distributed
random variables X1, …, Xn and a stopping time T for this sequence:
E[Σ_i=1^T Xi] = E[T] * E[X]. This equation helps compute expected values
of compound stochastic processes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Azuma-Hoeffding Inequality</strong>: A generalization
allowing bounded differences (c) between consecutive martingale terms:
Pr(|Zt - Z0| &gt;= λ) &lt;= 2exp(-λ^2 / (2 Σ_k=1^t c_k^2)). This
provides concentration bounds for sums of dependent random
variables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Applications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern Matching</strong>: Proving concentration results for
the longest common subsequence problem using martingales.</li>
<li><strong>Balls and Bins</strong>: Bounding sample complexity for
balls thrown into bins, improving upon previous methods by more
accurately capturing dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Chromatic Number</strong>: Applying martingale techniques to
estimate the chromatic number of random graphs with high
probability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The chapter concludes by exploring VC dimension as a measure of range
space complexity and its implications for sample complexity, linking it
back to learning problems and PAC framework analysis. The
Azuma-Hoeffding inequality is particularly useful for providing
concentration bounds even when dealing with dependent random variables,
thus facilitating rigorous probabilistic algorithm analysis.</p>
<p>Power law distributions are a family of probability distributions
characterized by a power-law relationship between the frequency of an
event and some measure of its size or magnitude. Unlike many other
common distributions such as Gaussian distributions, power law
distributions can have infinite variance, which means that extreme
events (outliers) occur with higher probabilities compared to
distributions with finite variance.</p>
<p>Power laws arise naturally in various phenomena in computer science
and beyond:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Word Frequency in Text</strong>: The distribution of word
frequencies in large corpora, like books or all text on the internet,
often follows a power law. Rare words occur much less frequently than
common ones; a few very frequent words (like “the”, “of”, “and”)
constitute a significant portion of total occurrences, while there are
many less common words each appearing only a handful of times.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>City Sizes</strong>: The distribution of city sizes
globally follows a power law, often referred to as Zipf’s Law. A few
large cities have disproportionately more inhabitants compared to
smaller cities, with the population of cities decreasing according to an
inverse square law when plotted against rank.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Income Distribution</strong>: In many economies, income
distribution approximates a power law, with a small percentage of
individuals holding a disproportionate share of wealth. This is often
modeled using Pareto distributions, which are specific forms of power
laws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network Degree Distributions</strong>: In network
analysis, the degree (number of connections) of nodes in many real-world
networks (like social networks or the internet) follows a power law
distribution. A few nodes have many connections, while most nodes have
very few.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Power law distributions can pose unique challenges for traditional
probabilistic methods, particularly those that rely on concentration
inequalities. These inequalities often assume finite variance and do not
directly apply to power laws. Consequently, alternative techniques—often
involving heavy-tailed probability theory—are necessary when analyzing
algorithms or systems where data follows such distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Key Properties of Power Law Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Heavy Tails</strong>: The right tail (high values) of a
power law distribution decreases as a power law with exponent less than
-1, meaning there is a non-negligible probability that the outcome takes
on very large values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scaling Behavior</strong>: Power laws display
self-similarity across scales; if you zoom into a segment of data, it
looks similar to the whole dataset. This property is associated with
fractal and scale-free structures in various systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications for Algorithms and Systems</strong>:</p>
<p>When dealing with power law distributions, algorithms and system
designers must consider:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Robustness to Outliers</strong>: Algorithms should be
designed to handle extreme or outlier events that occur more frequently
than in Gaussian-like distributions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: In distributed systems, if node
degrees follow a power law (scale-free networks), a few nodes may become
overloaded with connections while most remain underutilized. Load
balancing strategies must account for this skewed distribution to avoid
bottlenecks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error Analysis</strong>: Traditional probabilistic bounds
like Hoeffding or Chernoff inequalities might not apply directly, and
one needs to use heavier tail-based concentration inequalities tailored
for power laws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modeling and Prediction</strong>: Power law distributions
can provide insightful models for understanding various real-world
phenomena but also necessitate caution when extrapolating from limited
observed data, as the tails of these distributions extend
infinitely.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, power law distributions are crucial to understanding a
broad range of natural and engineered systems. Their unique properties
demand careful consideration in algorithm design and analysis,
especially when dealing with extreme events or outliers that can
significantly impact system performance and behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-two-choices">The Power of Two Choices</h2>
<p>In this section, we explore a variant of the classic balls-and-bins
problem where each ball has multiple (in this case, two) possible
destination bins. Initially, when a ball is introduced, it chooses one
of its d options randomly and places itself in the least full bin at
that moment, with ties broken arbitrarily.</p>
<h3 id="upper-bound-on-maximum-load">Upper Bound on Maximum Load</h3>
<p>Theorem 17.1 states that for this balanced allocation process with
<span class="math inline">\(d \geq 2\)</span> choices per ball: - The
maximum load (the most balls in any single bin) after all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls have been placed is <span
class="math inline">\(\leq \frac{\ln n}{\ln d} + O(1)\)</span> with
probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - o(\frac{1}{n})\)</span>.</p>
<p>This result is achieved by carefully constructing sequences <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_i\)</span> that bound the number of bins
with at least <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> balls. The core
idea involves using heights of balls as a proxy for load, and then
applying Chernoff bounds to manage dependencies among balls placed after
an initial stage where bin loads are relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="lower-bound-on-maximum-load">Lower Bound on Maximum Load</h3>
<p>Theorem 17.4 provides a matching lower bound: - With probability
<span class="math inline">\(1 - o(\frac{1}{n})\)</span>, the maximum
load is at least <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ln n}{\ln d} -
O(1)\)</span> for constant <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p>This result, like its upper bound counterpart, uses random graph
theory to model the problem. Here, each ball’s two choices correspond to
edges in a random graph, and the process of moving balls to minimize
load translates into exploring connected components that are either
trees or contain only cycles.</p>
<h3 id="cuckoo-hashing">Cuckoo Hashing</h3>
<p>Cuckoo hashing is an extension of multiple-choice hashing schemes
where items can be moved from their current location if necessary when
inserting a new item, aiming for better balancing of loads across
available slots (bins). We analyze cuckoo hashing using random graph
models.</p>
<h4 id="key-points-on-cuckoo-hashing">Key Points on Cuckoo Hashing:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Graph Representation</strong>: Items are vertices; edges
represent potential placements. Each vertex connects to two other
vertices chosen uniformly at random.</li>
<li><strong>Connected Components</strong>: Analyzed for size bounds,
showing that with high probability, no component has more than <span
class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> nodes, and the expected
component size is constant.</li>
<li><strong>Component Structure</strong>: Components are either trees or
contain a single cycle (unicyclic). This ensures successful placement of
items using a rehashing strategy if necessary, balancing insertion time
complexity against failure probability.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Failures</strong>: Introduces stashes to
temporarily hold displaced items during rehashing, with negligible
impact on expected performance.</li>
<li><strong>Extending Cuckoo Hashing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Deletions</strong>: With random deletions, failure
probability remains <span
class="math inline">\(O(\frac{1}{n})\)</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Rehashing</strong>: Balances the increased complexity
against significantly lowered failure probabilities when rehashing is
employed.</li>
<li><strong>More Choices and Larger Bins</strong>: Discusses how varying
choices per item or items per bin can be handled, potentially allowing
for larger load capacities (approaching 0.97 with certain
configurations).</li>

the Chaos Gently: Predictive Alignment Learning Rule in Recurrent Neural
Networks</h3>
<p>This article by Asabuki and Clopath introduces a novel learning
framework called “predictive alignment” designed for recurrent neural
networks. The primary challenge addressed is managing complex, chaotic
spontaneous activity inherent in these networks, especially during
initial stages of learning.</p>
<h4 id="key-innovations">Key Innovations:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Predictive Alignment Framework</strong>: Unlike
traditional methods that minimize output errors directly, this framework
aims to align the network’s recurrent predictions with its chaotic
dynamics, thereby suppressing chaos efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Biologically Plausible Plasticity Rule</strong>: The
proposed learning rule adheres to local plasticity rules, depending only
on pre- and post-synaptic activities and their predicted activities
without needing non-local information or fast synaptic changes, making
it more biologically plausible compared to existing recurrent learning
methods like FORCE.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Versatility in Learning</strong>: The model is
demonstrated to be capable of supervised learning for various tasks
including low-dimensional attractors, delay matching (requiring
short-term memory), and even high-dimensional dynamic movie
clips.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="methodology">Methodology:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The recurrent network consists of rate-based units with two types of
connections: plastic yet initially weak (<code>M</code>) and strong,
fixed (<code>G</code>). Initial chaotic activity is generated by
<code>G</code>.</li>
<li>Learning occurs through minimizing a cost function that balances
prediction error between feedback signals and recurrent dynamics while
aligning predictive and chaotic activities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="results-significance">Results &amp; Significance:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient Chaos Suppression</strong>: Predictive alignment
effectively tames chaotic activity via local plasticity, allowing
learning on local, biologically realistic timescales.</li>
<li><strong>Versatile Learning Capabilities</strong>: The model
demonstrates its ability to learn diverse target signals—complex
low-dimensional attractors, temporal memory tasks, and high-dimensional
spatial-temporal patterns in video sequences—without direct output
clamping seen in methods like FORCE.</li>
<li><strong>Biological Relevance</strong>: Predictive alignment
hypothesizes that local predictions within circuits can guide powerful,
robust, and generalizable learning, potentially offering insights into
neural computation mechanisms in reinforcement learning scenarios where
prediction and reward signals might interact.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="limitations-future-directions">Limitations &amp; Future
Directions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Further experimental validation is needed to confirm if biological

<p>This study explores the interplay between time-reversal symmetry
breaking (TRSB) and topological electronic structures in iron selenide
tetrachalcogenide superconductors, FeSe1−xTex. The researchers used
zero-field muon spin relaxation (μSR), a sensitive probe for TRSB, to
map the electronic phase diagrams of these superconductors and
investigate their bulk properties.</p>
<p>Key findings: 1. For Te composition x = 0.64 with the highest Tc =
14.5 K, spontaneous magnetic fields were detected below Tc distinct from
a magnetic order, indicating a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk.
This convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with
topologically non-trivial electronic structures signifies the emergence
of a Dirac gap within the topological surface state (TSS). 2. FeSe1−xTex
offers an attractive platform for studying synergy between topological
superconductivity and TRSB due to its relatively high Tc and tunable
Fermi level through chemical substitution. 3. The authors compared their
findings with magnetic topological insulators, where doping with
magnetic elements or creating heterostructures with magnetic materials
breaks time-reversal symmetry and induces a Dirac gap. This leads to
various exotic phenomena like the quantum anomalous Hall effect and
topological electrodynamics. 4. They discovered that FeSe1−xTex (x =
0.64) hosts bulk TRSB superconductivity without signs of magnetic order,
suggesting a novel TRSB superconducting state intertwined with
nontrivial band topology. The study also reported larger relaxation in
the spin-rotation mode for x = 0.64, which is more sensitive to internal
fields along the c-axis, supporting theoretical proposals about possible
TRSB pairings leading to large spontaneous fields in tetragonal
FeSe1−xTex.</p>
<p>The research sheds light on the intriguing interplay between
time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial topological electronic
structures in superconductors, offering a promising avenue for exploring
exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect within a
tunable material system.</p>

Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Estimation-uncertainty affects decisions with
and without learning opportunities</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Reinforcement Learning Paradigm</strong>: This study
investigates how estimation uncertainty, which is inversely related to
an option’s sampling rate during reinforcement learning, influences
decision-making not just during learning but also afterward without
further feedback or learning opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experiment Design</strong>: Participants performed a
probabilistic reinforcement learning task divided into two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning Phase</strong>: Participants learned to associate
different stimuli with rewards and punishments across various
conditions, each differing in the probability of receiving appetitive
(positive) or aversive (negative) feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Test Phase</strong>: No feedback was provided as
participants chose between pairs of previously learned options from
mixed conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Main Results</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimation uncertainty acquired during the learning phase continued
to affect decisions in the test phase, specifically influencing choices
involving less rewarded or uncertain (‘Bad’) options more than those
with high rewards and low uncertainty (‘Good’ options).</li>
<li>Computational model fits were significantly improved by
incorporating estimation uncertainty, particularly for options that had
been sampled fewer times (higher estimation uncertainty).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Replication</strong>: The results were replicated in two
independent datasets further confirming the robustness of the
findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behavioral Model Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Kalman-filter learning model, which considers both expected values
and estimation uncertainty, provided the best fit to behavior during
both phases (learning and test).</li>
<li>Models without estimation uncertainty did not capture decision
biases as effectively, especially for less certain options in the test
phase.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The study underscores that estimation uncertainty is a crucial
factor when understanding human decision-making beyond the context of
ongoing learning.</li>
<li>It suggests that decisions rely on more than just outcome
expectations; the frequency an option has been sampled (i.e., its
sampling rate or estimation uncertainty) plays a significant role,
particularly in guiding choices for unreliable options.</li>
<li>These findings have implications for interpreting behavioral tasks
used to study neurological conditions, genetic predispositions, and
mental disorders, indicating that the contribution of estimation
uncertainty must be accounted for to achieve accurate
interpretations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Behavioral Experiments</strong>: Participants performed a
task involving choices between options with varying reward
probabilities, where feedback was available during learning but not in
testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: A combination of standard
statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze
participant behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model Validation</strong>: Behavioral models were
validated using protected exceedance probabilities and model frequencies
obtained from hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI), ensuring both
group-level statistics and individual-level parameter recovery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replication</strong>: Two independent datasets (each with
100 participants) were analyzed to confirm the initial
findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Additional Analyses</strong>: Supplementary analyses
explored differences in decision weights across training and test
phases, the enhancement of model fits by incorporating estimation
uncertainty, replication of small magnitude effects observed during
learning, and modeling performance in excluded experiments from another
study.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>This research demonstrates that estimation-uncertainty is a
significant factor influencing decisions even without potential
information gains, expanding our understanding of reinforcement
learning’s role in motivated behavior. The inclusion of estimation
uncertainty in behavioral models enhances their predictive power and
interpretability, particularly for complex decision-making scenarios
involving uncertain or unreliable options.</p>

<p>The article presents a novel bi-directional thermoregulation fabric
(Bi-DTF) designed to maintain a comfortable body-textile microclimate by
balancing temperature and humidity. This fabric is engineered using
hierarchical structural strategies that minimize chain aggregation,
enhance functional particle compatibility, and establish dynamic
stress-dissipative networks for improved robustness of composite fibrous
membranes.</p>
<p>Key features of the Bi-DTF include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Active thermoregulation through incorporation of phase change
materials (PCMs) and thermal conductive nanomaterials. The PCM layer
(PC-M) absorbs and releases heat during phase transitions, while the
thermal conductive layer (TC-M), doped with boron nitride nanosheets,
facilitates efficient heat transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>Moisture permeability: Bi-DTF utilizes Janus wettability with
hydrophilic PC-M and hydrophobic TC-M to manage water transport
effectively. This design prevents skin discomfort from sweat
accumulation during physical activities while inhibiting external
moisture penetration.</p></li>
<li><p>Durability: The Bi-DTF demonstrates high tensile strength (12.7
MPa) and elastic recovery, maintaining structural integrity even after
50 washing cycles and 500 rubbing cycles. Its physical bonding between
fibers prevents inter-fiber slip, contributing to its exceptional
mechanical performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term stability: The fabric retains up to 95% of its mass and
shape after 2000 standard friction cycles, showcasing remarkable
abrasion resistance. Moreover, it maintains its function and appearance
even after 50 standard washes with minimal weight loss and
deformation.</p></li>
<li><p>Self-adaptive properties: Bi-DTF efficiently responds to dynamic
temperature changes. It absorbs heat during high-temperature
environments and releases it in low-temperature settings, thus keeping
the body-textile microclimate within a comfortable range. The fabric’s
maximum thermal temperature difference is only 2.3°C when switching
between heating and cooling cycles, outperforming conventional
textiles.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this study introduces an advanced Bi-DTF that
effectively addresses the challenges of maintaining body comfort by
integrating active thermoregulation, moisture permeability, durability,
and long-term stability in a single fabric. The material holds great
promise for applications in healthcare, outdoor sports, and protective
clothing due to its robust performance and adaptability to changing
environmental conditions.</p>

Explanation</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Feature-based reward learning shapes human
social learning strategies</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Reward Learning as a Unifying Framework:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The study proposes that diverse social learning strategies, such as
copying majorities or successful others, can be explained by a single,
domain-general reward learning framework. This challenges the prevailing
view that these strategies are fixed heuristics independent of
experience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Empirical Validation Across Six Experiments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Results from six experiments involving 1,941 participants
demonstrate that individuals adapt their social learning based on
experienced rewards.</li>
<li>The model, named Social Feature Learning (SFL), effectively captures
how people learn to associate social features with reward outcomes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Agent-based Simulations Demonstrate Strategy
Emergence:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Agent-based simulations show that the SFL model can give rise to key
social learning strategies across various environments by adjusting the
reliance on social cues based on reward experiences. This includes
behaviors consistent with majority bias, payoff bias, and prestige
bias.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Addressing Variability in Social Learning:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The study explains both within- and between-individual variability
in social learning as arising from random individual experiences rather
than innate biases. It emphasizes that individuals learn to copy others
when uncertain, with the degree of copying modulated by uncertainty
levels.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Model Comparison and Out-of-Sample Prediction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Quantitative model comparisons across experiments showed the SFL
model outperformed alternative accounts (fixed heuristics and value
shaping models) in explaining behavioral data. Out-of-sample predictions
further confirmed its generalizability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The Social Feature Learning Model (SFL):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Based on classic associative learning theory and modern
reinforcement learning, the SFL model posits that individuals learn to
associate social features with rewards.</li>
<li>The model learns through a linear function approximation of value
Q(s,a), where decisions are made using softmax policies based on learned
feature weights.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Experiment Design:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Experiments involved controlled computerized tasks with two or four
choice options (bandit tasks) in various conditions designed to test
alignment and misalignment between social features and rewards.</li>
<li>Participants received feedback and incentives for choices, allowing
the assessment of how they learned from rewards associated with social
cues versus non-social ones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Computational Modeling:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The SFL model was compared to fixed heuristics and value shaping
models through parameter estimation and out-of-sample prediction tests
across experiments.</li>
<li>A diagnostic task leveraging feature competition was used to verify
that the same learning mechanism operates on social and non-social
features, as predicted by the model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Agent-based Simulations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>These simulations tested whether the SFL model could generate key
social learning strategies in diverse environments characterized by
temporal variability, spatial movement, danger, competition, or varying
resource availability.</li>
<li>Results showed that the model accurately reproduced established
social learning strategies and also explained individual differences in
reliance on social information.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This research suggests a fundamental shift from viewing social
learning as fixed heuristics to recognizing it as a dynamic process
shaped by individual experiences through reward learning.</li>
<li>The findings offer a parsimonious framework for understanding human
cultural evolution, including the flexibility and variability observed
in social learning strategies among individuals and populations.</li>
<li>Future research can build upon this model to explore complex
scenarios of cultural transmission, the role of learning biases, and the

<p>This study investigates the persistence of hippocampal
representational drift in mice, exploring whether behavioural or sensory
variabilities could provide a general explanation for this phenomenon.
The researchers utilized their recently developed visual-olfactory
multisensory virtual reality system and implemented an online volumetric
plane registration method to precisely identify the same cells across
days with approximately 2-μm error in xyz planes.</p>
<p>The study first compared drift rates using laps with similar and
dissimilar running speed profiles across days, finding no detectable
difference in drift rates (Fig. 2). This supports the idea that
hippocampal drift in mice is not caused by overt behavioural variability
across days. The results suggest that, although mice’ behaviour can be
strongly affected by small sensory environment changes, the rate of
representational change in the hippocampus seems largely intrinsic
rather than externally driven.</p>
<p>To explore the influence of external factors on drift rates,
researchers controlled for both visual and olfactory cues while
introducing variable odour or visual tasks across laps and days. They
also introduced a spatial odour task where both visual and olfactory
cues were spatially tuned to provide information about reward location.
Despite these systematic changes in the sensory environment,
representational drift rates remained similar across different
conditions (Figs. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 6).</p>
<p>Further analysis revealed that neuronal excitability properties were
more correlated with place field stability over subsequent days compared
to spatial tuning or experimental signal quality features (Fig. 4).
Logistic regression classification showed that excitability features
alone could predict the destiny of place cells (stable vs unstable) over
days with a notable accuracy (69%), while omitting excitability
properties significantly reduced prediction performance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study suggests that hippocampal CA1
representational drift in mice is primarily an internally generated
phenomenon, largely driven by neuronal excitability rather than external
factors like behaviour or sensory variabilities. The findings highlight
the importance of intrinsic cellular and circuit mechanisms in
determining long-term stability in neural representations.</p>

<p>This study investigates the role of hippocampal interneurons,
specifically parvalbumin-expressing (PV) and somatostatin-expressing
(SST), in shaping memory-encoding spiking sequences during an odor-cued
working memory task in mice. The researchers used fast-frame-rate
voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) to
capture the spiking and membrane potential dynamics of these
interneurons.</p>
<p>Key findings include: 1. Interneuron firing fields were mostly
non-odor specific, and few cells displayed odor-specific sequences
similar to pyramidal cells. This suggests that PV and SST interneurons
do not encode odor identity or delay time like pyramidal cells. 2. Most
interneuron fields remained stable across days and training, with some
persisting even weeks apart. However, their firing rates showed random
fluctuations over time, independent of task engagement by the mouse or
performance improvement in the DNMS task. 3. Subthreshold dynamics of PV
and SST interneurons were examined using the genetically encoded voltage
indicator ASAP3. During odor onset, a prominent negative deflection
(hyperpolarization) occurred in both cell types, followed by
depolarization during odor spiking. This hyperpolarization was
transient, correlating with the subsequent odor-evoked firing of
pyramidal cells. 4. PV interneurons suppressed most pyramidal cells
during odors through inhibitory input. Optogenetic manipulation
confirmed that silencing PV cells during the rebound window increased
odor responses of inhibited pyramidal cells, while SST cell suppression
had minimal effects on pyramidal activity. 5. Pyramidal odor-excited
units could be divided into early-spiking (disinhibited during
hyperpolarization) and late-spiking groups (activated after
hyperpolarization). Time cells primarily belonged to the odor-inhibited
group, firing less during odors.</p>
<p>Overall, this research demonstrates that while interneurons encode
odor delivery, they do not encode odor identity or delay time. PV
interneurons play a significant role in suppressing pyramidal cell
activity during odors, enabling efficient encoding of memory-relevant
information. The study highlights the importance of inhibitory dynamics
in shaping hippocampal spiking sequences and memory processes.</p>
<p>This document is a Reporting Summary for a research article published
in Nature Neuroscience. It provides a structured summary of key
methodological details to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The
article investigates the role of interneurons, specifically PV
(parvalbumin) and SST (somatostatin), in shaping hippocampal pyramidal
cell activity during memory-related tasks.</p>
<p>The study utilizes voltage imaging in vivo to examine neuronal
dynamics in mice genetically modified to express genetically encoded
voltage indicators (GEVIs) such as ASAP3 and ASAP4, targeting PV or SST
interneurons. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings and
two-photon calcium imaging were employed for complementary data
collection.</p>
<p>Key aspects of the methodology include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Animal models</strong>: Adult male mice (8-31 weeks) of
various genotypes including PV-Cre, SST-IRES-Cre, Gad2-Cre:Ai9,
Gad2-Cre:Ai14, and wild-type strains were used for the experiments. All
procedures followed ethical guidelines and received approval from
relevant institutional committees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Behavioral tasks</strong>: Mice performed a delayed
nonmatch to sample (DNMS) task involving odor discrimination, where they
learned to remember the initially presented sample odor before being
tested with a new target odor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imaging techniques</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voltage imaging</strong>: Utilizing GEVIs ASAP3 and ASAP4 in
PV or SST interneurons, researchers captured neuronal activity through
high-speed epifluorescence microscopy at kHz frame rates. Motion
correction using NoRMCorre was applied to rectify movement
artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Electrophysiology</strong>: Neuropixel probes were employed
for multi-channel electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal
neurons in both PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, examining interneuron activity
during DNMS performance.</li>
<li><strong>Two-photon calcium imaging</strong>: Utilizing GCaMP6f in
Gad2-expressing cells to investigate the broader population of
hippocampal pyramidal cells’ responses to odor stimuli, allowing
analysis of odor cell dynamics and field formation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data processing and analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial processing for voltage imaging used Volpy pipeline in
Python, involving motion correction, background removal, spike detection
(using CNMF and SpikePursuit), and refinement of spatial ROI using ridge
regression.</li>
<li>Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Kilosort2 and Phy2.0
for spike sorting, followed by analysis in MATLAB to compute firing
rates and other properties.</li>
<li>Calcium imaging data underwent processing with CaImAn-based tools,
focusing on deconvolution and ROI segmentation of pyramidal cells from
GABAergic neurons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical methods</strong>: Various statistical tests
were employed to analyze the data, including paired and two-sided
t-tests, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon tests, parametric Watson-Williams
test, ANOVA, and F-tests, depending on the nature of the comparisons
(e.g., between cell groups, conditions, or time points).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code and data availability</strong>: Custom-written code
in MATLAB (version 2016b) was used for analyses. Pooled and processed
voltage imaging datasets are available at Zenodo
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15299606), while unprocessed data,
electrophysiology recordings, and calcium imaging datasets can be
requested from the corresponding authors upon reasonable
request.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Reporting Summary also provides detailed methodology for specific
analyses, such as determining significant firing fields, analyzing
subthreshold membrane potentials, studying relationships between
hyperpolarization features and behavioral metrics, and assessing
evolution of collective activity across days in pyramidal cells. The
comprehensive nature of this summary ensures that key aspects of the
methodology are transparent for replication and further scrutiny by
other researchers.</p>

<p>The text discusses the concept of consumerist narcissism, comparing
it to narcissistic personality disorder, with a focus on how marketing
amplifies this tendency. It explains that humans have innate desires for
certain nutrients like fat, salt, and sugar due to evolutionary history,
but these preferences are exacerbated by powerful global food industry
lobbyists promoting their products. The author also discusses the role
of marketing in shaping culture, comparing it to the spread of democracy
and religious reforms. Marketing is seen as a decentralized force that
brings economic power to people rather than being controlled by
elites.</p>
<p>The text then delves into the two faces of consumerist narcissism:
showing off and self-stimulation. It provides an example with the iPod,
illustrating how it displays status through sleek design and branding
while also serving as a personal entertainment device. A table is
presented comparing various products based on retail cost and weight to
demonstrate the relationship between material value and price. Products
are categorized into survival necessities (air, water, basic food), life
comforts (housing, transportation, clothing), fitness/status indicators
(luxury goods, status symbols), and narcissistic self-stimulation
products (psychological effects like drugs).</p>
<p>The text concludes by stating that while cost density can be a useful
metric for comparing goods, other factors such as time of enjoyment,
service costs, or raw material input costs might provide alternative
perspectives. Overall, it highlights the distinction between survival
needs and narcissistic wants in consumerist culture, emphasizing
marketing’s role in amplifying human tendencies toward self-promotion
and indulgence.</p>
<p>The text discusses the concept of conspicuous consumption and
signaling theory in the context of human behavior, particularly in
relation to attractiveness and status. It highlights that humans have
evolved to display certain traits as fitness indicators, such as
physical attributes (health, fertility, youth) and mental traits
(intelligence, personality). These signals are often displayed through
conspicuous consumption, where individuals spend money on luxury goods
and services to showcase their wealth and status.</p>
<p>The text presents a series of experiments that demonstrate how
thinking about mating can influence consumption decisions. Men,
especially those who are more promiscuous, tend to increase spending on
conspicuous luxuries and heroic benevolence when primed with mating
scenarios. Women, on the other hand, show a similar effect for
generosity-signaling conspicuous spending but not for conspicuous
consumption itself.</p>
<p>The author discusses different forms of signal reliability:
conspicuous waste (wasteful displays of resources), conspicuous
precision (well-designed and functional products), and conspicuous
reputation (badges or branding that signal status). Each form has its
advantages and drawbacks for the signaler, audience, and population.</p>
<p>The text also explores the evolutionary background of cosmetics,
explaining how certain female facial traits function as indicators of
fitness, youth, and fertility. It describes various primate species with
exaggerated facial features driven by female choice and contrasts this
with human facial features, which have been influenced equally by sexual
selection.</p>
<p>In summary, the text argues that human consumption behaviors are
deeply rooted in our evolutionary history, driven by instincts for
self-presentation, efficiency, and costly signaling to attract mates and
maintain social status. It underscores the significance of understanding
these underlying motivations to critically evaluate consumerism and its
societal implications.</p>
<p>The text discusses how individuals may attempt to display their
intelligence through various products and brands they choose. High
intelligence consumers are believed to favor brands like Acura, Aud,
BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, Smart Car, Subaru, Volkswagen, which connote high
intelligence due to complex controls, reading lights, headroom,
hard-to-pronounce names, and foreign origin. Low intelligence consumers,
on the other hand, prefer brands like Cadillac, Chrysler, Dodge, Ford,
GMC, Hummer, focusing on large mass, low down payment, dealer financing,
and high size-to-reliability ratio.</p>
<p>Openness is linked to music preferences such as Lotus, Mini, Scion,
Subaru, which are considered eccentric and foreign, while conservatism
favors traditional domestic brands like Buick, Lincoln, Oldsmobile, and
Rolls-Royce. Conscientiousness is associated with reliable cars such as
Acura, Honda, Lexus, Volvo, Toyota, valuing features like reliability,
child safety locks, anti-theft alarms, daytime running lights, and gas
mileage. Low conscientiousness consumers might prefer Jeep, Mitsubishi,
Pontiac for their high acceleration features. Agreeableness is linked to
kind and gentle brands like Acura, Daewoo, Geo, Kia, Saturn, with
ceo-friendly designs, hybrid drives, payload capacity for helping
friends move, and smiley front ends. Low agreeableness consumers might
prefer brands associated with dominance, such as BMW, Hummer, Maserati,
Mercedes, Nissan, which highlight horsepower, torque, intimidating size,
and menacing designs.</p>
<p>The text also mentions that music preferences serve as a reliable
indicator of personality traits, including the Big Five personality
factors: openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, stability, and
extraversion. This is supported by research showing significant
correlations between individuals’ self-reported Big Five traits and
their top ten favorite songs rated by independent listeners. Moreover,
musical tastes provide additional information beyond what can be gleaned
from photos or short video recordings of people, contributing to a more
comprehensive understanding of an individual’s personality traits.</p>
<p>However, marketers generally ignore these psychological constructs in
favor of demographic variables like age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and political beliefs. This approach is critiqued for its lack
of precision, as it fails to recognize the deep biological basis of
general intelligence and its strong connections with various other
traits and health indicators.</p>
<p>The text also explores educational credentialism, where university
degrees serve as an IQ guarantee. While elite universities like Harvard
and Yale use standardized tests such as the SAT to select students based
on intelligence, they downplay the connection between these tests and
general intelligence due to political pressures. Simultaneously,
alternative views of education, like the human capital perspective,
emphasize the economic benefits of acquiring knowledge and skills
through various means, including non-institutional sources such as
self-study, mentors, and documentaries.</p>
<p>Various products and services cater to displaying intelligence,
ranging from news magazines and nonfiction books to advanced technology
gadgets with complex features that require intellectual mastery to
utilize effectively. Examples include home astronomy equipment, private
pilot licenses, and online equity trading, all of which serve as
platforms for showcasing intelligence through the ability to navigate
intricate systems or make sophisticated decisions based on extensive
research and analysis.</p>
<p>Marketers often confound intelligence with wealth, status, taste,
class, or education without fully understanding the unique product
attributes valued by intelligent consumers for signaling their
intellect. The text ultimately argues that recognizing and harnessing
the power of general intelligence in marketing strategies could lead to
more accurate and efficient models of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Mass customization refers to the production of unique products for
individual customers using efficient mass-production technologies. This
approach benefits both producers and consumers; producers can reduce
waste from excess inventory, while consumers receive customized items
that accurately reflect their preferences. Mass customization is
particularly suitable for products that can be surface detailed using
digital printing or etching, mixed from standard materials, assembled
from modules, or cut from thin materials by computer-controlled
processes.</p>
<p>Examples of current mass customization include custom-printed books,
posters, T-shirts, and personalized fragrances. In the tech industry,
companies like Colorware offer customers the option to customize their
smartphones, media players, and computers in terms of color and
design.</p>
<p>Furthermore, advancements in computer-controlled manufacturing
technologies such as 3D printing have the potential to significantly
expand mass customization options. This could lead to more diverse
products like custom textiles, tailored clothing, or even personalized
gadgets designed to reflect individual needs and preferences.</p>
<p>In summary, mass customization represents a shift in production
strategies that combines the efficiency of mass-production with the
uniqueness of bespoke items. As technology advances, this approach is
expected to offer consumers more diverse options for expressing their
individuality through customized products while allowing producers to
streamline manufacturing processes and reduce waste.</p>
<p>The text outlines several proposed changes to current consumerist
societies to promote more ethical consumption, investment, charity,
social capital, and longevity of products. The ideas suggested include a
shift from income tax to a progressive, product-specific consumption tax
that accounts for negative externalities such as environmental impact,
resource depletion, and health risks. This tax system would also
encourage the purchase of durable goods over disposable ones and reward
energy efficiency in appliances.</p>
<p>Additionally, the text suggests fostering environments that promote
informal trade, reciprocity, and trust among neighbors for services
instead of formal employment. It advocates for the acceptance of diverse
local communities with their own values and norms, allowing individuals
to live assortatively with like-minded people. This approach could lead
to a more varied and fulfilling expression of personal traits beyond
current conspicuous consumption methods.</p>
<p>To ensure the preservation of essential prerequisites for free
markets – peace, rule of law, property rights, stable currency,
efficient regulation, honest government, and social norms of truth,
trust, fairness, and honor – the text emphasizes that even drastic
shifts in societal norms don’t necessarily lead to economic collapse.
Instead, markets have historically proven resilient and adaptive through
“creative destruction,” where old methods give way to new ones, allowing
for continuous evolution and improvement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the author argues for a gradual transition away from
runaway consumerism towards more meaningful and sustainable ways of
displaying personal traits while acknowledging that human impulses
toward status, respect, attractiveness, and social popularity can be
channeled to enhance life quality beyond current materialistic pursuits.
This transformation could result in a higher quality of life,
individuality, ingenuity, and enlightenment without necessitating a
return to prehistoric living conditions or uncritical acceptance of
consumer culture.</p>

<p>This study focuses on understanding the spatial organization of
cohesin and condensin within the pericentric chromatin during mitosis
using model convolution of computer simulations. The researchers found
that cohesin, responsible for sister chromatid cohesion, is evenly
distributed along a hollow cylinder with dimensions of 500 nm in
diameter and 550 nm in length, surrounding the interpolar microtubules.
Condensin, crucial for chromosome compaction, was modeled as clusters of
fluorophores aligned along the spindle axis.</p>
<p>The radial displacement of chromatin loops dictates the position of
cohesin and not condensin. Sir2, a histone deacetylase, was found to be
responsible for condensin’s axial positioning near the interpolar
microtubules. The heterogeneous distribution of condensin is best
explained by clusters along the spindle axis, contrasting with cohesin’s
uniform distribution.</p>
<p>Previous assumptions regarding cohesin gradients decaying from
centromeres or sister cohesion axes were disproven, as experimental
images did not match these models. Instead, a random distribution of
cohesin throughout the pericentric region was found to accurately
represent the observed fluorescence patterns.</p>
<p>The study highlights how the segregation apparatus employs chromatin
loops organized by cohesin and condensin to manage tension during
mitosis, providing a fine-scale structural understanding of these
essential components in maintaining genome stability.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bits in representation refers to the number of bits used to
represent numerical values within a given system or circuit, which
directly impacts precision, dynamic range, and resource
utilization.</p></li>
<li><p>In stochastic circuits, as described in Chapter 3, different bit
precisions for theta gates, CPT gates, and the normalizing multinomial
gate were explored. For instance, the CPT gate (Table 3.2) shows how
FPGA resource utilization increases with the number of possible outcomes
(k), internal bit precision (p), and conditioning bits. The normalizing
multinomial gate (section 3.3) illustrates the trade-offs between
precision (m.n) and arity (K), as seen in Figure 3-14.</p></li>
<li><p>Bit precision plays a critical role in balancing accuracy,
resource usage, and performance for stochastic systems. As detailed in
section 3.5 and Figure 3-15, 3-16, and 3-17, low bit precision (e.g.,
m=2 or m=4) can still yield accurate samples from distributions with
varying entropies (k = 10, 100, 1000) until entropy levels reach medium
to high values in very low-bit regimes.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, deterministic ﬂoating point units (FPUs), as shown
in Figure 3-18, consume significantly more silicon resources compared to
stochastic sampling elements for similar functionalities. For example, a
64-bit IEEE-754 FPU requires many more FPGA slices and lookup tables
than any of the stochastic gates discussed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while stochastic circuits can achieve high accuracy with
low bit precision, there are crucial trade-offs between performance,
resource utilization, and accuracy that designers must navigate when
choosing bit representations for their applications. Balancing these
trade-offs is an essential part of the design process in creating
eﬀicient stochastic computing systems.</p>
<p>The stochastic architecture for the Dirichlet-Process Mixture Model
(DPMM) presented here is designed to efficiently handle large datasets
by streaming data row by row, rather than requiring all data to be
present at once. This architecture is dynamic, allowing the number of
latent groups to change during inference, which is a novel feature not
seen in previous stochastic circuits.</p>
<p>The circuit consists of several key components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Input Stream: The input data, a dense binary matrix where each row
represents an observation as a binary vector, is streamed into the
system one row at a time.</li>
<li>Group Manager: This component handles the dynamic creation and
destruction of latent groups (clusters). It samples a group assignment
for the incoming row using Gibbs sampling based on previously seen
data.</li>
<li>Multi-Feature Module: For each group, this module stores the
sufficient statistics (SS) - the count of 1s (m) and 0s (n) - and
computes the conditional probability P(ci = k|{y−i}, {HPs}) for each
possible group assignment, where {HPs} represents the hyperparameters.
This computation is performed in parallel across all
features/dimensions.</li>
<li>Burst Groups List: A list that maintains the active groups, allowing
for efficient management of dynamic group creation and destruction.</li>
<li>Accumulate Across Features: Summarizes the individual feature
probabilities into a single group probability using a space-parallel
adder tree, which allows all features to be evaluated simultaneously and
their results summed in parallel.</li>
<li>Multinomial Sampler: Samples a group assignment for the incoming row
based on the computed group probabilities.</li>
<li>Output Stream: Streams out the assigned group for each row along
with the updated group statistics (m, n).</li>
</ol>
<p>The architecture leverages the conjugacy of the Beta-Bernoulli data
model and Dirichlet process prior to reduce the amount of state required
for inference. Suﬃcient statistics are stored in constant-time-access
SRAM on-device, enabling clustering of large datasets using relatively
few resources. The dynamic nature of the architecture allows it to adapt
to changes in the underlying number of clusters as more data is streamed
in, making it suitable for big-data applications.</p>
<p>The text discusses a hardware design for implementing the Dirichlet
Process Mixture Model (DPMM) using stochastic logic, which provides
significant performance advantages over traditional software
implementations. The DPMM is a nonparametric Bayesian model that can
adapt to an unknown number of clusters in data without requiring a
predefined number beforehand.</p>
<p>Key components of this hardware design include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Multi-feature module: This part of the circuit evaluates the
posterior predictive probability for each feature independently and in
parallel, using a pipelined adder tree to accumulate scores. The design
is heavily pipelined to allow single-cycle evaluation per row belonging
to each group.</li>
<li>Sufficient statistics mutation (SSMutate) module: This module
updates sufficient statistics when data points are added or removed from
groups and returns the updated values on NEWSS based on whether the data
point is being added or removed (ADD = 1 or ADD = 0). It’s heavily
pipelined with a throughput of one tick per sample.</li>
<li>Posterior predictive evaluation (PredScore) module: This module
computes log P(y*|SS, HP) using current sufficient statistics
(SUFFSTATS) and hyperparameters (HYPERS). Like SSMutate, it is also
heavily pipelined with a throughput of one tick per sample.</li>
<li>Group Manager: It tracks which entries in the sufficient-statistics
RAM are in use and enables dynamic creation and deletion of groups as
needed by the inference process. The group manager efficiently manages
group addresses for bursting using two stacks (available and used) and a
lookup table.</li>
<li>Streaming interface: This allows rapid clustering without needing to
store all data locally; only sufficient statistics need to be stored on
the device. Data is written asynchronously, with hyperparameters set via
feature control. Inference is controlled by asserting GO alongside a
command word and input group.</li>
</ol>
<p>The text also covers resource utilization for 16-feature and
256-feature circuits, as well as tests evaluating the impact of bit
precision on Kullback-Liebler divergence between true posterior
distributions and samples from the hardware designs. Experiments
demonstrate that the circuit’s performance scales well with increasing
data size and feature count, while also comparing its efficiency to
optimized software implementations on commodity hardware.</p>
<p>Finally, the paper explores perceptually plausible clustering of
handwritten digits using MNIST dataset examples at various bit
precisions, displaying clusters by their most common true class. It also
touches on supervised prediction tasks, generating ROC curves for
in-class vs out-of-class digit recognition and emphasizing the
challenges in disambiguating similar digits (e.g., 3 and 8).</p>
<p>In summary, this work successfully designs a hardware implementation
of the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model using stochastic logic, providing
significant performance improvements over traditional software methods.
The architecture leverages conditional independence among features for
parallel computation, demonstrates scalability with data size and
feature count, and achieves competitive results against optimized
software implementations on standard benchmarks.</p>

id="virtue-signaling-essays-on-darwinian-politics-amp-free-speech">virtue-signaling-essays-on-darwinian-politics-amp-free-speech</h3>
<p>The text is a collection of seven essays written by Geoffrey Miller,
an evolutionary psychologist, focusing on various aspects of virtue
signaling, mate choice, free speech, and cultural diversity.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Political Peacocks” (1996): This essay uses the concept of
sexual selection to explain political behavior, particularly in college
students who engage in protests or demonstrations. Miller argues that
this behavior can be seen as a form of courtship display to attract
mates rather than just advocating for a cause.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Handicap Principle” (1998): This is a review of Amotz and
Avishag Zahavi’s book on the handicap principle in evolutionary biology.
Miller discusses how costly signals, like sexual ornaments, can serve as
reliable indicators of an individual’s fitness. He extends this
principle to suggest that human moral virtues could also function as
such signaling mechanisms, making them attractive in a mate-choice
context.</p></li>
<li><p>“Why Bother to Speak?” (2002): In this essay, Miller explores the
evolutionary origins of language and its connection to courtship
behavior, arguing that certain personality traits and mental health
traits are attractive because they signal good genes, parenting
abilities, or partner potential. He emphasizes that language is a
complex biological adaptation with significant evolutionary benefits,
including signaling intelligence and capacity for cooperation.</p></li>
<li><p>“Sexual Selection for Moral Virtues” (2007): This paper proposes
a sexual selection model to explain the origin of moral virtues in
humans. It emphasizes how traits like kindness, bravery, honesty, and
integrity could have evolved as costly signals of an individual’s
quality rather than just arbitrary cultural constructs or altruistic
behaviors resulting from kin selection or reciprocal altruism.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Google Memo” (2017): In response to the controversy
surrounding James Damore’s memo at Google, Miller argues that much of
the criticism of the memo ignores its evidence-based claims and
misrepresents sex differences research. He posits that speech codes and
restrictive norms on college campuses discriminate against
neurodivergent individuals, like those with Asperger’s syndrome, who may
struggle to comply due to their conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Neurodiversity Case for Free Speech” (2018): This essay
discusses how speech codes on college campuses discriminate against
neurodivergent individuals and mental health disorder sufferers, as
these groups find it difficult to understand and adhere to often vague
and shifting norms of political correctness. Miller argues that these
codes impose an impossible burden on those with conditions such as
Asperger’s, ADHD, bipolar disorder, or low
agreeableness/conscientiousness, effectively silencing them.</p></li>
<li><p>“The Cultural Diversity Case for Free Speech” (2018): This essay
explores the challenges foreign students face when adapting to American
campus culture, including deciphering complex and often unwritten speech
codes and norms. Miller argues that these codes discriminate against

values despite their differing backgrounds, languages, and
experiences.</p></li>

<p>In summary, Miller’s essays present a critical analysis of virtue
signaling through the lenses of evolutionary psychology, free speech,
and cultural diversity. He argues that many contemporary social norms
and policies on college campuses, particularly those related to free
speech, often unintentionally discriminate against neurodivergent
individuals and people from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>
