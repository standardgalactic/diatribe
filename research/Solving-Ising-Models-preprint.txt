Abstract— Coupled nano-oscillators are attracting increasing interest because of their potential to perform 
computation efficiently, enabling new applications in computing and information processing. The potential of 
phase transition devices for such dynamical systems has recently been recognized. This paper investigates 
the implementation of coupled VO2-based oscillator networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems. 
The target problem is mapped to an Ising model, which is solved by the synchronization dynamics of the 
system.  Different factors that impact the probability of the system reaching the ground state of the Ising 
Hamiltonian and, therefore, the optimum solution to the corresponding optimization problem, are analyzed.  
The simulation-based analysis has led to the proposal of a novel Second-Harmonic Injection Locking (SHIL) 
schedule. Its main feature is that SHIL signal amplitude is repeatedly smoothly increased and decreased. 
Reducing SHIL strength is the mechanism that enables escaping from local minimum energy states. Our 
experiments show better results in terms of success probability than previously reported approaches. An 
experimental Oscillatory Ising Machine (OIM) has been built to validate our proposal.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Current computing platforms demand fast and energy-efficient solutions to computationally hard and data-intensive 
problems.  
Solutions to these challenges are currently being investigated from many different perspectives, including techniques 
at the physical, circuit, architectural, or system level. More breakthrough approaches to provide medium-term solutions, 
explore different devices to replace or complement the MOS transistor, as well as alternative computing paradigms. 
An active research area that merges both approaches is that of oscillator-based computing (OBC) and its 
synchronization phenomena [1]-[4]. The idea is to take advantage of the rich dynamics of coupled oscillator systems 
and implement them with compact and very low-energy oscillators enabled by emerging technologies. In particular, 
Phase Shift Key (PSK) OBC uses oscillators of ideally identical frequency, and the processing corresponds to obtaining 
a phase pattern for the oscillation phases of the coupled oscillators.  
Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are hard computational problems encountered in many areas of activity 
with great economic impact, such as finance, manufacturing, mobility, logistics, or cryptography [5]. This means that 
the development of hardware platforms that allow them to be solved more efficiently than using conventional computers 
is of great interest. It is well known that many relevant COPs can be mapped to an Ising model [6], a mathematical 
model of the statistical mechanics to study ferromagnetism. So, there are many efforts to develop efficient Ising solvers 
or Ising machines. There are already available pure CMOS digital solutions [7], but also quantum-based ones [8], which 
are referred as annealers. Research using alternative physics-based computing paradigms to keep the advantages of 
the quantum approach, but without exhibiting its disadvantages such as operating temperature, is being conducted. 
In particular, recently, PSK OBC Ising machines with coupled oscillators that exploit their dynamics of evolution towards 
a minimal energy state have been explored from different points of view. Implementations using different technologies 
have been proposed and experimentally validated. In particular, an experimental implementation of an Ising solver using 
coupled phase-transition nano-oscillators with VO2 devices has been reported [9]. Experimentally calibrated numerical 
simulations show they exhibit high energy efficiency and potential for several orders of magnitude improvement over 
CPU, GPU, quantum and photonic approaches [10].

VO2 devices have also been applied to realize associative memory functionality. The authors have developed different 
architectures for this application [11]-[16]. Based on this experience, we address now the implementation of Ising 
machines. We claim that both applications are somehow two faces of the same coin and that each one requires to be 
operated differently. Implementation features that are drawbacks for one of them can be beneficial for the other. This 
analysis leads to propose an operating protocol for oscillation-based Ising machines, supported both by simulation and 
hardware experiments.  The suitable operation of Ising machines is comprehensively addressed in [17], where an in-
depth analysis of the performance of a network of coupled stochastic injection-locked VO2 oscillators is presented in 
terms of its Lyapunov energy and its continuous-time dynamics and how the latter can be harnessed to perform classical 
annealing. On this basis, we further investigate other factors that can also affect Ising solver performance. Unlike the 
mentioned work, the simulation results correspond to transient electrical simulations using a model for VO2 devices 
which incorporates stochasticity, instead of oscillator models in the phase domain that introduce phase noise. Moreover, 
experimental validation is also carried out.  Our simulation and experimental results solving Max-Cut optimization 
problems contribute to a deeper understanding of how to operate a network of coupled oscillators as an Ising machine. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces VO2 oscillators, the applications of coupled oscillator 
systems, and the Ising machine concept. Section III is devoted to the suitable operation for the Ising machine 
application. Extensive simulations are described to introduce the different factors which impact its behavior and 
introduce a proposal for operating it. Section IV describes experiments carried out with a hardware implementation of 
an oscillator-based Ising machine to support our proposal. Finally, Section VI is devoted to the conclusions. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. VO2 oscillators 
VO2 undergoes metal-insulator transitions under given electrical stimuli. That is, abrupt switching occurs from/to a high 
resistivity state (insulating phase) to/from a low resistivity state (metallic phase). Without electrical stimuli, VO2 tends to 
stabilize in the insulating phase. When the applied voltage increases and the current density flowing through it reaches 
JC-IMT, an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) occurs. Once in the metallic state, when the voltage decreases and the 
current density drops below JC-MIT, metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) takes place. Fig 1a shows the I-V characteristic of 
a generic VO2 device. VIMT (VMIT) is the voltage at which the insulator-to-metal transition, (IMT) (metal-to-insulator 
transition, MIT) occurs. RINS (RMET) is the resistance in the insulating (metallic) state. Since MIT and IMT transitions are 
abrupt but not instantaneous, transition times (TTIMT, TTMIT) are also considered. 
For simulations, the behavioral Verilog-A model of the VO2 device reported in [18] is selected. In this work, we use the 
VO2 device with the electrical parameters shown in TABLE I [19].

Fig 1b shows a VO2-based oscillator [20], [21]. It consists of a VO2 device through which a capacitance C is charged, 
which is discharged through a resistance R. Fig 1c depicts waveforms for the oscillator output. The state of the VO2 is 
also shown to better illustrate the circuit behavior. VO2,STATE='INS' means the device is in the insulating state. 
VO2,STATE='MET' corresponds to the device in the metallic state. Assuming that the VO2 is in an insulating state (marked 
with "A" in Fig 1c), the oscillator output is discharged through the resistor. This increases the voltage drop across the 
VO2 (VDD - VOUT) and so the current through it increases. Once enough current density circulates (JC-IMT), it switches to 
the metallic state (marked with "B" in Fig 1c). Equivalently, using the electrical model, switching to the metallic state 
occurs once the VO2 voltage reaches VIMT. The capacitor is then charged through the VO2. This charging is very fast 
because of the low RMET value. The voltage seen by the VO2 decreases until it reaches VMIT and the transition from 
metal to insulator state occurs.  
 
B. Coupled Oscillator Networks 
Oscillator Based Computation (OBC) relies on the dynamics of coupled oscillator systems. It has received considerable 
interest and has become an active research area due to the emergence of devices, operating on the basis of very 
different physical phenomena, with the ability to implement very compact oscillators and with very low power 
consumption. Instead of using voltage levels as logic levels, the phase differences between an oscillator signal and a 
reference signal are used.  

Recent works have shown that almost all types of nonlinear self-sustaining oscillators are suitable to implement systems 
with the inherent convergence property towards a minimal energy state. This can be applied to implement different 
functionalities by suitably configuring the couplings so that the minimal energy states are the solutions to the target 
problem. In [22]-[23], the graph coloring problem (GC) is solved from the steady state of a network of oscillators, which 
represent the nodes, and where the branches of the corresponding graph are mapped in interconnections that push to 
separate the phases of the adjacent oscillators. Associative memory applications (AM) derive coupling strengths so that 
the patterns to be stored correspond to minimal energy states of the network.  Similarly, combinatorial optimization 
problems can be solved by coupled oscillator systems embedding the target solution into the ground state of the system. 
For this, the Ising model concept described in the next subsection is used.  
 
C. Ising Machine  
It is well-known that a wide variety of NP optimization problems can be formulated as an Ising model. An Ising model is 
a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to study ferromagnetism. It is composed of N binary spins, σi ∈ {±1}, 
and interactions between pairs of spins, Jij denotes the interaction between spin i and spin j. The Ising Hamiltonian is a 
function of the spin configuration of the system, defined as: 
𝐻𝐻(𝜎𝜎) = −∑
𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝜎𝜎𝑗𝑗   (1 ≤𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗≤𝑁𝑁)
𝑖𝑖<𝑗𝑗
          (1) 
Solving an Ising model corresponds to determining the spin configuration which minimizes H (ground state). Solving an 
Ising model is itself an NP hard problem [6]. 
A special type of computer, called an Ising machine (IM) or Ising solver, solves Ising models. Thus, it has been put 
forward as an efficient way of performing optimization. An IM solves a class of optimization problems by mapping them 
to the Ising Hamiltonian of a spin glass system and finding its ground state solution.   
In this paper, the unweighted Max-Cut problem, a well know optimization problem which can be mapped to an Ising 
model, has been selected for our experiments. A maximum cut of a graph is a partition of the vertices of the graph into 
two complementary sets such that the number of edges between them is the largest possible. The problem of finding a 
maximum cut in a graph is known as the Max-Cut problem. Formally, it can be formulated as follows. Given an 
unweighted graph G = (V, E), where V are the vertices and E are the edges between them, the solution of the Max-Cut 
problem provides a disjoint partition V1 ∪ V2 = V such that the cardinal of set E' ={(u,v), (u,v) ∈ E, u ∈ V1, v ∈ V2} is 
maximized. 
Assuming:  
 
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖= ൜1       𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖      𝑖𝑖 ∈  𝑉𝑉2
0       𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       𝑖𝑖 ∈  𝑉𝑉1                     (2) 
 
 the value of the cut can be written as: 
 
𝐶𝐶= ∑
𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 
(1− x𝑖𝑖x𝑗𝑗 )

𝑖𝑖<𝑗𝑗
= 1

𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗−1
2 ∑
𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 x𝑖𝑖x𝑗𝑗
𝑖𝑖<𝑗𝑗
 
𝑖𝑖<𝑗𝑗
  (3)   
 
where wi,j = 1 if (I,j) ∈ E and 0 otherwise. Thus, the relationship with the Ising model is evident. C can be written in terms 
of the Hamiltonian in (1):

with Ji,j=-wi,j.= -1. Note that the first term is constant and that by minimizing H, the value of cut, C, is maximized.

In [24], IMs are classified into three main categories according to their operating principle: classical annealing, quantum 
annealing, and dynamical system evolution, although different operating principles can be combined. Examples of digital 
dedicated annealers are the Fujitsu digital annealer [7], [25], the Toshiba bifurcation machine [26] or the FPGA-based 
solution reported in [27]. In the analog domain, it has been proposed to exploit the intrinsic randomness of nanodevices 
to avoid the area and energy cost associated to the pseudo-random number generators required in their digital 
counterparts, also improving the quality of randomness. For example, using magnetic tunnel junctions [28], [29]. In [8] 
a quantum annealer built by D-Wave Systems is reported. However, it suffers from various problems. These included 
the need to operate at a temperature close to absolute zero as well as the difficulty of scaling up the machine size, a 
consequence of its use of quantum techniques.  The third type of IM is based on the evolution of a dynamical system 
in which the state of the system is naturally driven towards the lowest energy state of the Ising model. In particular, 
coupled oscillators exhibit such behavior and several oscillation-based IMs (OIMs) have been proposed using very 
different types of oscillators, including optical parametric oscillators, [30]-[32], electronic conventional ones, such as 
discrete LC oscillators [33],[34],[35], ring oscillators [36], [37], differential oscillators [38] or Schmitt Trigger oscillators 
[17], as well as other built based on non-conventional devices like phase transition materials [9],[10], Ferroelectric 
transistors [39] or spin torque devices [40].   
III. OPERATING COUPLED OSCILLATOR SYSTEMS 
Each of the three applications of coupled oscillator networks enumerated in Section IIB (GC, AM, IM) requires being 
operated differently. Let us illustrate this with the simple four-oscillator system in Fig.2.   
Graph Coloring 
The graph coloring problem assigns a colour to each vertex of a graph such that any two adjacent vertices have different 
colors while minimizing the number of colors. 
The network in Fig.2 can solve the graph coloring problem corresponding to the graph in Fig.3a in which each node is 
adjacent to every other. Thus, four colors are necessary to color it.  Fig.3b depicts the simulated waveforms. Note that 
after several oscillation cycles, there are four stable phases 90º apart.

Associative Memory (AM) 
A coupled oscillator network resembles a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN). An HNN is a recurrent neural network defined 
by a symmetric weight matrix W, and an update rule. Wij denotes the weight associated with the connection between 
neuron i and j. Furthermore, in its discrete and synchronous version, each neuron state, 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖, operates with bipolar values 
(1, -1) and is updated simultaneously as: 
                          
                                  𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖= 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠(∑𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗
)    
(5) 
 
The stored patterns are those state of the system which are fixed points of (2). 
Under this model, the network in Fig.2 has the weight matrix shown in Fig 4a and it is storing any pattern with exactly 
two zeros and two ones, as depicted in Fig 4b. Using the HNN as associative memory requires applying a test pattern, 
which if it is not a stored one, should evolve towards the closest stored one. It is said to be retrieved or inferred.

Therefore, for this application, only two phases should be possible for the oscillators to represent '1' and "-1". This is 
different from the requirements of the graph coloring application. Additionally, it is critical to the initial state of the coupled 
oscillator network.  
 
 
The first requirement is achieved through Second-Harmonic Injection Locking (SHIL) [41]. When a suitable 
synchronization signal (VSYNC) of frequency fSYNC is injected to an oscillator of the natural frequency close enough to 
fSYNC/N, SHIL occurs and the oscillator adopts a frequency equal to fSYNC/N and becomes phase synchronized within 
one of N possible phases that are (360/N)º apart. N=2 is used to work with two phases. 
In these oscillators, the initialization is carried out through the pulsed bias signal, which rises from the ground to a 
constant value (VDD) after a certain delay. This delay is closely linked to the oscillation period, so that for two coupled 
oscillators, they could be initialized in phase or out-of-phase simply by making the difference between the switching 
times of their polarization zero and half a period respectively [19]. 
 
The operation of a fully connected 4-node oscillator network (Fig.2) operating as AM is illustrated in Fig.5. For this 
purpose, the grayscale input pattern shown in Fig.5a is applied, with which an output pattern as shown in the same 
figure (and also in Fig 4b) should be retrieved. The waveforms corresponding to this example are depicted in Fig.5b. 
Note how the outputs switch at different instants, corresponding to the delayed initialization according to the applied 
input pattern. As expected, outputs 1 and 2 are in one phase, while outputs 3 and 4 are 180 degrees apart. 
 
Ising Machine (IM) 
The network in Fig.2 can also be described as an Ising machine to solve the Max-Cut optimization problem for the graph 
in Fig.3a. The network is operated and the final distribution of the oscillator phases defines the two partitions. Clearly, 
SHIL is also a requirement to discretize into two possible phases.  
Clearly, a partition with any two vertices in each one is a Max-Cut of the graph under analysis. All those corresponding 
network states have the same Hamiltonian energy, and this is the minimum among all possible states. 
Fig.6 depicts waveforms for the system in Fig.2 which correspond to the Ising solver for the Max-Cut of the complete 
graph in Fig.3a. The four oscillators are initialized in phase and the system evolves towards an optimal solution (4 cuts) 
in which two oscillators exhibit one phase and the other two the complementary one. It can also be observed that after 
the application of SHIL (5s), there are only two possible phases. Note the difference with the waveforms in Fig.3, 
corresponding to the simulation of the same circuit but without applying SHIL. 
 
These simple examples have been useful to explain how depending on the operation conditions of the same coupled 
oscillator system, solutions to different problems can be obtained. Graph colouring does not require SHIL while the 
other two do. However, we claim that operation as associative memory and as Ising machine should be completely 
different. Moreover, what can benefit one application could be dramatic for the other.  
 
On the one hand, thinking in terms of the system energy landscape, configured by the couplings, can help to understand 
this statement. The system dynamics naturally evolves to states with less energy, but the system can be trapped at a 
local minimum. From the point of view of the optimization problems, this impedes obtaining the optimum solution. Unlike 
this, this local minimal can correspond to the store pattern closest to the applied test pattern. In the first case, being 
able to escape from it is positive, as it could improve the quality of the solution, but it is negative in the second one since 
a wrong pattern could be retrieved, reducing accuracy. The role of SHIL and stochasticity in escaping from local minima 
is being investigated. 
 Additionally, considering the probabilistic nature requirement of OIMs can also be useful in realizing the differences 
between both applications since a nondeterministic behavior is not compatible with the AM application. In this respect, 
noise or cycle-to-cycle variability is very well welcomed for OIMs, but should be kept under control for associative 
memory operation.  Because of this probabilistic nature, there is no guarantee that the optimum solution (or ground 
state) is reached. The probability of reaching it is called success probability and is widely used as a figure of merit in 
the performance of IMs. Thus, the performance of many trials is often reported in the literature as a mechanism to 
increase the quality of the solutions. Note that the probability of success can be closely related to the problem to be 
solved. It seems reasonable to assume that, for problems with a high number of vertices, the probability of reaching a 
local minimum is smaller than in a simpler one [10].  
 
We have designed a set of experiments to gain insight into the factors pointed out in previous paragraphs and their 
relationships to derive how to operate coupled oscillators to achieve good performance as IMs.

IV. OPERATING COUPLED OSCILLATOR-BASED IMS 
A. Analysis of factors  
To explore the role of the SHIL signal, noise, initial phase relationship, and coupling strength in the operation of coupled 
oscillators as IMs, the behavior of a solver of the Max-Cut problem in Fig 7a is further investigated. Its energy landscape 
is depicted in Fig 7b. The Hamiltonian energy for the sixteen spin configurations is shown using a Karnaugh map as a 
representation. That is, spin configurations associated with adjacent cells differ in a single spin. There are two global 
minimum energy configurations which have been marked. Any of them is a solution to the corresponding Max-Cut 
problem. As expected, these global minimum energy configurations have spins 1 and 3 at the same value, and spins 2 
and 4 take the opposite value. It corresponds to the optimum Max-Cut (cut value equal to 4) shown in Fig 7a.  To be 
successful in solving the associated optimization problem, the oscillator system should evolve to a one of those spin 
configurations.  
SHIL signal strength, noise and coupling strength are closely related. In our simulation experiments, we keep the 
coupling strength fixed and illustrate the impact and relationship of the other two.  
A key component of hardware IMs that can be fundamental in efficiently solving COPs is the internal noise of the circuit, 
which helps escape from suboptimal solutions (local energy minimum). In fact, in digital IMs, random number generators 
are used for this. Moreover, different authors have stated the critical role of inherent stochasticity in the implementation 
of IMs, which is identified with a probabilistic exploration [36],[10]. Because of this, they report that many trials are 
conducted so that the chance of obtaining the optimum solution increases. 
It is well-known and has been reported in the literature that actual VO2 devices exhibit variability in the state transition 
voltages. In [42] it is reported that VIMT exhibits variability more than seven times larger than for VMIT.  It is also reported 
that it varies stochastically for all cycles without a reduction in the mean or range and can be approximated by a normal 
distribution. Additionally, the impact of the insulating-to-metal variability in the performance of coupled oscillator systems 
is much greater than the one associated with the reverse phase transition [12]. Thus, a cycle-to-cycle variability of its 
insulating to metal voltage (VIMT) has been included in the VO2 model described in Section II.A. A normal distribution is 
associated with it. That is, VIMT changes in time following a normal distribution around its nominal value, with a given 
standard deviation denoted NOISE or noise level.  It translates in cycle-to-cycle variations in the oscillation period (jitter). 
The chosen name refers to the fact that it, not only allows us to model the experimental variability observed in said 
parameter, but also allows to capture the effect of other noise sources that

manifest as jitter in the oscillation period. Note that there is also mathematical noise associated with the integration 
algorithms and their tolerances. 
Fig 8a shows simulation results for the cut value associated with the evolution of the 4-oscillator system representing 
the graph of Fig 7a with two different noise levels. Identical initial state and synchronization signals have been used in 
both simulations. It can be observed that the system with a very small noise level becomes trapped in a local minimum 
with a cut-value equal to 2, not a maximum. The system with more noise can reach the global optimum (minimum 
energy spin configuration).  
Fig 8b depicts the result of simulations with a very small noise level and two different amplitudes for the synchronization 
signal. This experiment shows how SHIL counteracts noise. Reducing the amplitude of the synchronization signal allows 
escaping from the local minimum. That is, as already mentioned, there is a relationship between the different factors 
involved in the dynamic evolution of the coupled oscillator system. 
Another point to take into account is the SHIL signal scheduling. Different scheduling's have been proposed in the 
literature. In particular, an improvement in the success probability of reaching the optimum solution has been reported 
by linearly increasing SHIL amplitude compared to a constant SHIL [43] This has been compared to a thermal annealing 
process in which the reduction of the temperature is associated with the reduction of the stochastic noise in the system 
as a consequence of the increase in the amplitude of SHIL signal. 
 
Fig 9 illustrates the potential of using a SHIL with smoothly increases its amplitude and its impact on the system. It can 
be observed that the application of the constant amplitude SHIL signal freezes the system in a non-optimum phase 
relationship with three oscillators in one phase (cut value equal to 2). This is in agreement with [31] in which it is stated 
that the freeze-out effects associated with the discretization of the oscillator phases are a limitation for the 
synchronization dynamics. 
 
In [44], we showed results that the success probability can also be increased by delaying the application of the 
synchronization signal. In both cases, we are giving time for the system to evolve towards a minimal energy state before 
forcing a binary discretization of the oscillator phases, which occurs for an enough large SHIL amplitude. Contrary, if a 
strong enough synchronization signal is applied from the very beginning or too early, the system gets stuck in a stable 
state in the neighborhood of the initial one which, in general, can be suboptimal. That is a local minimum.

Finally, the initial state of the system (phase relationships) also impacts its dynamics. However, this has not been 
discussed to the best of our knowledge in the literature. Even if stochasticity is not considered, starting in different initial 
states can also be advantageous for improving the success probability of optimally solving the associated COP problem. 
B. Ising machine operation protocol 
On the basis of the analysis of the experiments carried out, we propose the following OIM operating protocol. 
• 
SHIL scheduling according to Fig 10.  The VMAX  parameter is the signal amplitude, and KPER controls the linear 
increment/decrement of its amplitude speed. It is measured in cycles of period, TOSC. The amplitude rises from 0 
to VMAX in KPER cycles.  The repetitive scheme of sweeping SHIL amplitude allows further exploration of the 
associated energy landscape of the Ising model, such as the use of many trials reported in the literature, and 
enables an important escape mechanism from local minimum solutions when SHIL strength is reduced. 
• 
The solution is selected on multiple readings and the selection of the best one. This aims to counteract the 
possibility of escaping a global minimum or worsening the quality of the solution. This could occur because of 
excessive noise in the system or as a consequence of SHIL strength reduction. Readings must be carried out with 
enough SHIL signal strength so that phases are binarized and so that the reading process is simplified. Readings 
are carried out around the points at which the SHIL signal reaches its maximum amplitude. Thus, how many 
readings take place depends on how long the OIM is operated (TCOMP) and KPER. 
To evaluate the proposed operation protocol, a second Max-Cut instance, depicted in Fig 11 has been used in the 
simulation experiments. Note that it exhibits critical difference with respect to the analyzed in the previous subsection 
(graph in Fig 7). The associated oscillator system presents phase contention. This means that it is not possible to fulfil 
all phase constraints imposed by the capacitors that connect pairs of oscillators in the associated IM. In addition, it is a 
non-balanced graph in the sense that nodes exhibit a different number of connections." 
The IM associated with the graph in Fig 11 has been evaluated with three different SHIL schedules illustrated in Fig 12: 
an already introduced increasing amplitude SHIL signal (SHIL1), a SHIL signal periodically switching between two 
different amplitudes (SHIL2) [45] and the proposed one (SHIL3). The multiple reading approach has been used in all 
the cases. For each of them, 20 Monte Carlo (MC) runs have been performed for each of the 64 possible initial binary 
phase combinations. MC analysis is used because of the random distribution included in the VO2 model. This 
experiment was carried out for three different values (no noise, 1mV and 10mV). Three TCOMP values were analyzed. 
TCOMP1 corresponds to 1.5 periods of the SHIL3 signal (2 readings), TCOMP2 corresponds to 9.5 periods and 10 readings, 
and TCOMP3 to 17.5 periods and 18 readings.  For selected VMAX and KPER, TCOMP1 is 12µs. VMAX=0.4V has been chosen 
so that it is strong enough to produce the desired discretization of the phases and its amplitude is similar to that of the 
oscillators themselves. KPER =20 has been selected.

TABLE II shows the number of initial system states from which an optimum solution is obtained for different computation 
times. That is, at least one of their associated 20 MC simulations obtained an optimum solution. Note that a single 
simulation is carried out when no noise is modeled. It is clear that noise is beneficial in increasing the number of 
successful initial states, although this figure of merit alone does not completely support the above statement, but the 
improvement observed (especially for the SHIL1 and TCOMP1) between 1mV and 10mV of noise also suggests this.  It 
can also be seen that the number of SHIL1 results is much worse than the other two for the shortest computation time. 
This can be explained since the capability of exploring the energy landscape and so escaping from a local minimum 
reduces once a strong enough SHIL is applied. Both SHIL2 and SHIL3 benefit from the reduction of the SHIL strength. 
When the computation time is increased, the chance of escaping due to noise is increased, and so the number of 
successful initial states for the SHIL1 experiment also increases significantly. Also, it can be observed that the noise 
level has little impact but for the SHIL1 and the shortest computation time.  This agrees with our above explanation. 
The higher the noise level increases the probability of escaping from local minima.

Much more insight into system performance can be obtained if the fraction of MC runs achieving the optimum solution 
is also analyzed. It can be considered as the success probability. A value of 1 for this figure of merit means that the 20 
runs produce an optimum solution. 
Fig 13 shows such a fraction for each of the 64 initial states versus its normalized Hamming distance to the closest 
optimum solution. A Hamming distance equal to 0 means that the initial state is an optimum solution to the associated 
optimization problem. The differences are notorious among the three SHIL schedules. On the one hand, a fraction of 
successful runs is significantly higher for the proposed SHIL (black points are over 0.8 for all the initial states) than for 
the other two. The worst results are obtained with SHIL1. The second interesting aspect to be pointed out is that the 
results are almost independent of the initial state (the 64 points have very little dispersion) for the proposed SHIL while 
this is not so for the other SHILs, especially for SHIL1. In fact, very few black points appear since many of them occupy 
the same position. This reduced dependence is also a consequence of reducing the SHIL strength during the operation, 
allowing a better exploration of the solution space.  
It is also interesting to analyze the fraction of successful runs for different computation times. In this analysis, the 
average and standard deviation over the 64 initial states have been used. A value of 1 for the average means of 1280 
(64x20) runs produced an optimum result. Fig 14 depicts the average of the success rate including bars for the standard 
deviation. Note that there are two additional computation times with respect to previous experiments (TCOMP12 and 
TCOMP23). The limitations of SHIL1 are also evident from this figure. Both SHIL2 and SHIL3 achieved better results in 
TCOMP1 than SHIL1 in TCOMP3, although TCOMP1 is around ten times shorter than TCOMP3. The smaller standard deviation 
exhibited by SHIL3 also indicates that the initial state is less relevant for SHIL3, as already pointed out when describing 
Fig 13.  
In [10], the Max-Cut problem depicted in Fig.15a was experimentally solved using VO2 oscillators and the SHIL schedule 
identified in this paper as SHIL1. They report a Max-Cut value equal to 10 with a 96% success rate with KPER over 600 
oscillation cycles. We have simulated the same graph with SHIL3. Computation time have been fixed to 600 cycles for

parameters: VMAX=0.4V, σNOISE = 1mV, TCOMP3. 

a fair comparison. In particular, three SHIL3 cycles with KPER= 100 have been applied. 20 Monte Carlo simulations for 
each of 50 different initial states have been carried out. Fig.15b depicts obtained results. Note that Max-Cut values 
higher than 10 have been obtained. In particular, the optimum solution to the problem (Max-Cut=12) have been obtained 
in 46.4% of the trials. Moreover, max-cut values equal or greater than 10 have been achieved in 96.1% of all the 
simulations. The experiment in [10] has been also simulated with our VO2 models. The optimum Max-Cut value is 
obtained in 14.8% of the trials. 
Additionally, these results indicate that the proposed SHIL scheme could also translate into advantages in terms of 
energy efficiency. In [10], as already mentioned, analysis results that show the potential of VO2 based OIMs to drastically 
increase operations per second and per watt with respect to platforms conventionally used to solve optimization 
problems are reported. The ability of SHIL3 to achieve higher success rates in shorter computation times could only 
contribute to increasing this figure of merit with respect to [10] that applied SHIL1. 
In summary, this simulation analysis has shown the potential of increasing and decreasing the SHIL amplitude to escape 
from local minimum energy states in OIMs associated to a six-node Max-Cut problem and the role of noise in this energy 
landscape exploration. However, experimental validation is  
mandatory.  This work is described in the next section, where, in addition, an exploration of different KPER values to 
further explore the annealing scheme is included. This was not addressed in the simulation framework due to limitations 
of computation times. However, we consider it interesting because of some reported results using SHIL1. According to 
[10], the probability of success increases with KPER (their annealing cycles). Thus, an open question is whether this 
statement holds for SHIL3.

or 12 cuts. 

Here, we experimentally investigate the OIM operation protocol using the triangular schedule (SHIL3). There is not a 
specific controllable source of noise like in simulation, but the one associated to the experimental setup. We designed 
a 9-node OIM proof-of-concept using off-the-shelf components on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) shown in Fig 16a. The 
OIM can implement any 9-node graph with various densities, where graph nodes are oscillators, and edges are synaptic 
capacitors. Each one of the 9(9-1)/2=36 synapses can be programmed by placing a discrete capacitor in the 
corresponding support. The oscillator circuit diagram is shown in Fig 16b and consists of a Schmitt trigger-based 
oscillator that charges and discharges a load capacitance CL, similar to a VO2 relaxation oscillator. The operating 
frequency of the OIM is 30kHz. Each oscillator has an SHIL input that receives the sinusoidal synchronization signal at 
f=60 kHz. An FPGA initializes and samples the phases at each oscillation cycle to enable real-time phase monitoring. 
The data are sent to a laptop and post-processed with MATLAB. 
 
For each experiment, we map the graph edges to 100 pF-coupling capacitors. For each one of the 100 trials, the 
oscillators are randomly initialized and driven by the triangular modulation (SHIL3) with two periods of 500 oscillation 
cycles each (Fig 16c with KPER=250). The cuts are computed based on four sets of phases sampled (read) at KPER, 
2∙KPER, 3∙KPER, and 4∙KPER oscillation cycles, and normalized by the Max-Cut value. Note that the sampling times t=KPER 
and t=3∙KPER cycles correspond to the largest SHIL amplitude, while SHIL is OFF when sampling at t=2∙KPER and 
t=4∙KPER cycles. Thus, comparing the four cuts when SHIL is maximum or minimum gives insight into the cut dynamics. 
So, we can experimentally validate that decreasing SHIL enables further exploration of the energy landscape.

Fig 17. The success rate for two-cycle SHIL3 with different KPER values. 

Fig 17 depicts the success rate for the 6-node in Fig 11 for different KPER values and the procedure described in the 
previous paragraph.   These results are consistent with the success rates obtained in the simulation experiments for 
TCOMP1. TCOMP1 corresponds to 1.5 SHIL3 cycles, similar to the 2 cycles used here. Note that identical quantitative results 
are not expected at all. 
Fig 18 depicts results also for the 6-node in Fig 11 with KPER=250, but now details of the four readings are shown. The 
histograms of the normalized cut vales measures when the SHIL amplitude is maximum (first and third histograms) are 
very different from those obtained with SHIL OFF (second and fourth histograms). Clearly, removing SHIL, the oscillator 
phases are unfrozen, as we explained before. Thus, allowing the displacement towards other regions of the energy 
landscape in which the minimum objective could eventually be found. Note that the number of trials producing the 
maximum max-cut is similar in readings 1 and 3, however, there are trials for which the first reading exhibits a suboptimal 
result but an optimum one in the second reading. This is demonstrated by the fact that if the best of all the readings is 
computed (purple bar in the fourth histogram), the number of attempts that produce a maximum cut is higher than that 
obtained for each of the readings.   
Identical experimental set-up has been applied to two unbalanced 9-node graphs, depicted in Fig 19 together with their 
histograms. Although improvements associated with the multi-reading triangular SHIL are observed, the success rate 
is under 50% for both examples.   
Therefore, we investigate alternative SHIL3 configurations assuming a computation time of 1000 oscillation cycles. That 
is, different values of KPER were used. Lower KPER values allow for more SHIL3 cycles to be accommodated in identical 
computation time. For a value of KPER=250, as in the previous experiment, two cycles of SHIL3 fit, while for a value of 
KPER =25 there is room for 20 cycles. Fig 20 shows the results obtained for the graph in Fig 19b. Fig 20a depicts 
histograms for KPER=26 at the 1st, 10th, and 19th SHIL3 cycles. Fig 20b (c) shows the average cut value over the 100 
trials versus the SHIL cycle, as well as the best cut for KPER=26 (58).   
It can be observed comparing Fig 19d and Fig 20a that the fraction of trials that reach the ground state or optimal 
solution to the Max-Cut problem is significantly increased. It is improved from less than 50% to 100%.   
It is also interesting to compare Fig 20b and c. The best cut smaller than 1 for KPER=58 (c) indicates that not all the trials 
led to an optimal solution, in comparison with KPER=26 (b). In the latter case, the evolution of the cut value is more 
attractive as it increases after each SHIL cycle. 
These results indicate that there seems to be an optimal KPER value for which the OIM is driven towards a lower energy 
state after each SHIL cycle. However, the optimal KPER value is graph-dependent as we had to adjust the KPER value for 
each graph instance to observe a similar behavior. Overall, a high KPER value corresponds to each SHIL cycle behaving 
like a new trial, i.e.  the OIM memory is lost during the sequence of SHIL cycles. With KPER<23 the results have 
worsened, not reaching the 100% success rate, as the SHIL period gets probably smaller than the OIM settling time. 
This was also observed in Fig 17 by sweeping the KPER value.

In summary, results obtained experimentally are in agreement with those found by electrical simulation. In particular, 
both simulation and experimental results have shown that running long SHIL cycles on our OIM does not necessarily 
improve the accuracy over time. We believe this is mainly caused by the unlocking of phases when SHIL is OFF which 
prevents any kind of memory throughout the SHIL operation. However, long SHIL cycles still enable the exploration of 
a wider region in the energy landscape from a single initial network state. A good compromise seems to occur when 
both OIM settling and SHIL ramping times are similar. In this regime, the OIM can escape local energy minima that are 
reached at each SHIL cycle. However, the OIM settling time depends on each input problem and thus the optimal KPER 
value is not unique. Finally, complementing the proposed SHIL schedule by taking the best cut value among several 
measurements can increase the success rate, and so the performance of the OIM for solving optimization problems.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This article has shown how a network of coupled oscillators can be operated to solve different computational tasks. It 
is one of the very few to explore the performance of coupled oscillator networks at the electrical level or by physical 
implementations. Phase-based simulations used in other works are hardware agnostic and do not consider important 
effects. Using VO2 based oscillators, the different operation conditions required to implement an AM or an IM machine 
with an identical architecture have been illustrated. The IM functionality requires being able to escape from local 
minimum energy states. Simulation-based analysis of the role of several factors such as SHIL signal, noise, or initial 
network state in that target behaviour has led to the proposal of a novel SHIL schedule. Its main feature is that the SHIL 
signal amplitude is increased and decreased. Reducing SHIL strength is the mechanism that enables escape from local 
minimum energy states. Its combination with a multi-reading scheme can improve the performance of the OIM for 
solving optimization problems. An experimental OIM has been built to validate our proposal and to further explore the 
impact of how fast the SHIL amplitude is varied. Our simulation and experimental results solving several instances of 
Max-Cut optimization problems contribute to a deeper understanding of how to operate a network of coupled oscillators 
as an Ising machine. Proposed SHIL schedule has shown potential for an efficient exploration of the energy landscape 
of the associated Ising model for the analyzed OIMs. However, selection of the parameters that configure the SHIL 
schedule, such as the KPER value or SHIL amplitude, is still an open question that requires further research to analyze 
graphs with different sparsity and size. Regarding the scalability of our proposal, it is appropriate to point out that this 
requires abandoning the idea of an all-to-all connection scheme and choosing a specific architecture. The selection of 
the said architecture and the mapping from the Ising model to the specific architecture is beyond the scope of this paper 
and is a future line of work.
