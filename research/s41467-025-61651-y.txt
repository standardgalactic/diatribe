Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators
induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic
phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay
between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due
to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-ﬁeld muon spin relaxation
(μSR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of
iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe1−xTex. For the Te composition
x = 0.64 with the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc = 14.5 K,
which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we
detect spontaneous magnetic ﬁelds below Tc distinct from a magnetic order.
This signiﬁes a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the con-
vergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically non-
trivial electronic structures in FeSe1−xTex. Given the relatively high Tc and the
tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide
superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy
between topological superconductivity and TRSB.
Symmetry breaking and topology are key concepts describing the
electronic states in quantum materials. In topological insulators
(TIs), the insulating band gap in the bulk is required to be closed at
the surface, leading to the gapless Dirac-cone dispersion (Fig. 1a),
which is protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In magnetic
TIs, however, broken TRS leads to the opening of a gap in the
TSS Dirac dispersion, as schematically shown in Fig. 1b1,2. With this
Dirac gap, magnetic TIs with TRSB exhibit one-dimensional gapless
chiral channels in the edges of top and bottom surfaces, leading to
a quantum anomalous Hall insulator state or an axion insulator
state

Much less understood is the case for topological super-
conductivity. Enormous efforts have been devoted to the search for
the Majorana bound states using several superconductors with topo-
logically nontrivial order parameters or proximity-induced super-
conductivity
in
topological
materials4-6,
but
the
results
and
interpretations remain largely controversial. Another promising
approach is to focus on bulk superconductors with topologically
nontrivial electronic structures in the normal state7-14. Among others,
the most signiﬁcant Majorana evidence has been obtained in the iron-
based superconductors FeSe1−xTex, which exhibit high Tc up to ~30 K
under pressure15 and high critical ﬁelds up to ~ 50 T16. In FeSe-based
superconductors17, the partial substitution of Se with Te shifts down
the chalcogen p band toward the Fermi level, making the topological
band inversion along Γ −Z direction of the Brillouin zone. Indeed, this
results in the observation of a Dirac TSS in FeSe1−xTex (x = 0.55)9,18, and
thus this system exhibits both bulk superconductivity and a topolo-
gical electronic structure. Moreover, clear zero-bias conductance
peaks in the fraction of superconducting vortices have been observed
by the high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy11, which can
be reproduced by considering the Majorana bands and disordered
vortex distribution19. These results make FeSe1−xTex a strong candidate
for topological superconductors. When TRS is broken in such a
topological superconducting state, the Dirac gap is formed (Fig. 1c,d),
which can lead to exotic properties such as chiral edge modes and
possibly non-Abelian statistics5.
To discuss the nature of superconductivity in FeSe1−xTex, let us
start with the underlying general phase diagrams of the FeSe-based
superconductors. Pure FeSe (x = 0) exhibits a nonmagnetic elec-
tronic nematic order, which can be suppressed by isovalent S or Te
substitution for Se20,21. In FeSe1−xSx, recent μSR measurements
reported evidence for TRSB in the superconducting state both in the
nematic (x < 0.17) and tetragonal (x > 0.17) regimes22. It has been
proposed that the TRSB superconductivity in the nematic phase of
FeSe1−xSx can be realized in an s + eiθd-wave state with the phase θ
changing from ~ 0 to ~ π near the nematic twin boundary22-25. In the
tetragonal phase, an anomalously large residual density of states in
the superconducting state has been observed22,26-28 in addition to
TRSB, which is consistent with an ultranodal state with Bogoliubov
Fermi surfaces29. In FeSe1−xTex, Tc initially decreases to a minimum
(Tc ~ 7 K) at x ~ 0.3, then rises again, reaching the maximum
Tc ~ 14.5 K near a nematic quantum critical point at x ~ 0.5, where
nematicity is completely suppressed15,21. By combining the phase
diagrams of FeSe1−xSx and FeSe1−xTex, it has been discussed that
these FeSe-based materials have three different superconducting
(SC) phases; SC1 phase in tetragonal FeSe1−xSx (x > 0.17), SC2 phase
showing
the
ﬁrst
dome
connecting
FeSe1−xSx
(x < 0.17)
and
FeSe1−xTex (x ≲0.3), and SC3 phase showing the second dome in
FeSe1−xTex (x ≳0.3)21. In this series, only the SC3 phase with the
highest Tc maximum includes the topological region30. As the TRSB
superconductivity has been reported by μSR measurements in SC1
and SC2 phases, here we perform the μSR measurements for 5 dif-
ferent compositions in SC3 phase; x ~ 0.35(5) within the nematic
regime, x = 0.64(2), 0.75(1), 0.83(1), and 0.94(1) in the tetragonal
regime (see Supplementary Information). We use collections of
single crystals prepared by chemical vapor transport (CVT) (x ~ 0.35)
and by Bridgman method with Te-annealing (x ≥0.64) (see Meth-
ods). It has been previously reported that low Te-substituted sam-
ples synthesized by CVT do not have excess irons15. In high-
concentration samples synthesized by the Bridgman method,
excess iron can be sufﬁciently removed by Te annealing31-33. Indeed,
in our measured samples, no signiﬁcant effects of excess irons on
the temperature dependence of magnetization and resistivity were
observed at least for samples with x ≤0.75 (see Supplementary
Information). Here we note that the end material FeTe (x = 1) exhi-
bits a long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of double stripe-
type, which suppresses bulk superconductivity34. Thus, the effect of
spin ﬂuctuations of this order should be considered for large x
regions. Moreover, recent experiments such as surface-sensitive
photoemission and Kerr effect30,35,36, diamond magnetometry37, as
well as scanning superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) microscopy and Josephson junctions using ﬂakes38,39 have
suggested the emergence of spontaneous ferromagnetism at the
surfaces or interfaces of FeSe1−xTex in the topological region. To
elucidate the nature of the superconducting state, it is essential to
investigate the bulk state of FeSe1−xTex from the μSR measurements.
Results
TRSB can be effectively studied by zero-ﬁeld (ZF) μSR, which detects
the magnetic ﬁeld inside the bulk of samples with high sensitivity in the
absence of external ﬁeld22,40. In the TRSB superconducting state, a
small magnetic ﬁeld can be induced near defects or boundaries of the
TRSB domains41, which enhances the relaxation rate of the ZF-μSR
asymmetry spectrum. Figure 2a-d show the results of ZF-μSR mea-
sured for the collections of single crystals of FeSe1−xTex in the nematic
phase (x ~ 0.35) and tetragonal phase (x = 0.64, 0.75 and 0.83). For
x ~ 0.35 (Tc ~ 8 K) and x = 0.64 (Tc = 14.5 K), the ZF-μSR asymmetry
spectra in the superconducting state (T < Tc) shows faster relaxation
than that in the normal state (T > Tc) (Fig. 2a, b). We ﬁt these asym-
metry spectra using the stretched and simple exponential functions (as
described in Supplementary Information). The temperature depen-
dence of the relaxation rate obtained from the ﬁttings is shown in
Fig. 2e, f. The temperature-independent relaxation observed in the
normal state can be attributed to randomly aligned nuclear magnetic
moments, ﬂuctuating at a rate slower than the μSR timescale. An
important observation is that the relaxation rates are enhanced in the
superconducting state for both non-spin-rotated (NSR) and spin-
rotated (SR) conﬁguration modes, indicating the emergence of mag-
netic ﬁelds in the superconducting state. We also ﬁnd that the tem-
perature dependence of the relaxation rate in ZF-μSR is similar to that
in transverse ﬁeld (TF) measurements (see Fig. S5), which represents
the temperature dependence of the superﬂuid density (an order
parameter of superconductivity). Moreover, under a longitudinal ﬁeld
(LF) of 100 G (x ~ 0.35) or 200 G (x = 0.64), we ﬁnd that the relaxation
rate is much suppressed and its temperature dependence becomes
weaker than the ZF results (Fig. 2e, f). Such a suppression of the LF
relaxation is due to the muons being decoupled from the internal ﬁeld
by the weak LF, implying that the enhancement of relaxation observed
in ZF-μSR is due to a static ﬁeld rather than a dynamic one. These
ﬁndings indicate that TRS is broken in the superconducting state in the
bulk below an onset temperature TTRSB ( ≲Tc) in these compositions
(x ~ 0.35 and x = 0.64) of FeSe1−xTex. In x = 0.64, the onset temperature
of TRSB (TTRSB ~ 11.5 ± 1.5 K, Fig. 2f) is consistent with the result of the
previous Kerr effect measurement36. Note that although the Kerr
measurement is a surface-sensitive technique and suggests some sur-
face magnetism, the present μSR detects deep in the bulk with much
longer stopping depth than the coherence length, implying that the
bulk superconductivity breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also note
that the early-stage studies on polycrystalline samples of FeSe-based
superconductors with impurity phases (excess-Fe in FeSe0.98
42 and
Fe3O4 inclusions in FeSe0.5Te0.5
43) have shown no enhancement of ZF-
μSR relaxation rate, possibly due to the background contributions that
can mask the intrinsic signal. These results imply that the enhanced
relaxation rate observed in the superconducting state of well-
characterized single crystals does not arise from the combination of
superconductivity and magnetic impurities, even if present.
In comparisons, the asymmetry spectra of ZF- and LF-μSR for
x = 0.75 and 0.83 single crystals, which are close to the anti-
ferromagnetic (AFM) phase of FeTe, are shown in Fig. 2c, d. In these
compositions, we do not observe any clear AFM transitions by DC
magnetization
measurements
(see
Supplementary
Information).

However, the ZF- and LF-μSR spectra of these compositions exhibit
two major differences from those of x ~ 0.35 and x = 0.64. First, for
x = 0.75 and 0.83, we observe two distinct relaxation components in
time spectra of asymmetry: a fast relaxation in the initial time region
(t < 1 μs) followed by another slower relaxation. We ﬁt these spectra
using a two-component exponential function (see Supplementary
Information) and obtain the temperature dependence of the fast and
slow relaxation rates (Fig. 2g, h). The fast relaxation rate is con-
siderably larger than the slow relaxation, exceeding ~ 10 μs−1 at the
lowest temperature. Another key difference is that neither the fast nor
slow relaxation components are suppressed under an application of LF
200 G, which is at odds with the results in x ~ 0.35 and x = 0.64. In
addition, the increase of both relaxation rates starts from a char-
acteristic temperature T* > Tc for both x = 0.75 and x = 0.83. These
results imply that the fundamental causes of both types of relaxation
are unrelated to the superconducting state.
To further clarify the effects of AFM order near the FeTe end, we
also measure the x = 0.94 samples, which show a clear AFM transition
at TN ~ 45 K in DC magnetization (see Supplementary Information).
Figure 3a shows the ZF-μSR spectra for various temperatures (2 K <
T ≤70 K) in x = 0.94 single crystals. Similar to the results of x = 0.75 and
0.83, we obtain two-component ZF relaxation curves, characterized by
the fast relaxation in the initial time window followed by the slower
relaxation in the AFM phase below TN. The fast relaxation is vanishing
above ~TN. As shown in Fig. 3b, the temperature dependence of the
relaxation rate obtained from our ﬁtting (see Supplementary Infor-
mation) clearly shows that the fast component appears below TN, and
that both fast and slow relaxations are not suppressed in the LF-μSR. A
distinctdifference from the results of x ≤0.83 samples is the signiﬁcant
loss of initial asymmetry A0 at low temperatures in ZF- and LF-μSR
(Fig. 3a, d). Such a loss of initial fast asymmetry is commonly observed
in the presence of the inhomogeneous magnetic phase44,45. To esti-
mate the magnetic volume fraction, we also measure the weak trans-
verse ﬁeld (wTF)-μSR. The amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in
wTF is proportional to the paramagnetic volume fraction, and thus we
can estimate the magnetic volume fraction from the amplitude loss
(see Supplementary Information). Our results of wTF-μSR show that
the amplitude loss starts from TN ~ 45 K (Fig. 3c, d), consistent with the
ZF- and LF-μSR, and the magnetic volume fraction is estimated to be
~90% atlow temperatures (Fig. 3e). Similar results of the amplitude loss
in the wTF-μSR spectra together with the absence of oscillations in ZF-
μSR have been reported in previous studies of Fe1+ySexTe1−x with ~3%
excess Fe, which exhibit the incommensurate AFM order46.
Discussion
Our μSR measurements in FeSe1−xTex reveal signiﬁcant differences in
the microscopic properties of electronic states between x ≤0.64 and
x ≥0.75. For x = 0.75 and 0.83, we have no evidence of long-range AFM
order, but we observe the initial fast relaxation at low temperatures
somewhat similar to the AFM state. These compositions are close to
the AFM ordered phase (x ≳0.9), and thus the observed fast relaxation
is likely attributed to short-range AFM correlations of double-stripe
type. Indeed, such an initial fast relaxation is often observed in other
materials with short-range ordered or inhomogeneous magnetic pha-
ses, such as spin glasses, especially near the magnetically ordered
phase44,47. The presence of the short-range AFM in x = 0.75 and 0.83 is

Fig. 1 | Schematic comparisons between topological insulators (TIs) and
superconductors (SCs) having topological surface states (TSSs) with and
without time-reversal symmetry (TRS). a In TIs with TRS, the insulating gap exists
in the bulk, which closes at the surfaces with a Dirac-cone dispersion with spin
momentum locking (red and blue arrows). b Magnetism in TIs breaks TRS, which
induces the Dirac gap at the surfaces. c In TRS-preserved superconductors with

also supported by the ZF and LF-μSR spectra, which show the tem-
perature dependence of relaxation rate even above Tc = 14 and 11 K.
This is in sharp contrast with the spectra for x ~ 0.35 and x = 0.64, which
show T-independent relaxation above Tc ~ 8 K and Tc = 14.5 K, respec-
tively (Fig. 2e-h).
The difference between x ≤0.64 and x ≥0.75 is further corrobo-
rated by the magnetization and speciﬁc heat measurements at low
temperatures. For x ≥0.75, a ﬁnite residual density of state in the
superconducting state is resolved, indicative of a fraction of non-
superconducting regions (Fig. S2). Thus, our results suggest that the
short-range AFM order and superconducting phase coexist below Tc,
contributing to the observed fast relaxation for x ≥0.75. In contrast,
the residual density of states in the zero-temperature limit for x ≤0.64
is almost zero, which indicates that we have no AFM short-range order,
consistent with the absence of the fast relaxation in the ZF-μSR.
From our systematic μSR measurements of FeSe1−xTex together
with the previous studies of FeSe1−xSx
22, we have obtained the phase
diagram of FeSe-based superconductors as shown in Fig. 4. Within the
nematic phase of pure FeSe, FeSe1−xSx (x ≲0.17), and FeSe1−xTex
(x ≲0.5), TRSB superconductivity with a small internal ﬁeld ( ~ 0.1 G) is
observed, suggesting the realization of the TRSB s + eiθd-wave state in
the bulk or near the nematic twin boundaries17,22. In the tetragonal
phase of FeSe1−xSx (x ≳0.17), an ultranodal state with the Bogoliubov
Fermi surface (BFS) has been proposed29, which can explain the TRSB
and the residual density of states observed in clean samples22,26,28. In
FeSe1−xTex side, we ﬁnd the coexistence of short-range AFM with
superconductivity for high Te composition (x = 0.75 and 0.83), and a
long-range AFM order is conﬁrmed for x = 0.94. Most importantly, we
discover the bulk TRSB superconductivity in the tetragonal phase at
x = 0.64, without a sign of inclusion of magnetic order. The x depen-
dence of the fraction ffast of the fast relaxation in the ZF-μSR spectra
and the residual electronic speciﬁc heat Ce/γT∣T→0 (left axis on the
lower panel of Fig. 4) indicates the full superconducting volume for
x ≤0.64. In FeSe1−xTex in a range including x = 0.64, topologically
nontrivial electronic structures are found with the TSS, and thus our
observation implies that the bulk TRSB superconductivity meets with
TSS. This ﬁnding clariﬁes that the bulk TRSB pairing state induces the
Dirac gap in TSS and possibly ferromagnetic-like signatures as repor-
ted previously30,35-37,39.
From our ZF-μSR experiments, the TRSB internal ﬁeld values at
the lowest temperature are estimated as Bint = 0.09 (0.62) G for
x ~ 0.35 and 0.76 (1.53) G for x = 0.64 in the NSR (SR) mode,
respectively. Within the nematic phase, our previous NSR-mode
study for FeSe22 reported consistent value of Bint = 0.1 G with the
present result for x ~ 0.35. FeSe has compensated hole and electron
bands, and the gap structure is highly anisotropic, which accounts
for the energy proximity of s-wave and d-wave superconducting
states17. Such a superconducting state of FeSe can be realized in the
complex order parameter s + eiθd-wave state with its phase θ
deviating from 0 or π in bulk and changes near the twin boundaries,
which has been theoretically proposed23,48. The variation in θ implies
that the superconducting gap has a characteristic change near the
twin boundaries, which has been supported in STM and ARPES
measurements24,25.
Meanwhile, in x = 0.64, a larger spontaneous ﬁeld of ~1 G is found
in the superconducting state. This value is notably larger than the
spontaneous
ﬁelds
typically
observed
in
other
TRSB
superconductors22,40. As x = 0.64 is in the tetragonal phase, the TRSB
pairing state with such a large ﬁeld is different from that in the
nematic phase. Indeed, the temperature dependence of electronic
speciﬁc heat Ce/T at low temperatures shows a very ﬂat dependence
with no residual term in x = 0.64 indicative of well-developed full
gap, which is in sharp contrast to the strong T dependence with
anisotropic gap inside the nematic phase (Fig. S2b). A possible TRSB
pairing that produces such a large spontaneous ﬁeld in a tetragonal
FeSe1−xTex has been proposed in terms of symmetry-based theore-
tical analysis and the inﬂuence of spin-orbit interaction49,50. In
FeSe1−xTex, the superconducting gap symmetry of A1(2)g, B1(2)g, and
E1(2)g are nearly degenerate, in which case the mean-ﬁeld theory
favors a TRSB pairing with a phase difference of ± π
2 between the two

degenerate functions50. Such TRSB pairing can lead to a spontaneous
ﬁeld along the z-axis, and the strong spin-orbit coupling with Te can
enhance it and induce a Dirac gap below the Fermi energy49,50. Our
results show a larger relaxation in the SR mode, a conﬁguration more
sensitive to the internal ﬁeld along the c-axis, which is consistent with
the above theory. However, additional investigations are essential to
fully elucidate the nature and detail of the TRSB pairing state in
FeSe1−xTex.
Finally, in the magnetic topological insulator, doping with
magnetic elements or making the heterostructure with magnetic
materials can break TRS, inducing a Dirac gap. In these systems,
tuning the chemical potential within the gap leads to various topo-
logical phenomena, including the quantum anomalous Hall effect
and topological (axion) electrodynamics1,51,52, making them sig-
niﬁcant subjects in modern physics. The present results showing the
coexistence of the TRSB superconducting state and nontrivial
topology in FeSe1−xTex promise a playground for studying novel
synergy effects of TRSB and topology in superconductors, with the
capability of the chemical potential control by chemical substitution
or doping. Our ﬁndings provide evidence for the realization of a
time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconducting state in
the bulk of iron-chalcogenide superconductors, and suggest the
possibility of a novel TRSB superconducting state intertwined with
nontrivial band topology.
Methods
Single crystal growth
Single crystals of FeSe1−xTex (x ~ 0.35) were grown by the chemical
vapor transport (CVT) technique15. Fe, Se, and Te powders were
mixed with AlCl3 and KCl and sealed in a quartz ampoule as transport
agents. The temperatures of the source and sink sides were con-
trolled from 620−450 ∘C, respectively. The Te compositions of single
crystals were determined by the c-axis length measured by X-ray
diffraction (XRD)15,21.
Single crystals with high Te compositions (x ≥0.64) were grown
by the Bridgman method. Initial materials of Fe, Te, and Se with
nominal composition Fe1.03Se1−xTex were mixed and sealed into a
quartz tube. Obtained quartz ampoule was heated at 1050 ∘C for 85 h,
and then cooled down to 550 ∘C at a rate of 4 ∘C/h under a temperature
gradient of around 8 ∘C/cm, and ﬁnally cooled down to room tem-
perature in the furnace. In order to remove excess Fe, as-grown crys-
tals were annealed under Te vapor. They were sealed with pulverized
Te into a Pyrex tube and heated at 400 ∘C for >300 h31,32. The Te
compositions of these single crystals were determined by energy-
dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (see Supplementary Information).

the pink arrow. c Time spectra of the asymmetry in the weak transverse ﬁeld (wTF)-

dependence of the initial asymmetry A0 in ZF (blue circles), LF (green circles), and
wTF-μSR (red circles). For wTF-μSR, A0 is estimated from the oscillation amplitude
at the initial time. e Temperature dependence of the magnetic volume fraction
estimated from the temperature-dependent loss of the oscillation amplitude in the
wTF-μSR spectra (see Supplementary Information). Error bars for asymmetry are
estimated from the statistical noise. Error bars for relaxation rate are estimated
from the uncertainties of the ﬁtting.

spectrometer. We performed Zero-ﬁeld (ZF), longitudinal-ﬁeld (LF),
and transverse-ﬁeld (TF) μSR experiments at the M20D beamline. For
ZF-μSR, to achieve accurate zero ﬁelds at the sample position, it was
calibrated using a Hall probe and achieved a magnetic ﬁeld <1 mG.
Both non-spin rotated (NSR) and spin rotated (SR) mode were mea-
sured in ZF-μSR. Besides, we performed the LF-μSR measurements
with NSR mode and TF-μSR with SR mode because the magnetic ﬁeld
could be applied along only the c-axis of the sample (beam axis).
Samples were aligned with the c-axis perpendicular to the beam axis
and parallel to the muon spin direction in spin rotation (SR) mode,
mounted in wrapped mylar tape. More details on the experimental
setup and data analysis are provided in Supplementary Information.
Resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements
The electrical resistivity was measured at ambient pressure by the
4-terminal method using a Physical Property Measurement System
(PPMS) from Quantum Design with the lowest temperature of about 2 K.
The magnetization was measured by using a Magnetic Property Mea-
surement System (MPMS) from Quantum Design. The speciﬁc heat
measurements were performed by adiabatic method with using PPMS
for x≥0.64 and the long relaxation method with 3He cryostat for x ~ 0.3527.

Schematic phase diagram of temperature versus S/Te composition obtained in this
study for FeSe1−xTex, combined with the reported results of FeSe1−xSx
22. Ts (blue
line), TN (pink line), and Tc (black line) denote the nematic, antiferromagnetic
(AFM), and superconducting transition temperatures, respectively15,17,21. The onsets
of TRSB superconducting states TTRSB (red circles) and short-range AFM T* (orange
triangles) are obtained from ZF-μSR. The superconducting state is divided to the
possible ultranodal state (purple shade) with Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) in the
tetragonal phase of FeSe1−xSx (x > 0.17), the ﬁrst superconducting dome inside the
nematic phase (yellow shade), topologically nontrivial state with high Tc near
x = 0.64 in FeSe1−xTex (green shade), and the coexistence region x ≳0.75 between
short-range AFM and superconductivity (orange shade). Error bars for x are esti-
mated from the variation of compositions. Error bars of transition temperatures are
estimated from the threshold noise level. (Middle panel) Spontaneous ﬁeld in the
bulk of TRSB superconducting states estimated from the NSR (orange diamonds)
and SR (blue diamonds) modes of ZF-μSR. Error bars are estimated by considering
the comparisons between ZF and LF data. (Bottom plane) The residual density of
states from the electronic speciﬁc heat data, Ce/γT (purple triangles, left axis),
estimated by the extrapolation of Ce/T to T →0, where γ is the normal-state Som-
merfeld constant. Fraction of fast relaxation in the two-component analysis of ZF-
μSR at the lowest temperature ~2 K is also shown (green pentagons, right axis).
Error bars are estimated from the uncertainties from the extrapolations.
