Abstract
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework offers a recursive, field-theoretic
alternative to reductionist symbolic AI and opaque black-box machine learning, addressing
Martin Ciupa's Gödelian critique of Monica Anderson's The Red Pill of Machine Learning.
RSVP posits that understanding emerges from internal recursion—exemplified by sensory
rivalry processes like blink comparison and binocular/binaural rivalry—rather than tran-
scendent logic. The Chain of Memory (CoM) paradigm complements RSVP by encoding
reasoning as causally traceable latent memory trajectories, resolving Ciupa's concern about
epistemic blindness. Empirical support from neuroscience (e.g., binocular circuit plasticity,
"weird shading" orientation fields) and computational models (e.g., Mixture-of-Recursions)
aligns with RSVP's scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) field dynamics. Together, RSVP
and CoM redefine Gödelian incompleteness as a navigable topological feature, proposing a
recursive epistemology for cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

Introduction: Machine Learning's Epistemic Crisis
Monica Anderson's The Red Pill of Machine Learning critiques reductionist, symbolic ap-
proaches to artificial intelligence, advocating for holistic, model-free machine learning. Martin
Ciupa responds with a Gödelian caution, arguing that black-box systems, while performant,
lack reflective understanding due to their inability to justify outputs [?]. This raises a critical
question: can systems "know what they know" without reflective scaffolding? The Relativis-
tic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, augmented by the Chain of Memory (CoM)
paradigm, proposes a third path, leveraging recursive field dynamics and latent causality to
achieve understanding without external transcendence.

Gödel's Warning and the Inside/Outside Problem
Gödel's incompleteness theorems demonstrate that no consistent formal system can prove all
truths within itself or verify its own consistency. Ciupa applies this to machine learning, arguing
that deep learning's syntactic nature lacks semantic grounding, rendering systems epistemically
blind [?]. Without stepping outside themselves, models face semantic closure, producing outputs
without justifying their epistemic validity, a limitation evident in Chain of Thought (CoT)
approaches that rely on post hoc narratives.

RSVP as an Alternative: Recursion Without Transcendence
The RSVP framework models cognition as the interplay of scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy
(S) fields:
• Scalar Field (Φ): Encodes salience or coherence, representing stimulus intensity.
1

• Vector Field (v): Captures directional flow or pathway bias.
• Entropy Field (S): Quantifies uncertainty, driving resolution.
Understanding emerges from recursive feedback within these fields, not external logical struc-
tures. Gödelian incompleteness is reinterpreted as a topological contour in field space, navigable
through iterative rivalry and convergence.

Binocular Rivalry and Recursive Rivalry
Perceptual rivalry, such as binocular rivalry (competing visual inputs) and binaural rivalry
(competing auditory inputs), serves as a primitive recursive comparator. RSVP interprets cog-
nition as the resolution of internal tensions, akin to the brain's harmonization of conflicting
sensory inputs. Blink comparison—rapid alternation of inputs—facilitates gradient-based field
alignment, enhancing rivalry dynamics [?]. Recursion, not symbolic modeling, drives this pro-
cess, aligning with RSVP's field-theoretic principles.

From MoR to RSVP: Dynamic Recursion in Computation
The Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) architecture in transformer models assigns dynamic recursion
depths to tokens based on informational tension, using key-value (KV) caching and selective
attention. MoR aligns with RSVP:
• Recursion depth corresponds to vector field (v) tension.
• KV reuse reflects memory dynamics in the entropy field (S).
RSVP generalizes MoR, modeling cognition as adaptive field dynamics that process structure
recursively, without symbolic meta-layers.

Synaptic Plasticity and Visual Cortex Rivalry
Neuroscientific evidence from Tsimring et al. (?) demonstrates that visual experience recon-
structs binocular circuits through dendritic spine turnover, driven by Hebbian and heterosy-
naptic plasticity. This process mirrors RSVP's recursive rivalry:
• Scalar (Φ): Salience-driven neural activity.
• Vector (v)): Synaptic alignment and pathway bias.
• Entropy (S): Uncertainty resolution through plasticity.
Biological cognition thus parallels RSVP's framework, where recursive convergence underlies
emergent understanding.
7
Weird Shading, Blink Comparison, and Orientation Fields
Aubuchon et al. (?) show that "weird shading"—non-physically accurate luminance patterns—
yields accurate 3D perception by preserving orientation fields, or luminance "streaks" encoding
3D curves. This supports RSVP's emphasis on field coherence over physical fidelity. Blink com-
parison enhances this process by alternating inputs, driving recursive rivalry akin to binocular
rivalry. RSVP models this through iterative updates of scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S)
fields, achieving perceptual understanding through gradient-based synchronization.

Chain of Memory and Gödelian Faithfulness
Martin Ciupa's Gödelian critique posits that machine learning systems, being syntactic, cannot
reflect on their causal structure, rendering them epistemically blind [?]. The Chain of Memory
(CoM) paradigm addresses this by redefining reasoning as a trajectory of transformations in
a structured latent memory space, rather than linear token sequences as in Chain of Thought
(CoT). Each memory state Mi = (Φi(x), vi(x), Si(x)) causally contributes to outputs, with
transformations defined as:
Mi+1 = ϕ(Mi, ui, ci),
(1)
where ui is the input update and ci the context, ensuring differentiable traceability via:
I(Mi →y) = ∂y
∂Mi
.
(2)
This allows outputs to be audited or perturbed, providing epistemic transparency without
symbolic narration.
CoM redefines reflection as recursion over latent memory, aligning with RSVP's field dynam-
ics. Gödel's inside/outside problem is recast: systems need not transcend themselves if they can
recursively reorganize memory contours. CoM's latent evolution mirrors RSVP's recursive ri-
valry, with scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields encoding memory states. Unlike CoT's
narrative confabulations, CoM's reasoning is mechanistic, with interpretation as an optional
projection. This resolves Ciupa's concern by embedding causal faithfulness within the system,
transforming Gödelian incompleteness into a navigable gradient.
CoM-RSVP hybrids, such
as Reflect-RL or GUI Odyssey-CoM, demonstrate this in practice, offering a computationally
tractable path to reflective AI.

Conclusion: Toward a Recursive Epistemology
The pursuit of machine understanding has oscillated between transparent logic and opaque
performance.
Monica Anderson's model-free holism and Martin Ciupa's Gödelian critique
highlight this tension: statistical success versus reflective structure [??]. The RSVP frame-
work, augmented by the Chain of Memory (CoM), offers a third path. By grounding cognition
in recursive field dynamics—scalar salience (Φ), vector flow (v), and entropy reduction (S)—
RSVP dissolves the binary between reductionism and holism. CoM operationalizes this through
causally traceable latent memory trajectories, ensuring epistemic faithfulness without symbolic
transcendence.
Biological perception, from binocular rivalry to "weird shading" orientation fields, and com-
putational recursion, as in Mixture-of-Recursions, converge on a shared principle: understanding
emerges from internal rivalry and convergence [??]. Gödel's incompleteness is not a barrier but
a topological gradient, navigated through recursive field updates. The future of AI and cogni-
tive science lies in cultivating recursion within systems, not simulating cognition from above.
RSVP and CoM provide a unified framework—recursive, geometric, and causally faithful—for
a new epistemology of intelligence.

RSVP's variational dynamics generalize this, with memory states as attractors in entropy-guided
field space.

Mathematical Formalism of RSVP and CoM
The RSVP framework models cognition through coupled scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy
(S) fields, updated iteratively to minimize divergence and achieve coherence. The dynamics are
governed by:
Φ(t + 1) = Φ(t) + α∇· v −βS,
(5)
v(t + 1) = v(t) + γ∇Φ −δ∇S,
(6)
S(t + 1) = S(t) −ϵdiv(v) + η∇2Φ,
(7)
where α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, η are coupling parameters controlling field interactions. These equations de-
scribe how salience (Φ), directional flow (v), and uncertainty (S) evolve, with recursive rivalry
driving convergence.
In the Chain of Memory (CoM), reasoning is modeled as a sequence of memory states
Mi = (Φi(x), vi(x), Si(x)), updated via:
Mi+1 = ϕ(Mi, ui, ci),
(8)
where ϕ is a transformation function, ui is the input update, and ci is the context. The causal
influence of each state on outputs y is quantified as:
I(Mi →y) = ∂y
∂Mi
.

This ensures traceability, allowing interventions to test epistemic necessity.
The alignment
between CoM and RSVP is formalized by mapping memory states to field configurations, with
ϕ incorporating gradient-based updates akin to RSVP's field dynamics. For example, context ci
may modulate S to prioritize relevant memory attractors, aligning with RSVP's entropy-guided
inference.
These formalisms enable RSVP and CoM to model recursive rivalry as a unified process,
bridging biological plasticity (e.g., synaptic turnover in ?) and computational recursion (e.g.,
MoR). Diagram Placeholder: A future figure could visualize CoT (linear tokens), CoM
(latent trajectories), and RSVP (field dynamics), using nodes and arrows to depict recursive
feedback.
